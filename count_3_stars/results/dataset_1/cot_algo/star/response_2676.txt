Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes where 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 can form C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 4+4+4+4+4 = 20. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>.
