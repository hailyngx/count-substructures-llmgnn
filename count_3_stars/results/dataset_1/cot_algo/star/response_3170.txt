Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- The total number of 3-stars is 10.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
