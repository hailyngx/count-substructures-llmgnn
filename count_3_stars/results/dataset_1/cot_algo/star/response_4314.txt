Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6

Now, let's apply the combinatorial calculation to find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)   (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)   (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (4 unique 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
