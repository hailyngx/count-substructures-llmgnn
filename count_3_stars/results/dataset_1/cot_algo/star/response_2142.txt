Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph with the given edges:

```
   0 -- 1 -- 3 -- 4
   |    |    |    |
   5    8    9    2
                  |
                  6
```

Next, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, 5, 8 (degree is 4)
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 (degree is 6)
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 4, 6, 7, 8 (degree is 5)
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (degree is 6)
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 9 (degree is 4)
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 3, 9 (degree is 3)
- Node 6: Neighbor is 2 (degree is 1)
- Node 7: Neighbor is 1, 2, 3 (degree is 3)
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3 (degree is 4)
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 (degree is 5)

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures:
- There are no 3-stars with nodes 6 or 7 as they don't have at least 3 neighbors.
- For Node 0, there is 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- For Node 1, there are 4 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- For Node 2, there is 1 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- For Node 3, there are 4 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- For Node 4, there is 1 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- For Node 5, there is 1 3-star: <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- For Node 8, there is 1 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- For Node 9, there is 1 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>
