Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 7

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0 has 7 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [35 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 53 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
