Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
    0 --- 2 --- 1
    |     |     |
    5 --- 8     6 --- 3
           |     |
           4     |
                 7
                 |
                 9
```

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: Neighbors = {2, 5}. No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.

For node 1: Neighbors = {2}. No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.

For node 2: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6}. It has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars:
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>

For node 3: Neighbors = {6}. No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.

For node 4: Neighbor = {8}. No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.

For node 5: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8}. It has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star:
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>

For node 6: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 9}. It has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars:
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>

For node 7: Neighbor = {6}. No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.

For node 8: Neighbors = {4, 5}. No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.

For node 9: Neighbor = {6}. No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.

Putting all the unique 3-stars together, we get:
Total number of 3-stars = [4 + 1 + 4] = [9]
Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>
