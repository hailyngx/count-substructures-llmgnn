Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 10 + 4 = 34 \), so the answer is [34].
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>
