Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {2, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 8}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 29, so [29].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
