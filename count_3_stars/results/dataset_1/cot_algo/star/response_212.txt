Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 1, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 1, Node 6, and Node 7 have 3 neighbors each.

For nodes with 4 neighbors (Node 0, Node 2, and Node 9), we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

For nodes with 3 neighbors (Node 1, Node 6, and Node 7):
- Since they have exactly 3 neighbors, they each form only 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars formed: 4 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 2) + 20 (from Node 9) + 1 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 6) + 1 (from Node 7) = 31

Therefore, the final answer is [31] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <6, 1, 7>
- <7, 0, 2>
