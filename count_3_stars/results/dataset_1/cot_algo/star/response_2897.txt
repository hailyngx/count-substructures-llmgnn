Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 7

Now, we will check each node to see if they have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, and <7, (0, 3, 6)>.
