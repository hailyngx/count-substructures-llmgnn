Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Next, we'll find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1 has 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2 has 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3 has no 3-stars
- Node 4 has no 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6 has 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7 has 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8 has 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9 has no 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, and their permutations.
