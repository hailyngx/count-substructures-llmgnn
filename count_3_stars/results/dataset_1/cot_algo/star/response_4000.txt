Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 0)>
- <2, (4, 5, 0)>
- <2, (4, 6, 0)>
- <3, (4, 5, 0)>
- <3, (4, 6, 0)>
