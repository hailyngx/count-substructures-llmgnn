Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: (1, 6)
- Node 1: (0, 2, 7)
- Node 2: (1)
- Node 3: (5, 7)
- Node 4: (6, 7)
- Node 5: (3)
- Node 6: (0, 4)
- Node 7: (1, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 9: (7)

Next, we identify which nodes can form 3-stars:
Node 1, 4, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1+4] = 5

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
