Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7, and 8.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [8]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 7)>
