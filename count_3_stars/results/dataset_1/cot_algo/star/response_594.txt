Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 6}
Node 1: {2, 7}
Node 2: {1, 9}
Node 3: {0}
Node 4: {8, 9}
Node 5: {8}
Node 6: {0}
Node 7: {1}
Node 8: {4, 5, 9}
Node 9: {2, 4, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: 2 neighbors
Node 1: 2 neighbors
Node 2: 2 neighbors
Node 3: Not considered as it has less than 3 neighbors
Node 4: 2 neighbors
Node 5: Not considered
Node 6: Not considered
Node 7: Not considered
Node 8: 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star
Node 9: 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 = 2. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

So, the final result is [2].
