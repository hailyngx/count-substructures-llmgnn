Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {3, 5}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is $[4]$.

The unique 3-stars are: <5, (0, 8, 9)> <5, (4, 8, 9)> <5, (0, 4, 8)> <5, (0, 4, 9)>.
