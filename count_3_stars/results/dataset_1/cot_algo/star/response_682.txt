Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1 has neighbors: 5
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0
- Node 3 has neighbors: 6
- Node 4 has neighbors: 6, 8, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 4, 5, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [18]. The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>.
