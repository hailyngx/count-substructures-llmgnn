Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 5}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [4 + 10 + 4 + 1] = [19]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 9)>
