Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - <4, (0, 1, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 = 11, so the answer is [11].
