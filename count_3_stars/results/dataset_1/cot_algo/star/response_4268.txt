Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 2, 6
Node 2: 1, 6, 9
Node 3: 6
Node 4: 7
Node 5: 0, 7, 8
Node 6: 1, 2, 3
Node 7: 0, 4, 5
Node 8: 0, 5
Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's identify how many 3-stars can be formed in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
