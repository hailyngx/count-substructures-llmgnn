Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 6, 7, 8

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [1, 4, 7] -> inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: [4, 5, 7] -> inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [4, 5, 7, 8] -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: [0, 2, 3, 5, 8] -> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [2, 3, 4, 8] -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: [0, 2, 3, 9] -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [3, 4, 5, 9] -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: [6, 7, 8] -> inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [29]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (4, 8, 9)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [29].
