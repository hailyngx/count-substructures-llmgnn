Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 4, and Node 9 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) for Node 1, Node 4, and Node 9.
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) for Node 3.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [34] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
