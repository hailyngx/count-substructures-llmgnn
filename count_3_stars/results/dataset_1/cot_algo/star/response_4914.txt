Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on the nodes they connect:

- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's consider the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 2, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1, 6 (2 neighbors)
- Node 3: 4, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 4: 3, 8, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 3, 6 (2 neighbors)
- Node 6: 2, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 7: 1, 8 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 4, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: 4 (1 neighbor)

Next, we need to identify the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 4 and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 cannot form a 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <4, (3, 8, 9)>.
