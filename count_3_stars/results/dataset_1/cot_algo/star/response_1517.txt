Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 9, 1)>
