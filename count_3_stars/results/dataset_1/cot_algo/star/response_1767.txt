Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: [1 3-star]
- Node 1: [4 3-stars] <1, (3, 6, 9)> <1, (5, 6, 9)> <1, (3, 5, 6)> <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 3: [1 3-star]
- Node 5: [2 3-stars] <5, (4, 8, 9)> <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: [1 3-star]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1] = [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>.
