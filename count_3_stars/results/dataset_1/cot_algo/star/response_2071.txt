Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 2
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 3, 6
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 3, 6, 7
- Node 6 neighbors: 2, 5, 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 4
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 3

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars:
Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
