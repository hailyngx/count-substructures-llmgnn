Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we can first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 1: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {1, 7}
- Node 4: {6, 7}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {4, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars based on the neighbors:
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1] = 14

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 4)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>
