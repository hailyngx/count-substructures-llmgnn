Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0's neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1's neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2's neighbors: 3, 4
- Node 3's neighbors: 0, 2, 4
- Node 4's neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5's neighbor: 0
- Node 6's neighbors: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8's neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 9's neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 9: <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 9: <1, (6, 8, 9)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] in this graph is [2].
