Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:
- 0: 2, 4, 5, 9
- 1: 2, 3, 8
- 2: 0, 1, 8
- 3: 1, 4
- 4: 0, 3
- 5: 0, 6, 8, 9
- 6: 5
- 7: 8
- 8: 1, 2, 5, 7
- 9: 0, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>.
