Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

0: [1, 5, 8, 9]
1: [0, 2, 6, 8]
2: [1, 3, 8, 9]
3: [2, 4, 6, 7]
4: [3]
5: [0, 7, 8]
6: [1, 3]
7: [3, 5, 9]
8: [0, 1, 2, 5, 9]
9: [0, 2, 7, 8]

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 32

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>
