Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 3

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10 \)

Therefore, the final result is [10] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 1)>, <7, (4, 6, 5)>, 
<7, (4, 6, 7)>
