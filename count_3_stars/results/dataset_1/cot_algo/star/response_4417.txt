Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 5}
- Node 7: {2, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 3}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, in total, there are 3 3-stars in the graph: 

\[ [3] \]

The unique 3-stars are:

1. <1, (5, 8, 9)>
2. <3, (0, 6, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 2, 7)>
