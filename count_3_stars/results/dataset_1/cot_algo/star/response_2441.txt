Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3, 5, 8 (has 3 neighbors, form 1 3-star)
- Node 2: 3, 8, 9 (has 3 neighbors, form 1 3-star)
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8 (has 3 neighbors, form 1 3-star)
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9 (has 3 neighbors, form 1 3-star)
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 7 (has 4 neighbors, form 4 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [8]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, 3, 8>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <2, 8, 9>
- <3, 7, 8>
