Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: (1, 2, 4)
- Node 1: (0, 3, 5, 7)
- Node 2: (0, 3, 4, 6)
- Node 3: (1, 2, 7)
- Node 4: (0, 2, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 5: (1, 4, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 6: (2, 5, 7)
- Node 7: (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (4, 5, 7)
- Node 9: (7)

Now, we can identify the 3-stars formed in this graph:

- Node 1: <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 5, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars formed based on the given graph, we have a total of [5].
