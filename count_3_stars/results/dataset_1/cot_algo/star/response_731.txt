Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's find the 3-stars present in this graph:

For each node, let's find its neighbors:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 1}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [34] \)

The unique 3-stars present in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (6, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (5, 4, 7)>
