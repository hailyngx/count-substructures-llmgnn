Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0, 3
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 42 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 8, 9)>, 
<0, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<0, (8, 9, 4)>, 
<0, (9, 1, 8)>, 
<1, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 4, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 8, 9)>. 

So, the final answer is [42].
