Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 6}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1, as it has 4 neighbors: [\(^{4}C_{3}\) = 4]
    - <1, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 8)>

- Node 2, as it has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
    - <2, (1, 4, 7)>

- Node 4, as it has 5 neighbors: [\(^{5}C_{3}\) = 10]
    - <4, (0, 2, 7)>
    - <4, (0, 3, 6)>
    - <4, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <4, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <4, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <4, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <4, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <4, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <4, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <4, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 10] = [15]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (3, 4, 7)>.
