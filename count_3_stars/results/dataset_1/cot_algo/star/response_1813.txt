Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 5, and 9 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: \( [4 + 10 + 4] = 18 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 18. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>
