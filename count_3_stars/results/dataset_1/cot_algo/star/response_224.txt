Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {4, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 8}

Now, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 5, Node 8, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
