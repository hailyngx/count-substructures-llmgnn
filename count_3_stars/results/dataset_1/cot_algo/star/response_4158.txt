Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1

Next, let's identify the 3-star graphs:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

In total, there are 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 17 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [17] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 3, 5)>
- <7, (2, 1, 5)>
- <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
