Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (1, 4, 8), so it forms a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (5, 2, 7), so it forms a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (8, 0, 1, 6), so it forms a 3-star.    

The total number of 3-stars is 3, denoted as [3].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<5, (5, 2, 7)>,
<8, (8, 0, 1, 6)>.
