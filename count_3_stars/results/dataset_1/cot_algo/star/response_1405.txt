Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

```
0 -- 3 -- 5 -- 8 -- 1
|           |    |
9           7 -- 2
            |\
            | 4
            6
```

After examining the neighbors for each node, we find that:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 7, 8
- Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 5
- Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4

Nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 20 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [20] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
