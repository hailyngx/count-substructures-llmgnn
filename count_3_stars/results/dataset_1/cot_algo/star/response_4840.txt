Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, a total of 18 3-stars are formed in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>.

So, the final count of unique 3-stars in this graph is [18].
