Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars.
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>

- Node 8 can form 5C3 = 10 3-stars.
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10] = [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
