Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 1

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
