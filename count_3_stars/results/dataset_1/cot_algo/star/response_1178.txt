Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we will first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 8}

Now, let's look at the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and find the 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
    - <1, (2, 4, 5)>
    - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 7)>

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
    - <5, (1, 4, 6)>
    - <5, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <5, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <5, (4, 6, 9)>

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
    - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <6, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (5, 7, 8)>

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
    - <7, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (2, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
    - <8, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <8, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <8, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [26] \)

Therefore, the 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
