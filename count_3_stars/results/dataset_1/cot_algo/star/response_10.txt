Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: \( [1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [24] \)

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
