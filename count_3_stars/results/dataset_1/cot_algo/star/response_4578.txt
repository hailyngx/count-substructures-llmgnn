Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {5, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {0, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-star formations:
- Node 0 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 6 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <6, (0, 4, 2)>
- Node 9 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <9, (7, 8, 2)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 11 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 2)>, <9, (7, 8, 2)>
