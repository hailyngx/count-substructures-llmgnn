Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 6, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 1: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 2: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 4: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 6: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10
- Node 8: [\( \binom{6}{3} \)] = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20] = 34.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 8, 9)>
