Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 2, 4
- Node 9: 2, 4

Now, we can see that nodes 1 and 2 have 4 neighbors each, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 8, which we will represent as [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 2, 8)>
- <1, (5, 2, 9)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 1)>
- <2, (5, 7, 1)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
