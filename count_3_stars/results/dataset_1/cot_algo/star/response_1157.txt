Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {8, 9}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves {2, 4, 6, 8} (4 choose 3 = 4 possibilities)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves {5, 6, 9} (3 choose 3 = 1 possibility)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1] = 5

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
