Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6

Now, let's check for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 1, 9)>
<5, (6, 3, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 1)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 1, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (3, 9, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
