Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5

Now, let's check which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 5, 7
- Node 1: Forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 5
- Node 2: Forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 8, 9
- Node 5: Forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: Forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: Forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 4, 5

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<1, (3, 5)>, 
<2, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 8, 9)>, 
<8, (2, 3, 4, 7)>, 
<9, (2, 4, 5)>.
