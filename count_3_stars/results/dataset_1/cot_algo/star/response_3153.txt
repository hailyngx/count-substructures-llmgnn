Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are nodes 2 and 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are nodes 2, 4, and 6
- Node 2: Neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9
- Node 3: Neighbor is node 7
- Node 4: Neighbors are nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8
- Node 5: Neighbor is node 4
- Node 6: Neighbors are nodes 1, 2, and 4
- Node 7: Neighbor is node 3
- Node 8: Neighbors are nodes 0, 4, and 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are nodes 2, 8

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors.

Next, we'll calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: 1 3-star (<1, 2, 4>)
- Node 2: 1 3-star (<2, 0, 1>)
- Node 4: 1 3-star (<4, 1, 6>)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (<8, 0, 4>)

Total number of 3-stars: 4

The final answer is [4].
