Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 3: {4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (8, 4, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
