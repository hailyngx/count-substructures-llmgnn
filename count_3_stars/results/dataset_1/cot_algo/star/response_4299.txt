Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. We will now calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph.

For node 0: 
- Neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 4: 
- Neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 5: 
- Neighbors: 0, 2, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 7: 
- Neighbors: 0, 3, 4
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 8: 
- Neighbors: 0, 9
- Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 9: 
- Neighbors: 4, 5, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>
