Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbor {8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbor {0}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor {8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars: [1]

And list the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
