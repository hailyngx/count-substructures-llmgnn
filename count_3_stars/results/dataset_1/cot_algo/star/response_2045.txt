Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 30 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
