Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11.

Therefore, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
