Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 8
Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 7
Node 2: 1, 7, 9
Node 3: 1, 8
Node 6: 1, 8
Node 7: 1, 2, 9
Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 9
Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 

Adding them up, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>.
