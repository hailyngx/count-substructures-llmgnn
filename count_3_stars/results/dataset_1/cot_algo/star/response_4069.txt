Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 6)>

Since nodes 1 and 4 each have exactly 3 neighbors and can form a 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
