Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3-stars: <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 1, 3-stars: 
- Node 2, 3-stars:
- Node 3, 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 4, 3-stars:
- Node 5, 3-stars: 
- Node 6, 3-stars:
- Node 7, 3-stars:
- Node 8, 3-stars:
- Node 9, 3-stars: 

Total number of 3-stars: [2]
