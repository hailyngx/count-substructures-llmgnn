Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 7
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0

Next, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Yes (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: Yes (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: No (2 neighbors)
- Node 3: Yes (4 neighbors)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 4)>
