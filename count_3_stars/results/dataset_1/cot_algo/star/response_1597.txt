Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 5} 
- Node 1: Neighbor {7} 
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6} 
- Node 3: Neighbor {9} 
- Node 4: Neighbor {0} 
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 7} 
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 8} 
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5} 
- Node 8: Neighbor {6} 
- Node 9: Neighbor {3}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found in this graph is <0, (2, 4, 5)>.
