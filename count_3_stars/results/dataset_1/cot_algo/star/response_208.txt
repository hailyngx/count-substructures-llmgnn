Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
The nodes have the following neighbors:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 6
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 8: 3, 4

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>.
  
The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7, so the final answer is [7].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>.
