Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 8
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Next, we identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1, 8
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors:
  - Each node with 3 neighbors contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  - Total 3-stars from nodes with 3 neighbors: 3 x 1 = 3

- Nodes with 4 neighbors (1, 8):
  - Each node with 4 neighbors contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Total 3-stars from nodes with 4 neighbors: 2 x 4 = 8

- Nodes with 5 neighbors (4, 6):
  - Each node with 5 neighbors contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - Total 3-stars from nodes with 5 neighbors: 2 x 10 = 20

Adding up all the 3-stars: 3 + 8 + 20 = 31

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
