Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbor {1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}

Now, we check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 10 + 4 + 1] = 19 \).

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 3)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
