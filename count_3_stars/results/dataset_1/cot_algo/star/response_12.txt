Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 4, 9
Node 1: 7, 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 8
Node 3: 2, 4
Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 7
Node 5: 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 5
Node 9: 0, 1, 7

Now, we need to identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 7 all have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18, so we put [18].

Listing out the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
