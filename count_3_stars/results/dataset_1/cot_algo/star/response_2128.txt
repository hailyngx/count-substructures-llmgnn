Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 8: {2, 6}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star

Putting it all together, we have a total of 4 [4] 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7, 8)>, and <6, (4, 8, 9)>.
