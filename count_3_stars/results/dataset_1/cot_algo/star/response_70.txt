Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 8
- Node 7: 4, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 = 6]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
