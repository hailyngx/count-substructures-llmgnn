Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-star configurations in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star configurations 
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star configuration 
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star configuration 
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations 
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star configurations 
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations 

Summing these up:
\[ [10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 30 \]

So, there are 30 3-star configurations in the given graph.

The unique 3-star configurations are: 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
