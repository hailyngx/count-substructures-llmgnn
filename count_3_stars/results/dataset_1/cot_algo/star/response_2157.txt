Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 3
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 6
Node 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 6
Node 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
Node 6 neighbors: 3, 4
Node 9 neighbors: 1, 5

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 9)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 5, 6)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
