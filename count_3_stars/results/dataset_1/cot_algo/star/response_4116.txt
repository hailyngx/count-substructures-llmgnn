Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 3 -- 1
|    |    |
7 -- 8 -- 2
|    |    |
4 -- 9 -- 5
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has neighbors {3, 7, 8}.
- Node 1 has neighbors {3, 8}.
- Node 2 has neighbors {3, 4, 5}.
- Node 3 has neighbors {0, 1, 2, 8}.
- Node 4 has neighbors {2, 7, 9}.
- Node 5 has neighbors {2, 9}.
- Node 7 has neighbors {0, 4, 8}.
- Node 8 has neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7, 9}.
- Node 9 has neighbors {4, 5, 8}.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding them up, we get a total of [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10] = 18 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (3, 8, 1)>
- <0, (3, 8, 2)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (3, 0, 1)>
- <8, (3, 0, 2)>
- <8, (3, 1, 2)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (7, 0, 4)>
- <8, (7, 4, 9)>
