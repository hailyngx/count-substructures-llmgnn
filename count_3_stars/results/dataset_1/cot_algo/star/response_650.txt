Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6 (degree 3)
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 (degree 5)
- Node 3: 2, 4 (degree 2)
- Node 4: 0, 3 (degree 2)
- Node 5: 0, 2 (degree 2)
- Node 6: 1, 2 (degree 2)
- Node 7: 2 (degree 1)
- Node 8: 9 (degree 1)
- Node 9: 0, 8 (degree 2)

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 10] = 14.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
