Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 5, 8, 9
Node 1: 2, 4, 6
Node 2: 0, 1, 8, 9
Node 4: 1, 8
Node 5: 0
Node 6: 1
Node 7: 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 9
Node 9: 0, 2, 7, 8

Now, we can check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 
Node 1: none
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 
Node 4: none
Node 5: none
Node 6: none
Node 7: none
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is: [16]
