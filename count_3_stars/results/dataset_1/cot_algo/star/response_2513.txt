Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:
For Node 0, there are 4 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star.
For Node 1, there are 4 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star.
For Node 3, there are 6 neighbors, so we can form 20 3-stars.
For Node 8, there are 5 neighbors, so we can form 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 32, which we will denote as [32].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (8, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 4)>
<3, (8, 0, 1)>
<3, (8, 1, 5)>
<3, (8, 6, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the given graph.
