Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by examining the neighbors of each node.

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: (3, 5)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (3, 6, 7). There are 1 3-star formed with this node, <1, (3, 6, 7)>.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor: (4)
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (0, 1, 5, 6, 8). There are 10 3-stars formed with this node. They are <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, and <3, (5, 6, 8)>.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (2, 6, 7, 9). There are 4 3-stars formed with this node. They are <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, and <4, (6, 7, 9)>.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: (0, 3)
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (1, 3, 4, 7, 9). There are 10 3-stars formed with this node. They are <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, and <6, (4, 7, 9)>.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (1, 4, 6, 9). There are 4 3-stars formed with this node. They are <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, and <7, (4, 6, 9)>.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: (3)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (4, 6, 7, 9). There are 4 3-stars formed with this node. They are <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, and <9, (6, 7, 9)>.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 33].
