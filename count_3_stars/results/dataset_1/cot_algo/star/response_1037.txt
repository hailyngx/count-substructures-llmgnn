Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 4, 5, 7
Node 1: 5
Node 3: 8
Node 4: 0, 6
Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 9
Node 6: 4, 5, 7
Node 7: 0, 6, 9
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star (0, 4, 5), (0, 5, 7)
Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: (5, 0, 1), (5, 0, 6), (5, 6, 9), (5, 7, 9)
Node 6: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star (6, 4, 5), (6, 5, 7)
Node 7: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star (7, 0, 6), (7, 6, 9)

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7, so the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are <(0, 4, 5)>, <(0, 5, 7)>, <(5, 0, 1)>, <(5, 0, 6)>, <(5, 6, 9)>, <(5, 7, 9)>, <(6, 4, 5)>, <(6, 5, 7)>, <(7, 0, 6)>, <(7, 6, 9)>.
