Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, 6, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each:
  - Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 1 3-star
  - Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  - Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 4 + 1 = 6\)

So, the final result is [6] and the unique 3-stars are: <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>.
