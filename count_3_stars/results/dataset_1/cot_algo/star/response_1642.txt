Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 6}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, 5, 6, and 8 have 4 neighbors each.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all these up:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars, denoted by [], is 54.

The unique 3-stars, denoted by <>, are:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
