Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7, 8

Now let's find the 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 4, 7, 9
- For node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>
