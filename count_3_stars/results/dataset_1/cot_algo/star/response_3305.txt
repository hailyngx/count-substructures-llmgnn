Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {7, 8}
- Node 1: {8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 4}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 7, 8}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- For Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars formed = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>
