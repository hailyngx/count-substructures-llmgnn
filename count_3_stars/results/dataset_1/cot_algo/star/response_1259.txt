Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13, so we have [13].

The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>.
