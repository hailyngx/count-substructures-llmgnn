Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 4, 5, 7.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 3.
- Node 2: Neighbor is 1.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 3.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 3.
- Node 6: Neighbor is 9.
- Node 7: Neighbor is 0.
- Node 8: Neighbor is 3.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 3, 6.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.

For node 0, we can form 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
For node 3, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 = 11. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8, 9)>
