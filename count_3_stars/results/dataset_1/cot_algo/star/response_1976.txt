Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 4: {5}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 7, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [15] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (2, 7, 8)>
