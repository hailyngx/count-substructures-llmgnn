Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 28 \)

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, <5, 6, 7>>, <6, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)> 

So, the answer is: [28].
