Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {1, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 2 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [7]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>.
