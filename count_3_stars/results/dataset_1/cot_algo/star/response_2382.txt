Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the provided information, let's first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1, 8

So, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars using \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes 1 and 8:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
