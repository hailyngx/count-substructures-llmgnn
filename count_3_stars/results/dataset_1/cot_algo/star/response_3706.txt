Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
[11]
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
