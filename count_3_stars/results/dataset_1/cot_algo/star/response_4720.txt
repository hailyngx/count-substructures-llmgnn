Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor = {3}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbor = {5}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {3, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 9, 1}

Thus, there are a total of 2 3-stars in the graph, which gives us the final result: [2].
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 7, 8)> and <3, (5, 9, 1)>.
