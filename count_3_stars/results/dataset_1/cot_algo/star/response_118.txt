Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 8}

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
