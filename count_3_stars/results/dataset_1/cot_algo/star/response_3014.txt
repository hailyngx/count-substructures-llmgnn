Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbor of node 0 is node 1.
- Node 1: Neighbors of node 1 are nodes 0, 3, and 5.
- Node 2: Neighbors of node 2 are nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 3: Neighbors of node 3 are nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 4: Neighbor of node 4 is node 6.
- Node 5: Neighbor of node 5 is node 1.
- Node 6: Neighbor of node 6 is node 4.
- Node 8: Neighbors of node 8 are nodes 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 9: Neighbor of node 9 is node 8.

Next, we will check the nodes that have three or more neighbors and see if they form any 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 9)>

There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [3].
