Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 8}
- Node 5: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, with 4 neighbors, can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3, with 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8, with 5 neighbors, can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9, with 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.

Adding them up: 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 16, so the total number of 3-stars is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
