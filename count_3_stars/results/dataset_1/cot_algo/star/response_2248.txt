Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 0)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1] = 21, and they are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 0)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>
