Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 7 and 8.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 5 and 8.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 2 and 6.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1 and 3.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1 and 4.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0 and 9.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 3, and 9.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in this graph:

- Node 0: Doesn't form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 5, 6). So, <1, (2, 5, 6)>.
- Node 2: Doesn't form any 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors, and we consider this separately.
- Node 3: Doesn't form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: Doesn't form any 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors, and we consider this separately.
- Node 5: Doesn't form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Doesn't form any 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors, and we consider this separately.
- Node 7: Doesn't form any 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors, and we consider this separately.
- Node 8: Doesn't form any 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors, and we consider this separately.
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 7, 8). So, <9, (2, 7, 8)>.

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars formed by nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:

- Node 2: Can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4: Can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6: Can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7: Can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8: Can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 5, 6)> and <9, (2, 7, 8)>.
