Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7, 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 = 14 \)

Therefore, the final result is [14] and the unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (5, 4, 8)>.
