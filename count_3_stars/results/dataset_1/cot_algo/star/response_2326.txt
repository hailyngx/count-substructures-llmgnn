Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 4, 5, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 4 = 24, which we will represent as [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the graph.
