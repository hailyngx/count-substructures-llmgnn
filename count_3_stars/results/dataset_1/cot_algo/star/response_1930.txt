Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 4 and 8
- Node 1: No neighbors
- Node 2: Neighbors are 3 and 7
- Node 3: Neighbors are 2, 5, 6, and 8
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 8, and 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 3, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 3 and 5
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, and 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 4, 5, and 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 3 and Node 5 both have 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of them.
The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [8], and the unique 3-stars are <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 5)>, <3, (2, 7, 5)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 6)>, <5, (6, 3, 7)>, <5, (7, 3, 6)>.
