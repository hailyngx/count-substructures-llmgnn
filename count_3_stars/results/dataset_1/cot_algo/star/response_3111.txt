Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 7}
- Node 9: {1}

Now we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars:
  - <3, (0, 2, 4)>
  - <3, (0, 2, 5)>
  - <3, (0, 2, 6)>
  - <3, (0, 2, 8)>
  - <3, (0, 3, 4)>
  - <3, (0, 3, 5)>
  - <3, (0, 3, 6)>
  - <3, (0, 3, 8)>
  - <3, (0, 4, 5)>
  - <3, (0, 4, 6)>
  - <3, (0, 4, 8)>
  - <3, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <3, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <3, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <3, (2, 4, 5)>
  - <3, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <3, (2, 4, 8)>
  - <3, (2, 5, 6)>
  - <3, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <3, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 20] = 22.
