Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 4, 9 have 5 neighbors (forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each)
- Node 2, 8 have 3 neighbors (forming \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each)
- Node 3, 5, 7 have 3 neighbors but will not form any 3-stars as they don't have at least 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 9) + 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 8) = 32

So, the final answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 4)>
