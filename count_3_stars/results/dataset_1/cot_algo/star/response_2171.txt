Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars is 1+20+1+1+4+4 = 31. So, the final answer is [31].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
