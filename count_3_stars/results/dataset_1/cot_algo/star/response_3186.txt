Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}

Now let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
  <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, 
  <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 7 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>

Adding them up:  
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 = 40.

Therefore, the final result is [40].
