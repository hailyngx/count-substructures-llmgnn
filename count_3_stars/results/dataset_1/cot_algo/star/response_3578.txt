Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 3, 4).
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 3, 5) and another 3-star with nodes (1, 5, 9).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3 [1 for node 1 and 2 for node 4], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5), (1, 5, 9)>.
