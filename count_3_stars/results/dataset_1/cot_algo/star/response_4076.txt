Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find all the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 4, 6, 8, and 3 have 6, 4, 4, 3, and 3 neighbors respectively.

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [20 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [29]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (9, 3, 0)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
