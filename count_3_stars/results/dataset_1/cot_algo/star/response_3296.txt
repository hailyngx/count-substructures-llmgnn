Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the 3-star graph in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {4}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0}

Next, we check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0 and Node 6 have 2 neighbors, so we do not consider them further.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so we do not consider it further.
- Node 9, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 7 have 1 neighbor, so we do not consider them further.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so we do not consider it further.

Therefore, no 3-stars can be formed in this graph.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [0].
