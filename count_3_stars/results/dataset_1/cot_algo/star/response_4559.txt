Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1}
Node 1: {0, 8, 9}
Node 2: {6, 9}
Node 3: {5, 7}
Node 4: {9}
Node 5: {3, 9}
Node 6: {2}
Node 7: {3, 8, 9}
Node 8: {1, 7, 9}
Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 20 = 22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
