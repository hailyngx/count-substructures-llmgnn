Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6, 7}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4 + 4 = 18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <7, (0, 6, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
