Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1, 5, 8
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are 5 3-stars in total:

\[ [5] \]

And the unique 3-stars are:

- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
