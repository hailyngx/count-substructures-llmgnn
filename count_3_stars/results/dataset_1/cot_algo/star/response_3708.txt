Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors are 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: neighbors are 7
- Node 4: neighbors are 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 4, 7
- Node 6: neighbors are 0, 8
- Node 7: neighbors are 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: neighbors are 6, 7
- Node 9: neighbor is 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8, which we'll represent as [8].

List of unique 3-stars found:
<0, 2, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 0>
<5, 7, 2>
<7, 8, 2>
<7, 8, 5>
<7, 8, 4>
<7, 8, 3>
