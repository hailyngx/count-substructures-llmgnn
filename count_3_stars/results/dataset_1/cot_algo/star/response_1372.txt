Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 4, 8, 9
Node 1: 7, 8
Node 2: 5, 7
Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 4: 0, 3, 7, 9
Node 5: 2, 3, 6
Node 6: 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 1, 6
Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 7: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10] = 43.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>
