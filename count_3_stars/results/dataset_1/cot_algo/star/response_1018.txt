Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 7}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 7}

Next, we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: Not applicable (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: Not applicable (2 neighbors)
- Node 3: Not applicable (1 neighbor)
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5: Not applicable (2 neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7

Hence, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-star formations are:
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
