Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 9}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 4, and 9.
Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 5, and 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>.
