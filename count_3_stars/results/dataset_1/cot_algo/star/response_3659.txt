Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 5, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 4, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>.
