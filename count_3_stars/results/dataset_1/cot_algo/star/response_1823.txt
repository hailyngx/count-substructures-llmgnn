Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1: No 3-stars, as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: It has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>.
- Node 3: It has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>.
- Node 5: It has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>.
- Node 6: No 3-stars, as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: No 3-stars, as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 12, and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>.
