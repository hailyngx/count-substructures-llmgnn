Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 5}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {2}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 
\[ [10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4] = [58] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>.
