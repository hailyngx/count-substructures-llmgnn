Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [23] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (7, 9, 3)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
