Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
        
        - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3.
        - Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7.
        - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8.
        - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 8.
        - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 9.
        - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8.
        - Node 6 is connected to node 7.
        - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6.
        - Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5.
        - Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Let's analyze the neighbors of each node:
        
        - Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
        - Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
        - Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
        - Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
        - Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
        - Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
        - Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
        - Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
        - Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
        - Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

        Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
        Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
        Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
        Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
        Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
        Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
        Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

        <3, (0, 5, 8)>
        <3, (0, 7, 8)>
        <3, (5, 7, 8)>
        <3, (0, 3, 8)>
        <3, (0, 3, 5)>
        <3, (2, 4, 5)>
        <4, (1, 2, 9)>
        <5, (2, 3, 8)>
        <7, (1, 3, 7)>
