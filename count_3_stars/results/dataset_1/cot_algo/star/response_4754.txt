Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graph formed in this case is as follows:

Sum of total 3-stars: [8]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
