Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are as follows: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 5}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: 0 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1 3-star <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4: 1 3-star <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 5: 0 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [2]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>
