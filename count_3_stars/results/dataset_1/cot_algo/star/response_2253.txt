Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbor {8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbor {9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star: <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, and they are:
\[<3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)> \]
