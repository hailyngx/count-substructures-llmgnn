Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 4}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>
