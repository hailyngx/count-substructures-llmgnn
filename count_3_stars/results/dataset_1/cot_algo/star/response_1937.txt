Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20 (20 unique 3-stars)
- Node 3: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 (10 unique 3-stars)
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 (10 unique 3-stars)
- Node 7: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10] = 42

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
