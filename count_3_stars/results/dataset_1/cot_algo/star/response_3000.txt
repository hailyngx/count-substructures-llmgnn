Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 3 and 6
- Node 1: Neighbors are 5, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 6, and 7
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 3, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 3, 5, and 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 4, 6, and 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5, and 6

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48], and the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 4)>, <1, (5, 8, 4)>,
<3, (0, 6, 5)>, <3, (7, 5, 6)>, <3, (7, 5, 4)>, <3, (7, 4, 6)>,
<3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 4)>, <3, (7, 5, 8)>,
<3, (7, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>,
<4, (3, 9, 6)>, <4, (9, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (9, 5, 3)>,
<5, (6, 9, 3)>, <5, (6, 9, 1)>, <5, (6, 4, 9)>, <5, (6, 4, 1)>,
<5, (6, 4, 3)>
