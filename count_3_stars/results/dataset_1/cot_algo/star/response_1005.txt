Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph as an adjacency list:

Node 0: 4, 6
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 1, 3
Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 7
Node 4: 0, 3, 9
Node 5: 8
Node 6: 0, 3, 9
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 5
Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 7), so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. These 3-stars are <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, and <3, (4, 6, 7)>.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 9), so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star. This 3-star is <4, (0, 3, 9)>.
Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 9), so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star. This 3-star is <6, (0, 3, 9)>.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, and <6, (0, 3, 9)>.
