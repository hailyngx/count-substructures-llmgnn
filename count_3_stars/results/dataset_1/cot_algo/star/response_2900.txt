Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 5)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 7, 9)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (node 8)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 8, 9)
- Node 4: 1 neighbor (node 6)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (nodes 0, 6)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 7)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (nodes 1, 6)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (nodes 2, 3)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (nodes 1, 3)

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 7, and 9. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 8, and 9. <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 5, and 7. <6, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
