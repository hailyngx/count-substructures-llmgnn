Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [11] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
