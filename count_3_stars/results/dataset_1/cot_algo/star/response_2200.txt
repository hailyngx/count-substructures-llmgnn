Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8

Next, we identify which nodes have three or more neighbors and count the total number of 3-stars:

From the neighbor sets:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 9) = 18
So, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (4, 8, 3)>
- <9, (4, 8, 7)>
- <9, (4, 8, 2)>
