Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 7}

Next, we need to identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars. In this case, nodes 3, 5, and 9 have 5, 4, and 3 neighbors respectively. 

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 4 + 1] = [15] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
