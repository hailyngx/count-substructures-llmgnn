Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, here is the analysis to find the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 3, 6
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 8
3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 9
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8
5. Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 7
6. Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 1, 9
7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3
8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 8
9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7
10. Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 and Node 4 have less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
Node 1, Node 3, Node 7, and Node 8 have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
Therefore, there are \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \) 3-stars in the graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets, we get the total number of 3-stars as [16]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 8, 7)>
<3, (8, 0, 6)>
<7, (8, 1, 4)>
<8, (7, 2, 4)>
