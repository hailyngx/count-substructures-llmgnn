Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Each node with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form a 3-star.
- Sum of \( inom{n}{3} \) for each such node:
  - \( inom{4}{3} \) for Node 0 = 4
  - \( inom{4}{3} \) for Node 1 = 4
  - \( inom{4}{3} \) for Node 3 = 4
  - \( inom{5}{3} \) for Node 4 = 10
  - \( inom{4}{3} \) for Node 8 = 4
  
Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26

There are 26 total 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
