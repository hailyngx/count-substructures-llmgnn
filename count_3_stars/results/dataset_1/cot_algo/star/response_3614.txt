Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 17 \]

So, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in the graph. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 9, 3)>, <3, (6, 0, 8)>, <3, (8, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 4)>, <8, (7, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 3)>, <8, (5, 3, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 8)>
