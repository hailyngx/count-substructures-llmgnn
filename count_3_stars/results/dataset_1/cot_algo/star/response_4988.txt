Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 7
- Node 1: 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 7
- Node 9: 4

Now, we can identify the 3-stars formed by nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
   <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
   <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
   <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [11].
