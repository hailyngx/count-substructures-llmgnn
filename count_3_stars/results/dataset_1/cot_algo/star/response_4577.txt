Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 1 neighbors: 3, 7
Node 2 neighbors: 3, 6, 8
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 6
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 8, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 0
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3
Node 7 neighbors: 1, 8, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7
Node 9 neighbors: 4, 7

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 8, and Node 7 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [12] \)

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
