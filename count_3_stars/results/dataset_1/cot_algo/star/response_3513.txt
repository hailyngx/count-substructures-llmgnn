Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graph for the given graph is as follows:

Total number of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
