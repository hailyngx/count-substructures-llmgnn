Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
