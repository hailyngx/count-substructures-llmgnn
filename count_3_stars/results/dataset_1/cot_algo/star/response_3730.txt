Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 1, 2
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>.
