Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {0, 5}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {0}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2 of which are already connected), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1] = [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
