Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

For each of the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed.
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [23] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>
