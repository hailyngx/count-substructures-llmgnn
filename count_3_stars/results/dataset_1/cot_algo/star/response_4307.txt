Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6}

Nodes 0, 1, and 2 each have 3 neighbors, so they form 3-stars:
[3]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
