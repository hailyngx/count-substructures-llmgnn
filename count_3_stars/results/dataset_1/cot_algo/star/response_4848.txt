Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
Node 0 and Node 6 both have 6 neighbors, so they each form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
The total number of 3-stars is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) [40].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
