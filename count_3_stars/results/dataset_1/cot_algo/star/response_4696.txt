Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 7}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors which can form 3-stars. These nodes are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (only 1 3-star)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the final result is [18] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 4, 6)>
- <1, (5, 4, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <3, (6, 5, 4)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 7)>
