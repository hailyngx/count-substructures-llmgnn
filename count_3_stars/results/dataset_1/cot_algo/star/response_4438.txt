Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph by first finding the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {2, 4, 7}
Node 1 neighbors: {4, 9}
Node 2 neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 9}
Node 3 neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 9}
Node 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
Node 5 neighbors: {3, 6}
Node 6 neighbors: {5}
Node 7 neighbors: {0, 4, 8, 9}
Node 8 neighbors: {7}
Node 9 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 7}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 0: has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 2: has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>.
