Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: {6}
Node 1: {5, 9}
Node 2: {4, 5, 6}
Node 4: {2, 7}
Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 8}
Node 6: {0, 2, 5}
Node 7: {4, 9}
Node 8: {5, 9}
Node 9: {1, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 1 has 2 neighbor nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbor nodes, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbor nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbor nodes, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbor nodes, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 2 neighbor nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 8 has 2 neighbor nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbor nodes, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7, so we write [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
