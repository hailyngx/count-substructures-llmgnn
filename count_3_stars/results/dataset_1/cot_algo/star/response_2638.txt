Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {1, 6}
- Node 1 neighbors: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 2 neighbors: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 3 neighbors: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5 neighbors: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 6 neighbors: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 7 neighbors: {1, 9}
- Node 8 neighbors: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 9 neighbors: {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}

Now, we will check for nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 7}. Thus, <1, (4, 7)>.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 6, 8}. Thus, <3, (4, 6, 8)>.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 6}. Thus, <4, (5, 6)>.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 8}. Thus, <9, (7, 8)>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [4]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (4, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6)>, <9, (7, 8)>.
