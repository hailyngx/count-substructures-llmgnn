Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of those nodes:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 10 = 12]

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
