Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbor {7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4+1] = 5.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
