Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {4}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {0}
- Node 7: neighbors {5}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 2}

Next, we'll check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
