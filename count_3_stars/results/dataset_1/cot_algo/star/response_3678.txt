Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 8
Node 1: 0, 7
Node 2: 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 4, 5
Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 5: 3, 4, 6
Node 6: 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 9: 2, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Since each of these 3-stars is unique, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 32.

Therefore, the final answer is [32].
