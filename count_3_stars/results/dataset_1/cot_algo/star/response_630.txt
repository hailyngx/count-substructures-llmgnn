Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 6, 8}

Nodes 0, 5, and 8 have 5, 5, and 6 neighbors respectively, so they can form 10, 10, and 20 3-stars, respectively. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 10 + 20 = 40]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
