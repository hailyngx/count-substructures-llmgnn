Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {4, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

For node 0: 
- Neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>

For node 3: 
- Neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>

For node 5: 
- Neighbors: 3, 6, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9. Hence, the final answer is [9].
