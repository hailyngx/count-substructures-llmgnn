Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 7), (5, 8), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 5), (9, 1), (9, 6)]

Now, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- No other node has 3 or more neighbors, so no other 3-stars are formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20], and the unique 3-star found is <1, (2, 4, 7)>.
