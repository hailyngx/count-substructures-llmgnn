Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, 1 have 3 neighbors and can form 1 3-star each.
- Node 4, 8, 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 10 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 8) + 10 (from node 9) = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
