Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- For Node 1: inom(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 4: inom(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 9: inom(4, 3) = 4

Total 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (6, 7, 9)>
