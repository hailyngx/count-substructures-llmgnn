Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's map out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5}
- Node 9: {3, 6}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (3, 9, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
