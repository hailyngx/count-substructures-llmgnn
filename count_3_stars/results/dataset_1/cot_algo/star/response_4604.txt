Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 66

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 66. 

Unique 3-stars found:
1. <1, (0, 7, 9)>
2. <6, (0, 4, 8)>
3. <7, (0, 5, 9)>
4. <7, (1, 5, 6)>
5. <9, (1, 4, 8)>
