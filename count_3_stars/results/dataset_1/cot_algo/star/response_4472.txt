Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 2, 3

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Nodes 2, 3, and 6 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>.
