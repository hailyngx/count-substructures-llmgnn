Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we'll determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 6 neighbors - Forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors - Forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 neighbors - Forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 2 neighbors - Not enough neighbors

Total 3-stars: [20 + 4 + 4] = 28

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
