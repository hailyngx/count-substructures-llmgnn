Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 7}

Now, we will check for each node if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes {6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: Forms 4 3-stars: {1, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 9}, {1, 4, 9}, {2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: Does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
