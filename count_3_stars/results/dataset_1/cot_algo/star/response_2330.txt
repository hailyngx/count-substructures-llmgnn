Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 7, 9}, resulting in <2, (4, 7, 9)>. Apply \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars branching off from Node 2.
- Node 3 has exactly 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars in total: <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {6, 8, 9}, resulting in <4, (6, 8, 9)>. Apply \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars branching off from Node 4.
- Node 6 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star in total: <6, (8, 9, 4)>.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {3, 4, 6}, resulting in <8, (3, 4, 6)>. Apply \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star branching off from Node 8.
- Node 9 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star in total: <9, (2, 3, 6)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars identified, we have a total of [4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [21] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (8, 9, 4)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
