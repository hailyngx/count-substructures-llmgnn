Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-star graph can be analyzed as follows:

Node 0 has neighbors: {7, 8, 9}
Node 1 has neighbors: {2}
Node 2 has neighbors: {1, 3, 8, 9}
Node 3 has neighbors: {2, 6}
Node 5 has neighbors: {6, 7, 8}
Node 6 has neighbors: {3, 5, 9}
Node 7 has neighbors: {0, 5}
Node 8 has neighbors: {0, 2, 5}
Node 9 has neighbors: {0, 2, 6}

Calculating the number of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors for each node:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (8, 2, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
