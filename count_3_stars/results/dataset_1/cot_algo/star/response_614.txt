Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 2, 3)>.
