Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 5}
- Node 9: {0}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 30

So, the final answer is [30] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>
