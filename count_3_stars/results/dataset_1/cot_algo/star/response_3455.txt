Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 8}

Nodes 0, 6, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using those nodes.

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed. 
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Adding these up, we have a total of 12 possible 3-stars: [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 8, 9)>
