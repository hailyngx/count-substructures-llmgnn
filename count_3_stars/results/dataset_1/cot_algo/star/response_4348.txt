Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7: 3, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 6.
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 5.

Therefore, there are 2 3-stars in this graph, which gives us a total of [2]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 6)> and <2, (3, 4, 5)>.
