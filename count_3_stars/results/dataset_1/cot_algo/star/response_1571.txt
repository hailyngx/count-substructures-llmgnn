Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor nodes {1}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes {2, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes {3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes {6}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes {1, 2, 3, 6}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {2, 8, 9} and {3, 8, 9}.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 8, 9}.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, and <6, (5, 8, 9)>.
