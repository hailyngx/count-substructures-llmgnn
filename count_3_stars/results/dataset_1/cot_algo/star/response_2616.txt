Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5

Next, let's check the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 ways to form 3-stars.
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 ways to form 3-stars.
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 ways to form 3-stars.
- Node 5: has 6 neighbors, so there are [inom{6}{3}] = 20 ways to form 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 32

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 2, 3, 5>
- <3, 4, 5, 6>
- <4, 1, 2, 9>
- <5, 0, 1, 9>
- <5, 0, 3, 9>
- <5, 1, 4, 6>
- <5, 1, 4, 9>
- <5, 1, 9, 0>
- <5, 1, 9, 3>
- <5, 3, 0, 6>
- <5, 3, 0, 9>
- <5, 3, 4, 0>
- <5, 3, 4, 9>
- <5, 3, 6, 0>
- <5, 4, 1, 9>
- <5, 4, 3, 0>
- <5, 4, 3, 9>
- <5, 6, 3, 7>
- <5, 9, 0, 4>
- <5, 9, 1, 0>
- <5, 9, 1, 4>
- <5, 9, 1, 3>
- <5, 9, 3, 0>
- <5, 9, 3, 4>
- <5, 9, 4, 1>
- <5, 9, 4, 3> 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are listed above.
