Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-stars formed by the given graph. 

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 2)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
