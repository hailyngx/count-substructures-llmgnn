Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2}
- Node 4: {0, 1}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 6}
- Node 9: {2}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars, we get a total of [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
