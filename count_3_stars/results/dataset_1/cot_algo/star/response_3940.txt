Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. 
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [22] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
