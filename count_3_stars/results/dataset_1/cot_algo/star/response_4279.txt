Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, and 7 have 4 or more neighbors. So, they can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, and <7, (0, 4, 5)>.
