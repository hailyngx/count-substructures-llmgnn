Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {5, 7}
Node 1: {2, 3, 7, 9}
Node 2: {1, 3, 7, 9}
Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 8}
Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
Node 6: {7, 9}
Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
Node 8: {3, 7}
Node 9: {1, 2, 6}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32] and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>
