Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 22.

Therefore, the final answer is [22], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>
