Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 8

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 = 11.

Therefore, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
