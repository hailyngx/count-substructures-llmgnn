Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbor nodes {7}
- Node 1: neighbor nodes {6}
- Node 2: neighbor nodes {4}
- Node 3: neighbor nodes {4, 5}
- Node 4: neighbor nodes {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: neighbor nodes {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbor nodes {1, 4, 9}
- Node 7: neighbor nodes {0, 4, 9}
- Node 8: neighbor nodes {4, 5}
- Node 9: neighbor nodes {5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 27 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
