Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0, 6

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in this graph.
