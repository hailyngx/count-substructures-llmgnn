Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {2, 8}
- Node 5: {7, 8}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves {8, 9}.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves {4, 6, 7}.
- Node 7 forms two 3-stars: one with leaves {0, 2, 3} and another with leaves {5, 9, 1}.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves {4, 5, 1}.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 ([])

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (4, 5, 1)>
