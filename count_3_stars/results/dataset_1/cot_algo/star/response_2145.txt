Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 4, 5

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Total 3-stars: 5

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
