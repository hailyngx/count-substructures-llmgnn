Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will follow the steps mentioned:

1. Explore neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {2, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {2, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 8}

2. Apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Thus, the final result is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>
