Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {7}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {2}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, 3, 5>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <7, 5, 9>
