Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 6, 8}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10, which we will represent as [10].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<2, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 0)>
