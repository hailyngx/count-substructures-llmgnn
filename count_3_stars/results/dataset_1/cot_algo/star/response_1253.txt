Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 stars: <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 has 1 star: <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 4 has 1 star: <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 has 1 star: <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 has 1 star: <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars [] is 6.
