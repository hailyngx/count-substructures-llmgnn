Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 4

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star: <8, (4, 6, 7)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>.
