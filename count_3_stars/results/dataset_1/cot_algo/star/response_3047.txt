Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 1 neighbor (node 8)
2. Node 1 has 1 neighbor (node 2)
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 5, 7)
4. Node 3 has 1 neighbor (node 2)
5. Node 4 has 2 neighbors (nodes 6, 8)
6. Node 5 has 1 neighbor (node 2)
7. Node 6 has 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 8, 9)
8. Node 7 has 1 neighbor (node 2)
9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 4, 6, 9)
10. Node 9 has 1 neighbor (node 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 8 have 4 neighbors each, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 also has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 1] = [9] \), and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>.
