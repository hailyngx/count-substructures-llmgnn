Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8}

Nodes 0, 2, 7 do not have at least 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars. Nodes 1, 8, and 9 have exactly 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 3-star. Nodes 3, 4, and 5 have more than 3 neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

For node 3:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4

For node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4

For node 5:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1

Adding up all the 3-stars:
1 (from node 1)
1 (from node 8)
1 (from node 9)
4 (from node 3)
4 (from node 4)
1 (from node 5)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (5, 8, 9)>
<(1, 4, 8), (3, 4, 5)>
<(3, 4, 8), (1, 4, 5)>
<(3, 4, 5), (1, 4, 8)>
