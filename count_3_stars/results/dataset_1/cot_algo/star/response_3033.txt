Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 7}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5}

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the 3-stars from each node: 
\[ [10 + 1] = [11] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
