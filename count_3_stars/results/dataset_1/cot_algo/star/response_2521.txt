Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 1] = 3 \)

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 7, 9>
- <3, 2, 7, 9>
- <4, 1, 2, 8>
