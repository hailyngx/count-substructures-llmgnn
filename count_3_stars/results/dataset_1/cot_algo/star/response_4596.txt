Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 19, which can be represented as [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 2, 7)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (7, 9, 0)>
- <8, (2, 9, 4)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 8, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
