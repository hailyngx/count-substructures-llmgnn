Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (4, 7, 8)> (since it only has 4 neighbors)
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 6, so [6].
