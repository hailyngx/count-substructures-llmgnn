Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11], and they are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>
