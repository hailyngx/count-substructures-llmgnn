Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 5, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 3, 6
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 6
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6

From the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors. Let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32

So, the final calculation is [32] with the unique 3-stars being:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
