Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 3}

Now, let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 0 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 1 neighbor
- Node 4: 1 neighbor
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Since only node 6 has 3 or more neighbors, we need to calculate how many 3-stars are formed with node 6:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <6, (0, 2, 5)>.
