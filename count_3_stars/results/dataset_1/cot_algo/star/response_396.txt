Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 6: neighbors {3}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 3, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 2}

Now, let's check for each node how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
