Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list for better visualization:

Node 0: 3, 4, 9
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 1, 6, 7
Node 3: 0
Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 4, 7
Node 6: 2, 4, 7
Node 7: 2, 5, 6
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 0, 4

Now, let's list the neighbor sets for each node:
Node 0: {3, 4, 9}
Node 1: {2}
Node 2: {1, 6, 7}
Node 3: {0}
Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 5: {4, 7}
Node 6: {2, 4, 7}
Node 7: {2, 5, 6}
Node 8: {4}
Node 9: {0, 4}

Nodes 4, 6, and 7 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 = 12

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
