Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, and 9: <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, and 4: <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, and 3: <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars formed: [3]
