Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 5, and 2 have 5, 4, and 5 neighbors respectively, so they can form \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\), \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\), and \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars.
- The total number of 3-stars is \(10 + 4 + 10 = 24\), so [24].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
