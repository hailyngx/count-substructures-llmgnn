Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars involving node 2.
- Node 4 also has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star involving node 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 21, which we will represent as [21].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>
