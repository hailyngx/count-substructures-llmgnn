Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges.

Now, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {7, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 1: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 2: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 5: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 9: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4] = 6

Unique 3-stars found:
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <7, (5, 1, 9)>
- <7, (5, 2, 9)>
