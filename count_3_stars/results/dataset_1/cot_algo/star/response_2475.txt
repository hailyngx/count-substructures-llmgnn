Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 7}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 and 4 both have 4 neighbors, so they each contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 also has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 20 = 34 \) [34]

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (2, 3, 4)>
- <7, (2, 3, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (3, 4, 5)>
