Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 6: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8, represented as [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
