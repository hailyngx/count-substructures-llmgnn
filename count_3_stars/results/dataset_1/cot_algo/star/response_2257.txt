Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 6}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {2, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star <1, (4, 7, 9)>.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star <3, (0, 7, 8)>.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star <7, (1, 3, 8)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], which are <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, and <7, (1, 3, 8)>.
