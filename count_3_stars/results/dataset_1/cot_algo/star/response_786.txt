Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor of 5
- Node 2: Neighbors of 3, 7
- Node 3: Neighbors of 2, 7
- Node 5: Neighbor of 0
- Node 7: Neighbors of 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: Neighbor of 7

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form one 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1] and the unique 3-star found is <7, (2, 3, 9)>.
