Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 6
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 4
- Node 2: Neighbor is 6
- Node 3: Neighbor is 5
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 6, 9
- Node 5: Neighbor is 3
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 4, 6

Now, we can list out the 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 1: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 2: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 3: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 4: One 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 5: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 6: Two 3-stars: <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 9: One 3-star: <9, (4, 6, 6)>

Since we found a total of 4 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [4].
