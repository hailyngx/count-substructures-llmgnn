Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 and Node 3 each have 6 neighbors.
- Node 2, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8 each have 5 neighbors.

We will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1 and Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars for each.
- For Node 2, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each.

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 80 \)

Inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars is [80].

Listing out the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 6, 3)>
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 2, 3)>
- <1, (5, 2, 8)>
- <1, (6, 3, 7)>
- <1, (6, 3, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <3, (6, 2, 7)>
- <3, (6, 2, 8)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (1, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (7, 6, 9)>
