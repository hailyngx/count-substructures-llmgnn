Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 7) = 9
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>
