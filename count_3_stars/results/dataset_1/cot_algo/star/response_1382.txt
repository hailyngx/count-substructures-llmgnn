Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6}

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>
