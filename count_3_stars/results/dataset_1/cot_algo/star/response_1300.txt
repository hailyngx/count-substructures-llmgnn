Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 3
Node 1: 4, 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 6
Node 3: 0
Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 2, 4, 7
Node 7: 1, 4, 6
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 4

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 10 + 1] = 16

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (7, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 5)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (6, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 2, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 1, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 4)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
