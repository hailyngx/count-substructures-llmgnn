Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 16.

So, the final answer is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>,
<2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>,
<6, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>,
<7, (3, 6, 9)>.
