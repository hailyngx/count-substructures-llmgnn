Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1, 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4, 7 neighbors, so \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 35 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [43], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
