Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 8
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 6

Next, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: \<0, (2, 3, 5)\>, \<0, (2, 3, 9)\>, \<0, (2, 5, 9)\>, \<0, (3, 5, 9)\>
- Node 3: \<3, (0, 2, 5)\>, \<3, (0, 2, 8)\>, \<3, (0, 5, 8)\>
- Node 4: \<4, (8, 9, 6)\>, \<4, (8, 9, 7)\>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10] 3-stars.
