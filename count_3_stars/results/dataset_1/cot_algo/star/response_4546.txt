Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
From the neighbor sets, nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors. So, we need to calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<1, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<5, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<6, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<6, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<6, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<6, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<6, (4, 6, 9)>.
