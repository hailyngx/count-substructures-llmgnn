Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {3, 4}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {0, 2}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, and 8 have 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 and 4 have 4 neighbors.

For nodes with 3 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars as \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) for each node. So, we have 3 3-stars.

For nodes with 4 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars as \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) for each node. So, we have 8 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 3 + 8 = 11

So, the final answer is [11] with the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
