Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- For node 0: There are 4 neighbors, so we have [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 2: There are 4 neighbors, so we have [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 3: There are 3 neighbors, so there's 1 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 4: There are 3 neighbors, so there's 1 3-star: <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 7: There are 4 neighbors, so we have [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 9: There are 4 neighbors, so we have [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>

Putting all the 3-stars together, we have:
[21]
<0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 7)>,
<4, (2, 6, 7)>,
<7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>,
<9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>
