Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
     0 -- 3 -- 5
     |    |    |
     4 -- 1 -- 7 -- 2
           |    |    
           6 -- 9 -- 8
```

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4, 8} => inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star with central node 0: <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7} => inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars formed
3. Node 2: Neighbors {7} => Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
4. Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5} => Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
5. Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 6} => inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star with central node 4: <4, (0, 1, 6)>
6. Node 5: Neighbors {3, 7} => Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
7. Node 6: Neighbors {4, 9} => Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
8. Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 8, 9} => inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with central node 7: <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>
9. Node 8: Neighbors {0, 7, 9} => inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star with central node 8: <8, (0, 7, 9)>
10. Node 9: Neighbors {6, 7, 8} => inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star with central node 9: <9, (6, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1] = 13.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>
