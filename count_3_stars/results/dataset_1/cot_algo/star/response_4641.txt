Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 2, 4>
- <9, 2, 5, 7>

Thus, the final answer is [2].
