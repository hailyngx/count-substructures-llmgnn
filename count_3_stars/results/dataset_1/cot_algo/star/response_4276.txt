Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 21 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 21, which can be represented as [21].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
