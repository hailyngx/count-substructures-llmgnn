Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 2, 5}: <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 5, 6}: <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes {6, 8}: <9, (6, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, which we represent as [3].
