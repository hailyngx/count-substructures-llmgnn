Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighboring nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6, 7}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (5, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
