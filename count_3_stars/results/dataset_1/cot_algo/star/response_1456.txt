Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
