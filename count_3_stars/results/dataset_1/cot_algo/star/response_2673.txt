Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 4, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 3 (2 neighbors)
- Node 5: 1, 6 (2 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: 7 (1 neighbor)
- Node 9: 3, 7 (2 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: Not considered as it has only 3 neighbors
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 = 8

The unique 3-stars are: 
1. <0, (1, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
3. <0, (6, 7, 1)>
4. <0, (6, 7, 4)>
5. <1, (0, 5, 7)>
6. <1, (5, 7, 0)>
7. <7, (0, 8, 9)>
8. <7, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed is [8].
