Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 8)
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 different 3-stars. The unique ones are: (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 7), (2, 6, 7), (2, 7, 8), (2, 6, 8)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. (5, 6, 9)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. (7, 6, 8)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. (8, 7, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2 (from node 1) + 20 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) = 25, which we represent as [25].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (7, 6, 9)>.
