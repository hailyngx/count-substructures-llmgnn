Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6.

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: It has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 8, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 2: It has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>

For node 3: It has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>

For node 5: It has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 7, 8), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22. So, the answer is [22].
