Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars and the unique 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {4, 7, 8} -> 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {2, 6, 9} -> 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {1, 6, 8} -> 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
