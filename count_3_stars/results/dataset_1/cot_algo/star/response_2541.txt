Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 9
- Node 1: 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors => [1]
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors => [1]
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors => [1]
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors => [1]
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) => [10]
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) => [10]

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 24

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <5, 8, 9>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <4, 5, 9>
