Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 5 neighbors
- Node 1: has 6 neighbors
- Node 5: has 5 neighbors
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 48\]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is 48, and they are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>
