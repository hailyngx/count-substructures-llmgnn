Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Since we have 10 nodes and 32 edges, this represents an undirected graph. To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the neighbors of each node.

The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 4}

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each such node.

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, there are a total of 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 28 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [28] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>
