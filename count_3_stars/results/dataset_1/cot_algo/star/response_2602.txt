Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes (2, 3, 5) and with nodes (3, 5, 6).
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes (7, 8, 9).

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us:
- Total number of 3-stars: [3]
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
