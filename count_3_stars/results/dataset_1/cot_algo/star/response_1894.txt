Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 9
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is [5].
