Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 34, which can be represented as [34].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
