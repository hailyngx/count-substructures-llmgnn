Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <5, (2, 0, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (2, 1, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <6, (9, 0, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
