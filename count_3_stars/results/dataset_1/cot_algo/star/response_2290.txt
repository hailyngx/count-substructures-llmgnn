Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 2, node 4, node 5, node 6, node 9, and node 0. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2:
It has 3 neighbors: {3, 4, 5}
So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 2 is 1. 

For node 4:
It has 4 neighbors: {2, 6, 9, 2}
So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 4 is \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \). 

For node 5:
It has 3 neighbors: {0, 2, 9}
So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 5 is 1. 

For node 6:
It has 1 neighbor: {4}
As it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed with node 6. 

For node 9:
It has 5 neighbors: {4, 5, 7, 8, 4}
So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 9 is \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \). 

For node 0:
It has 1 neighbor: {5}
As it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed with node 0. 

Adding all the 3-stars together: 
1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 9) = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
