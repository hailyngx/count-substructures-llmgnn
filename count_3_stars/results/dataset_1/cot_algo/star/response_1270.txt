Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 5

Now, we have:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60

So, the total number of 3-stars is [60].

Unique 3-stars:
