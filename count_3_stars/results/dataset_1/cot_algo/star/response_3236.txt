Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: 2, 5, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 7: 1, 8 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 4, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: 5 (1 neighbor)

Now, we need to find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6. <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2 forms three 3-stars:
  - With nodes 0, 1, and 4. <2, (0, 1, 4)>
  - With nodes 0, 4, and 5. <2, (0, 4, 5)>
  - With nodes 1, 4, and 5. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 8. <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms two 3-stars:
  - With nodes 0, 2, and 4. <5, (0, 2, 4)>
  - With nodes 1, 4, and 5. <5, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7, which we will represent as [7].
