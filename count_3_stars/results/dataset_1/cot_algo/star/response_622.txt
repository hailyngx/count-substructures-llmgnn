Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 4, 7}

Based on the number of neighbors, the potential 3-stars can be formed as follows:

- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed with only 2 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-star can be formed with only 2 neighbors.
- Node 2: 1 3-star can be formed with neighbors {3, 5, 7} (as it has 5 neighbors).
- Node 3: 1 3-star can be formed with neighbors {2, 7, 0} (as it has 3 neighbors).
- Node 4: No 3-star can be formed with only 2 neighbors.
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed with only 2 neighbors.
- Node 6: 1 3-star can be formed with neighbors {4, 7, 2} (as it has 3 neighbors).
- Node 7: 1 3-star can be formed with neighbors {2, 3, 9} (as it has 4 neighbors).
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed with only 2 neighbors.
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed with only 2 neighbors.

Thus, there are total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are:
<[2, 3, 5], [3, 0, 7], [6, 4, 7], [7, 2, 9]>.
Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
