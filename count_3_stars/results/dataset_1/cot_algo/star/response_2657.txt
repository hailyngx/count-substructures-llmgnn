Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 9
Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 8
Node 3: 0, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
Node 7: 0, 5, 6
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 0, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 can each form a 3-star.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars and list them out:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
   <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
   <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   <9, (0, 4, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20 + 20 + 10 + 10] = 60.
