Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-star graphs in this given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 4, 5, 6
- Node 1 neighbors: 4, 8
- Node 2 neighbors: 6, 8, 9
- Node 3 neighbor: 4
- Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 5
- Node 7 neighbors: 4, 5
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 2
- Node 9 neighbors: 2, 4, 5

Now, we calculate the number of 3-star graphs:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-star graphs: \( [1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 1] = 33 \)

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>.
