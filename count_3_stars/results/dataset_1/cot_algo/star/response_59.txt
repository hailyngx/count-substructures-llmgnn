Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 7 3-stars. Therefore, the final result is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (7, 8, 9)>
