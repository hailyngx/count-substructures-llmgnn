Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 9
Node 2: 4, 6, 9
Node 3: 6, 8
Node 4: 1, 2, 6
Node 5: 0, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4
Node 7: 9
Node 8: 0, 3
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 24, which we put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (0, 1, 7)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (1, 2, 7)>
