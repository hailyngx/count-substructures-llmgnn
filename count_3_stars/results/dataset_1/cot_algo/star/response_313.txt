Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 9
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 32].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
