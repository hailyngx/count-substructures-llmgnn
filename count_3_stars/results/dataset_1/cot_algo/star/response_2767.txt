Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's write down the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors where 3-stars could be formed:
- Node 2: has 4 neighbors
- Node 3: has 5 neighbors
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors
- Node 7: has 5 neighbors

For these nodes, we can apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>.

So, the final answer is [34].
