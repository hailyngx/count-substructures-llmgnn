Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}

Next, we'll identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 6 neighbors => \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 44 \)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
