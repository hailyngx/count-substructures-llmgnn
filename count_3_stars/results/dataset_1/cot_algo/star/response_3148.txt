Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 9)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (Nodes 5, 6, 9)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (Node 3)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 9)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (Nodes 7, 8, 9)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 9)
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (Node 1)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (Nodes 4, 9)
- Node 8: 1 neighbor (Node 4)
- Node 9: 7 neighbors (Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7)

Next, we determine the number of 3-stars:
Node 1 and Node 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) for Node 1 and \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) for Node 9. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 35 = 39 \), so the answer inside brackets is [39].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 9, 7)>
- <1, (6, 5, 9)>
- <1, (6, 9, 7)>
- <1, (9, 5, 7)>
- <1, (9, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 7)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (0, 5, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 5, 7)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>

The final answer is:
[39]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 9, 7)>, <1, (6, 5, 9)>, <1, (6, 9, 7)>, <1, (9, 5, 7)>, <1, (9, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>
