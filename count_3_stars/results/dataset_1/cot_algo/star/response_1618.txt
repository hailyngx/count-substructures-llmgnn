Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 7, 9)>

Finally, calculate the total number of 3-stars: [2].
