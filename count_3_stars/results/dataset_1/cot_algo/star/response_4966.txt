Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {7}
- Node 1: neighbors {5}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {2}
- Node 4: neighbors {6}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 2, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {2}

Now we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 \) ([])

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 5)>
<6, (2, 7, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
