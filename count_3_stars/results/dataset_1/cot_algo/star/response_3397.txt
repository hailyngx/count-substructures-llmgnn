Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7}
- Node 9: {6}

We see that only Node 6 has 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars it forms. This is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Therefore, there is 1 unique 3-star in this graph: <6, (2, 5, 9)>

The final total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [1].
