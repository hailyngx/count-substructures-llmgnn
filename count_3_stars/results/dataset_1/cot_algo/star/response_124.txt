Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 90

So, the final answer is [90] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (5, 8, 2)>
