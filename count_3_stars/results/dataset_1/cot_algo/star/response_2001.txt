Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
    1 --- 2
   /|\    | \
  / | \   |  \
 0  |  3  |   6
  \ | /   |  /|
   \|/    | / |
    4 --- 7   9
    |
    5
```

After exploring the neighbors for each node and identifying the 3-stars, we find the following:

Node 0: {1, 4, 7}
Node 1: {0, 2, 3}
Node 2: {1, 3, 6}
Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 7}
Node 4: {0, 3}
Node 5: {6, 7, 9}
Node 6: {2, 5, 7, 9}
Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
Node 9: {5, 6, 7}

Calculating for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we find that there are 3 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the final answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
