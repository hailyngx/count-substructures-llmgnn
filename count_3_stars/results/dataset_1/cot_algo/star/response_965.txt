Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we will first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 2, 3)
- Node 2: 1 3-star (2, 3, 8)
- Node 3: 1 3-star (0, 2, 3)
- Node 5: 1 3-star (3, 5, 9)
- Node 9: 1 3-star (4, 5, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 2, 3>, 
<2, 3, 8>, 
<3, 5, 9>, 
<4, 5, 9>.
