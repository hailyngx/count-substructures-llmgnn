Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 4, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 4 + 4] = [9] \)

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (7, 6, 8)>
- <4, (8, 7, 6)>
- <4, (9, 0, 6)>
- <4, (9, 6, 0)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <6, (3, 0, 5)>
- <6, (5, 0, 3)>
- <6, (7, 4, 8)>
- <6, (7, 8, 4)>
- <6, (8, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 8, 7)>
