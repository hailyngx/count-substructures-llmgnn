Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Has 3 or more neighbors, can form a 3-star.
- Node 1: Has 3 or more neighbors, can form a 3-star.
- Node 2: Has 3 or more neighbors, can form a 3-star.
- Node 4: Has 3 or more neighbors, can form a 3-star.
- Node 6: Has 3 or more neighbors, can form a 3-star.
- Node 8: Has 3 or more neighbors, can form a 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- \( \binom{3}{3} \) for Node 0 = 1 3-star
- \( \binom{3}{3} \) for Node 1 = 1 3-star
- \( \binom{5}{3} \) for Node 2 = 10 3-stars
- \( \binom{6}{3} \) for Node 4 = 20 3-stars
- \( \binom{5}{3} \) for Node 6 = 10 3-stars
- \( \binom{5}{3} \) for Node 8 = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>
