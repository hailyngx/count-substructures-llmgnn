Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {7}
Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 2: {1, 7}
Node 3: {7, 9}
Node 4: {9}
Node 5: {1, 7}
Node 6: {1, 7}
Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
Node 8: {7}
Node 9: {1, 3, 4}

Now, applying the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 35 + 1] = [46] \)

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
