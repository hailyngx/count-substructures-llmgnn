Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {2, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:

\[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [26] \]

Therefore, there are 26 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-star formations are:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
