Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following structure:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to node 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 0.
- Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0:
- Neighbors: 1, 6, 8
- No 3-star can be formed as it does not have 3 or more neighbors.

For node 1:
- Neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Possible 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>

For node 4:
- Neighbors: 6, 9
- No 3-star can be formed as it does not have 3 or more neighbors.

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Possible 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>.
