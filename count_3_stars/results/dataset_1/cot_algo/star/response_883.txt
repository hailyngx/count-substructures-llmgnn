Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 3 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 40 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 7, 8)>
