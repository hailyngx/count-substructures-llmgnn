Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 2: neighbor {8}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars, so we have a total of 10 3-stars with Node 0 as the center.
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars, so we have a total of 4 3-stars with Node 5 as the center.
- Node 7 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars, so we have a total of 20 3-stars with Node 7 as the center.
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star, so we have a total of 1 3-star with Node 9 as the center.

Putting all these together, we have a total of [10 + 4 + 20 + 1] = 35 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
