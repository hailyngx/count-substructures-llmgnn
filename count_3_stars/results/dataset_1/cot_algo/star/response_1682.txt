Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {7, 8, 9}
Node 1: {2, 3, 5}
Node 2: {1, 5, 6}
Node 3: {1, 8}
Node 4: {5, 6}
Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 9}
Node 6: {2, 4, 9}
Node 7: {0}
Node 8: {0, 3, 9}
Node 9: {0, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 1: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 2: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 6: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 8: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

There are a total of \(1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 13\) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [13], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
