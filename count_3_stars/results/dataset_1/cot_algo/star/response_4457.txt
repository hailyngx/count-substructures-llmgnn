Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
We'll first create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {5}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 6}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Does not form any 3-star)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (Can form 4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 4: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Does not form any 3-star)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Can form 1 unique 3-star)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (Can form 10 unique 3-stars)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Can form 1 unique 3-star)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Does not form any 3-star)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [16] \)

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
