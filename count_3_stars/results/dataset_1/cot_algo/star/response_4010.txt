Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3
- Node 5: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 9

For each of these nodes, we can form a 3-star. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 6, represented as [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
