Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 6, 4>
<9, 4, 6>

So, the final answer is [3].
