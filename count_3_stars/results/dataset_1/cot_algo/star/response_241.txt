Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5
- Node 9: 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13
So, the total number of 3-stars is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (6, 7, 1)>
<6, (6, 7, 4)>
<6, (6, 7, 5)>
<6, (7, 1, 4)>
<6, (7, 4, 5)>
<6, (7, 5, 6)>
<6, (7, 6, 1)>
<6, (7, 6, 4)>
<6, (7, 6, 5)>
