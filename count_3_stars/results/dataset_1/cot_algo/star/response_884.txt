Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 0

Now, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 2 neighbors: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 3 neighbors: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 7 neighbors: {0, 2}
- Node 8 neighbors: {4, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 15 3-stars

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 15 = 17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
