Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
Node 1: 0, 2
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 6
Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 5: 0, 4
Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 7
Node 7: 6, 8
Node 8: 0, 7, 9
Node 9: 3, 4, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 1, 5, 7, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 3, 2>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 4, 2>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 5, 4>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <4, 5, 6>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].
