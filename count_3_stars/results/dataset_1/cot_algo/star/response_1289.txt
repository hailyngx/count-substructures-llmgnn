Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 5, 8
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 4, 6, 8
Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
Node 6: 3, 4, 9
Node 7: 0, 4, 8, 9
Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 7
Node 9: 5, 6, 7

Next, we identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors, as these are the ones that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 4, 5

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 10 = 34

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [34], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, and <5, (0, 4, 9)>.
