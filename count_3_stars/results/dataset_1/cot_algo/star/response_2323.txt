Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 and Node 8 have 4 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with nodes having 3 or more neighbors. 
For Node 2, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 8, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 10] = [14] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 9, 9)>
