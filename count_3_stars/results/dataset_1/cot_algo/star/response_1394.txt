Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 1 = 21. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
