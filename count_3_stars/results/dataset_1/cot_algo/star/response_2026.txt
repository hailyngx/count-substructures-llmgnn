Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
1. Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
2. Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
3. Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
4. Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
5. Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
6. Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
