Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list down the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 7
Node 1: 2, 5, 6
Node 2: 1, 8
Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 1, 3, 8
Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 8
Node 8: 2, 5, 7, 9
Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 5, 6: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 6, 7: <3, (5, 6, 7)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 7, 9: <6, (1, 7, 9)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 6, 8: <7, (3, 6, 8)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, 7: <8, (3, 5, 7)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [5].
