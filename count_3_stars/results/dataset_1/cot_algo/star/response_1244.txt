Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 4
Node 1: 0, 6, 8
Node 2: 0, 5
Node 3: 7
Node 4: 0, 7
Node 5: 2, 7, 8
Node 6: 1, 8, 9
Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 8: 1, 5, 6
Node 9: 6, 7

Now let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 4)>
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <1, (6, 8, 0)>
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <5, (2, 7, 8)>
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <6, (1, 8, 9)>
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 6)>, <7, (8, 6, 9)>
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <8, (1, 5, 6)>
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 9.
The unique 3-stars are as follows: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<1, (6, 8, 0)>, 
<5, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (1, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<7, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<7, (5, 8, 6)>, 
<7, (8, 6, 9)>, 
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
