Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 10 + 10 + 10] = 50 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
