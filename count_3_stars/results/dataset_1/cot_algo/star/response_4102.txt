Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8

Next, we'll check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 10 = 21
Thus, [21].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <0, (8, 9, 3)>
- <0, (8, 9, 4)>
- <0, (8, 9, 5)>
- <0, (9, 3, 4)>
- <0, (9, 3, 5)>
- <0, (9, 4, 5)>
- <0, (9, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
