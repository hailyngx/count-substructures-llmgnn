Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: No 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-star (only 1 neighbor)
- Node 5: No 3-star (only 1 neighbor)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-star (only 1 neighbor)
- Node 9: No 3-star (only 1 neighbor)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, which we will represent as [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, and <0, (1, 5, 6)>.
