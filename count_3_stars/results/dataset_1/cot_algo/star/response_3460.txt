Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {4}  
Node 1: {3, 8}  
Node 2: {7, 8}  
Node 3: {1, 4, 7, 9}  
Node 4: {0, 3, 7}  
Node 5: {8, 9}  
Node 6: {7, 8}  
Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6}  
Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}  
Node 9: {3, 5, 8}  

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars  
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \[ [4 + 1 + 4 + 10] = [19] \]

The unique 3-stars are:  
<3, (1, 4, 7)>  
<4, (0, 3, 7)>  
<7, (2, 3, 6)>  
<8, (1, 5, 9)>  
<8, (2, 5, 6)>  
<8, (2, 5, 9)>  
<8, (6, 5, 9)>  
<8, (1, 6, 9)>  
<8, (2, 6, 9)>  
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
