Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, and <9, (0, 3, 4)>.
