Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the provided information, let's first arrange the nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These are: 
<5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>

Node 8 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. These are:
<8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
