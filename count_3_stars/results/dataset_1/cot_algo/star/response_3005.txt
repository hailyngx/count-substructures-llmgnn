Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: {0, 4, 6}, so one 3-star is found.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: {4, 6, 8}, so one more 3-star is found.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: {0, 2, 6}, so one more 3-star is found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. Unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>.
