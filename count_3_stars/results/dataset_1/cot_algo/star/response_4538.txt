Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 8
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 7

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 23

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 0)>
<9, (3, 0, 2)>
<9, (3, 7, 2)>
