Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of nodes in the graph is 10, and the total number of edges is 34. 

We will first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: Neighbor is 0
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: Neighbor is 0
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 2

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 3

Therefore, the answer is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, and <7, (0, 2, 8)>.
