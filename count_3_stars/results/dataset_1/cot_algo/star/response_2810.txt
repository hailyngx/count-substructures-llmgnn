Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 6}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2}

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 8. Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 10 + 4] = [15] \]

So, there are 15 total 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
