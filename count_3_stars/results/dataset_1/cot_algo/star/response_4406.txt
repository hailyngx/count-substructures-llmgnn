Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 3, 7, 8  
Node 1 neighbors: 2, 5  
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 4  
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8, 9  
Node 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6  
Node 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4  
Node 6 neighbors: 4  
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 3  
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 3  
Node 9 neighbors: 3  

Now, let's check which nodes can form a 3-star:

Node 0 does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors).  
Node 1 does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors).  
Node 2 does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors).  
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7, 8 <3, (5, 7, 8)>.  
Node 4 does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors).  
Node 5 does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors).  
Node 6 does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors).  
Node 7 does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors).  
Node 8 does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors).  
Node 9 does not form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors).  

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <3, (5, 7, 8)>.
