Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 1, 6

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 13.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
