Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {4}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-star formations:
Node 1 and Node 4 have 2 or more neighbors, so we will calculate for both:

- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
