Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the 3-star graph can be analyzed as follows:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}. As it has 6 neighbors, it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4}. As it has 2 neighbors, it does not form any 3-star.
Node 2: Neighbors {9}. As it has 1 neighbor, it does not form any 3-star.
Node 3: Neighbors {0}. As it has 1 neighbor, it does not form any 3-star.
Node 4: Neighbors {1}. As it has 1 neighbor, it does not form any 3-star.
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}. As it has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star.
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}. As it has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star.
Node 7: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}. As it has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star.
Node 8: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}. As it has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star.
Node 9: Neighbors {2}. As it has 1 neighbor, it does not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) = 24
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed is [24], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>.
