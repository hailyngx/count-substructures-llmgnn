Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {1, 4}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14

So, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
