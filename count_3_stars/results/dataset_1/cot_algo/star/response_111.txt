Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 1: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3}
- Node 6: {2, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 8}

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
