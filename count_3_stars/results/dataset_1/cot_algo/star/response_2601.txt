Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6, 8

Nodes 0, 1, 4, 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of them:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of [4 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 28 3-stars.

The 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
