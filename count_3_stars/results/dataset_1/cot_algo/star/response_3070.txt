Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 0, 6
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient for forming a 3-star.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient for forming a 3-star.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor, which is insufficient for forming a 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient for forming a 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient for forming a 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient for forming a 3-star.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor, which is insufficient for forming a 3-star.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient for forming a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 = 11.

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
