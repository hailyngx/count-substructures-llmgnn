Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: 2, 3

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
