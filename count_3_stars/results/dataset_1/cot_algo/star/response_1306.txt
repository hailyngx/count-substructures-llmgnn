Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- Node 1: Cannot form a 3-star
- Node 2: Cannot form a 3-star
- Node 3: Cannot form a 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- Node 5: Cannot form a 3-star
- Node 6: Cannot form a 3-star
- Node 7: Cannot form a 3-star
- Node 8: Cannot form a 3-star
- Node 9: Cannot form a 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of 40 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (1, 4, 7)>
2. <0, (1, 4, 8)>
3. <0, (1, 7, 8)>
4. <0, (4, 7, 8)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 7)>
6. <4, (0, 1, 8)>
7. <4, (0, 7, 8)>
8. <4, (1, 7, 8)>
