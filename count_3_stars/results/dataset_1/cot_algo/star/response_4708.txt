Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- From the neighbors list, nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, which can potentially form 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
    <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
    <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, 
    <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 17, which we put inside brackets as [17]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>
