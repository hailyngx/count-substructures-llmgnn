Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 1: neighbor {7}
- Node 2: neighbor {6}
- Node 4: neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 7, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 6, 7}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors {0, 7, 8} -> 1 (3-star)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9} -> 4 3-stars {<6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>}
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors {1, 4, 5, 9} -> 4 3-stars {<7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>}
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors {0, 6, 7} -> 1 (3-star)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars formed is 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10, so the answer is [10].
The unique 3-stars found are <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, and <9, (0, 6, 7)>.
