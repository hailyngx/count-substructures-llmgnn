Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 7

Next, let's compute the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

So, the final result is [13] and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
