Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: No 3-star formed (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-star formed (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: No 3-star formed (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1 3-star formed <9, (7, 5, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
