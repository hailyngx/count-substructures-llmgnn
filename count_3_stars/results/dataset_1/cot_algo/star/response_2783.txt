Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1}
- Node 5: neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 18

So, there are 18 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>
