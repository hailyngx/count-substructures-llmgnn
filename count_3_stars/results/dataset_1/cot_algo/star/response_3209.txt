Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \[ [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [11] \]

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
