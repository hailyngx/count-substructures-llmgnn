Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 5}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars by using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 18 and they are as follows:

<[2, 3, 6], [3, 2, 8], [3, 2, 5], [3, 2, 4], [3, 4, 8], [3, 4, 5], [3, 5, 9], [3, 5, 4], [3, 5, 2], [3, 8, 4], [4, 3, 8], [5, 2, 3], [5, 3, 4], [5, 3, 2], [5, 3, 9], [8, 3, 4], [2, 3, 6], [3, 6, 2]> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].
