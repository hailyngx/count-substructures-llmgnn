Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 2, 4, 5
Node 1 neighbors: 4, 5, 7
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 8
Node 7 neighbors: 1, 3
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 5
Node 9 neighbors: 2, 3

Now let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <3, (2, 7, 9)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <5, (0, 1, 8)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [6] 3-stars.
