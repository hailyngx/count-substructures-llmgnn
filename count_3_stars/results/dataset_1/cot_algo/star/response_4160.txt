Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = 1 (node 9)
- Node 1: Neighbors = 3 (nodes 2, 5, 6)
- Node 2: Neighbors = 4 (nodes 1, 3, 6, 9)
- Node 3: Neighbors = 3 (nodes 2, 8, 9)
- Node 5: Neighbors = 2 (nodes 1, 7)
- Node 6: Neighbors = 2 (nodes 1, 2)
- Node 7: Neighbors = 2 (nodes 5, 8)
- Node 8: Neighbors = 2 (nodes 3, 7)
- Node 9: Neighbors = 3 (nodes 0, 2, 3)

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star. Possible 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Possible 3-stars: 
  - <2, (1, 3, 6)>
  - <2, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <2, (3, 6, 9)>
  - <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star. Possible 3-star: <3, (2, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6, so we put this total number inside brackets: [6].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>.
