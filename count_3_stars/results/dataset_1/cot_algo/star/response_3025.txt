Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 8

Next, we identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 and Node 3 have 3 neighbors each.
- Node 4 and Node 5 have 3 neighbors each.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- For Node 1 and Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.
- For Node 4 and Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 2, and they are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>
