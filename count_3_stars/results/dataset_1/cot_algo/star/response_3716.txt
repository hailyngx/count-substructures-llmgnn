Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8}

Now, we see that nodes 5 and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 14, and the unique 3-stars are:

<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 0)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<8, (5, 9, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
