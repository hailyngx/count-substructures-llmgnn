Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {7, 9}
- Node 5: {7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 10 = 18]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
