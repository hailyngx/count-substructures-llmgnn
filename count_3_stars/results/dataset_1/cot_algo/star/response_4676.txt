Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 6
Node 1: 2, 3
Node 2: 1, 6
Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 3, 8
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 3, 4, 6, 7
Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 38 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [38].
