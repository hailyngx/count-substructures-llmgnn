Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the selected nodes:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 20 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 84 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 84, which we will represent as [84].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>
