Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first find all the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9. --> <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 does not form a 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star as it only has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it only has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it only has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9. --> <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it only has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors but 0 has already formed a 3-star with 7 and 9.

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 2 in total. Therefore, the final answer is [2].
