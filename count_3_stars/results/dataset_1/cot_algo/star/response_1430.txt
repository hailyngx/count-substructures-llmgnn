Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph information, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7
Node 2 neighbors: 3, 6, 7
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 8
Node 5 neighbors: 0
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 3, 8
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 2, 3
Node 8 neighbors: 4, 6

Now, we will check for nodes with three or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>

Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star:
<2, (3, 6, 7)>

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars:
<3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star:
<6, (2, 3, 8)>

Node 4 and Node 8 have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10. Therefore, the final result is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>
