Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 4}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 8}

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \), so it forms 20 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so it forms 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final result is [42] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
