Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, we'll identify the 3-stars:

From the neighbor sets:
- Node 0 has 4, 6, 8, 9 as neighbors, forms 4 of them: <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 has 3, 4, 8 as neighbors, forms 1 of them: <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 8 has 0, 1, 5 as neighbors, forms 1 of them: <8, (0, 1, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6], which are 
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>.
