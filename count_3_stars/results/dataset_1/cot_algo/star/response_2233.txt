Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Since this is a directed graph, we need to consider both incoming and outgoing edges separately. Let's first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up, there are a total of \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32 \) 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [32]
And the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>
