Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 3, 6, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 3, 7
- Node 5 neighbors: 3, 6, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 3, 6
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 2 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 35 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 35 = 96.

Therefore, the final answer is [96] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
