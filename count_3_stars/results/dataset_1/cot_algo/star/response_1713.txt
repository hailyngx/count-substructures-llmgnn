Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 6, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1
- Node 9: 4

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 = 5, which we'll represent as [5].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>.
