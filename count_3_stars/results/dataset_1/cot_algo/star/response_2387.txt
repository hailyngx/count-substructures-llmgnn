Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 4, 9
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the final result is [36] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
