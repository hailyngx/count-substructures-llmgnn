Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is [2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 9

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
