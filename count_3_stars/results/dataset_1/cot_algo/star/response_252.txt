Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 0, 7
Node 2: 6
Node 3: 4, 5, 8
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 1, 8
Node 8: 3, 7

Next, we'll determine the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: [1].

The unique 3-star found is:
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
