Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 9
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's find 3-stars:
- For Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 = 6]

Unique 3-stars: 
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
