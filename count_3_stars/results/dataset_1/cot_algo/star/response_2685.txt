Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 4: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 8: 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 22

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [22]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 9, 3)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Each unique 3-star is listed only once.
