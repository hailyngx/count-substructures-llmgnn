Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 14. 

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <4, (0, 5, 6)>
2. <4, (0, 5, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 6, 8)>
4. <4, (5, 6, 8)>
5. <8, (2, 3, 7)>
6. <8, (2, 3, 9)>
7. <8, (2, 7, 9)>
8. <8, (3, 7, 9)>
9. <8, (4, 7, 9)>
10. <8, (4, 7, 9)>
11. <8, (4, 8, 9)>
12. <8, (7, 8, 9)>
13. <8, (7, 8, 9)>
14. <8, (7, 8, 9)>
