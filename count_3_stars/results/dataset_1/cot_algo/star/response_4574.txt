Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {0, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5}

Now, we will check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0, Node 1, and Node 4 have 4 or more neighbors:
  - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed by Node 0
    - <0, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <0, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (3, 7, 8)>
  - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed by Node 1
    - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
  - \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed by Node 4
    - <4, (1, 2, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
