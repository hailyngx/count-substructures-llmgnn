Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}

The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and can form a 3-star are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 48 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
