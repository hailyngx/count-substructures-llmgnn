Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

0: [3, 8, 9]
1: [2, 7, 8]
2: [1, 4, 8, 9]
3: [0, 7, 8, 9]
4: [2, 6, 9]
5: [6, 7, 8]
6: [4, 5]
7: [1, 3, 5]
8: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
9: [0, 2, 3, 4]

Now, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: [3, 8, 9]
- Node 1 neighbors: [2, 7, 8]
- Node 2 neighbors: [1, 4, 8, 9]
- Node 3 neighbors: [0, 7, 8, 9]
- Node 4 neighbors: [2, 6, 9]
- Node 5 neighbors: [6, 7, 8]
- Node 6 neighbors: [4, 5]
- Node 7 neighbors: [1, 3, 5]
- Node 8 neighbors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
- Node 9 neighbors: [0, 2, 3, 4]

Now, we see that Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 8.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, and <8, (0, 1, 2)>.
