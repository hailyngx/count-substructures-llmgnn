Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 6}
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 7}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 1, 6}
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes {7, 8}
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 3, 7}
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 4, 6, 8}

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars found: 
- <0, (3, 6)>
- <1, (3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6, 8)>
