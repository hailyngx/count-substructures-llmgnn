Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}. Using the formula \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), there are 10 3-stars with node 0.

2. Node 1 has neighbors {0, 6, 7}. Since it has 3 neighbors exactly, there is only 1 3-star with node 1.

3. Node 2 has neighbors {4, 6, 8}. Since it has 3 neighbors exactly, there is only 1 3-star with node 2.

4. Node 3 has neighbors {0, 5, 7}. Since it has 3 neighbors exactly, there is only 1 3-star with node 3.

5. Node 4 has neighbors {0, 2, 6, 8}. Using the formula \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), there are 4 3-stars with node 4.

6. Node 5 has neighbors {0, 3, 6}. Since it has 3 neighbors exactly, there is only 1 3-star with node 5.

7. Node 6 has neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}. Using the formula \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), there are 10 3-stars with node 6.

8. Node 7 has neighbors {1, 3, 6, 8}. Using the formula \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), there are 4 3-stars with node 7.

9. Node 8 has neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7}. Using the formula \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), there are 4 3-stars with node 8.

Summing up the total 3-stars: \([10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [36]\)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
