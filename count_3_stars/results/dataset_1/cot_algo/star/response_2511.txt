Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3}  
Node 1: {3, 5, 8}  
Node 2: {3, 6, 7, 9}  
Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8}  
Node 4: {6}  
Node 5: {1, 3, 7}  
Node 6: {2, 4, 9}  
Node 7: {2, 3, 5}  
Node 8: {1, 3, 9}  
Node 9: {2, 6, 8}  

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)  
Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star  
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 3: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars  
Node 4: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)  
Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star  
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star  
Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star  
Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star  
Node 9: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)  

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [29]
