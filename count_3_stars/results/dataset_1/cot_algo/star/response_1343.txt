Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 1: 3, 4, 5
Node 2: 0, 5
Node 3: 1
Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 8
Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 5
Node 7: 0, 5, 9
Node 8: 0, 4, 5
Node 9: 7

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 8 each have exactly 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = 40 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
