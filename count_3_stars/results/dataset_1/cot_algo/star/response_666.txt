Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 7

Now, let's look at the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 6)>
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>.
