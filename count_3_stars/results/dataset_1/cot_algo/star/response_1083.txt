Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars formed by this graph:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 5: 6 neighbors, can form 20 3-stars <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [39] 3-stars in the given graph.
