Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 7
Node 1: 2, 9
Node 2: 1, 5, 8
Node 4: 7, 8
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 8
Node 7: 0, 4
Node 8: 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 8

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (2 neighbors only)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (3-star with nodes 1, 5, 8)
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (2 neighbors only)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars with nodes 2, 4, 6; 2, 4, 9; 2, 6, 9; 4, 6, 9)

In total, there are [1 + 4 = 5] 3-stars in the graph. The unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, and <8, (4, 6, 9)>.
