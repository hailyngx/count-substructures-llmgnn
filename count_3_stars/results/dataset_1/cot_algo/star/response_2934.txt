Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 6}
Node 1: {0, 3}
Node 2: {4, 9}
Node 3: {1}
Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
Node 5: {4, 8, 9}
Node 6: {0, 7}
Node 7: {6, 8, 9}
Node 8: {4, 5, 7}
Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18
Therefore, the final answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
