Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we'll determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0  (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>
