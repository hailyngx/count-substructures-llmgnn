Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [12] \]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 3, 5)>
