Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars they form:

For node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0
For node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0
For node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

So there are a total of 2 3-stars:

[2]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
