Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8: 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 8

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 1: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 4: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 6: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star

For the remaining nodes with enough neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 12

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
