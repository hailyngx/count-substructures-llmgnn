Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 9 each have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6, and they are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>
