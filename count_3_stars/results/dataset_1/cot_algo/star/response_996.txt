Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {2, 8}
Node 1: {9}
Node 2: {0, 9}
Node 3: {6}
Node 4: {7, 9}
Node 5: {6, 9}
Node 6: {3, 5, 8}
Node 7: {4, 8, 9}
Node 8: {0, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2 has 2 3-stars
- Node 4 has 1 3-stars
- Node 5 has 1 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 10] = [21]

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<5, (6, 9, 4)>
<6, (3, 8, 5)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (8, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 4, 9)>
<8, (9, 1, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 5, 8)>
<9, (7, 4, 8)>
<9, (8, 6, 7)>
<9, (8, 7, 4)>
<9, (8, 7, 5)>
<9, (8, 7, 4)>
