Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {3, 5, 7}
Node 1: {4, 6, 7, 9}
Node 2: {3, 7}
Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
Node 4: {1, 3}
Node 5: {0}
Node 6: {1, 7, 8}
Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
Node 8: {6, 9}
Node 9: {1, 3, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( [4 + 10 + 20 + 4] = [38] \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
