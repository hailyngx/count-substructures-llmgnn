Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {8}
- Node 5: Neighbor {0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:

- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 8: <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
