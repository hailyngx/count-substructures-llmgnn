Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

So, there are 4 3-stars in total, and the unique 3-stars are:
<[0, 1, 3], [2, 3, 5], [4, 5, 7], [6, 8, 0]>
