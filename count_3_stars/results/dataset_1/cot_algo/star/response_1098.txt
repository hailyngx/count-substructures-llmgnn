Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbor {5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbor {4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: Node 4 and Node 8

For Node 4:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
There is 1 3-star with Node 4 as the center: <4, (3, 5, 9)>

For Node 8:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 3-stars with Node 8 as the center: <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 = 5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
