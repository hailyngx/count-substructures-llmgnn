Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {2, 4, 6}
Node 1: {3}
Node 2: {0, 9}
Node 3: {1, 9}
Node 4: {0, 8, 9}
Node 5: {6, 9}
Node 6: {0, 5}
Node 8: {4}
Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 5}

Next, we identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 2 can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
Node 3 can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
Node 4 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 9 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 6

Thus, the final answer is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, and <9, (2, 3, 4, 5)>.
