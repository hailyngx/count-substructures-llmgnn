Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: Not listed, assuming no connections
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 0, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 3, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars around them:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
3. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
5. Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
6. Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (8, 0, 3)>, <6, (7, 0, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>
