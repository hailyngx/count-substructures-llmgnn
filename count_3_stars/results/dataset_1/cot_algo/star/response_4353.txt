Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Now, we will go through each node to check for the formation of 3-stars:

- Node 0: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 1: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 3: It has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4: It has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 7: It has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 9: It has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28].
