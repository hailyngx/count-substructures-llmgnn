Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 7

Next, let's determine how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors. No 3-star can be formed.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors. No 3-star can be formed.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor. No 3-star can be formed.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors. No 3-star can be formed.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor. No 3-star can be formed.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor. No 3-star can be formed.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors. No 3-star can be formed.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor. No 3-star can be formed.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors. No 3-star can be formed.

Therefore, no 3-star can be formed in this graph. The final answer is [0].
