Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 6, and Node 9 each have 3 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, and they are:
<0, (6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>.

Putting the final number inside brackets, we get: [3].
