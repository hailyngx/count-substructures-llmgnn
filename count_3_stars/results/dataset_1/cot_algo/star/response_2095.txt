Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 10 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star

Total 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 26

So, the total number of 3-stars is [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
