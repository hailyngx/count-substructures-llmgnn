Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 3, 5, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 and Node 9 both have three or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are a total of 2 3-stars in this graph:

[2]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
