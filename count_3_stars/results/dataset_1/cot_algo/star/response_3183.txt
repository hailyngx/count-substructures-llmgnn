Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 15.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>
