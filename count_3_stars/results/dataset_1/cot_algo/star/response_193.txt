Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a more readable format:

Node 0 is connected to Node 1
Node 1 is connected to Node 0, 5, 6
Node 2 is connected to Node 3, 6
Node 3 is connected to Node 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 4 is connected to Node 3, 5, 9
Node 5 is connected to Node 1, 4, 7
Node 6 is connected to Node 1, 2
Node 7 is connected to Node 3, 5, 8
Node 8 is connected to Node 3, 7
Node 9 is connected to Node 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 5, 6
Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 5, 9
Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, which we will put inside brackets [].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>
