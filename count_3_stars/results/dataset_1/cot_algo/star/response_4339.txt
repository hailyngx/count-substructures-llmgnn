Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 6}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors which can form a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>.
