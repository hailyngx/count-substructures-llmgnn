Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 7, 9  
Node 1: 4, 5, 6  
Node 4: 1, 5, 8  
Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 9  
Node 6: 1, 7  
Node 7: 0, 5, 6  
Node 8: 4  
Node 9: 0, 5  

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to see if they form 3-stars:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.  
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.  
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:

1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 7) = 7 3-stars

So, the final result is [7] and the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 0, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
