Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( [4 + 1] = 5 \)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
