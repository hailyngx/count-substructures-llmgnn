Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 9

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
