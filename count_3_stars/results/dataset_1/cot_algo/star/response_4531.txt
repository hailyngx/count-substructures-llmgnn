Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with {3, 4, 5}  
Therefore, we have a total of [1] 3-star in this graph and it is <2, (3, 4, 5)>.
