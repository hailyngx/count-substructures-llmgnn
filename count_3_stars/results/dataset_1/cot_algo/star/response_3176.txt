Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
