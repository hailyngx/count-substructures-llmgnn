Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-star structures in the graph, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {2, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {3, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7}

Next, we'll check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if any 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star
  - <1, (3, 9, 0)>

- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star
  - <2, (3, 6, 7)>

- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star
  - <3, (1, 2, 5)>
  - <3, (1, 5, 8)>

- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star
  - <5, (3, 4, 8)>

- Node 9: Forms 2 3-stars
  - <9, (0, 1, 4)>
  - <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2] = [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (3, 9, 0)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
