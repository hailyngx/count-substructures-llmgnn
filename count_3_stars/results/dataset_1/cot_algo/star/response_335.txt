Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 5, 7
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 3: 8
Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 6: 4, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6
Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Node 9: 2

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 2 and Node 4 have 4 neighbors each.
Node 5, Node 8, and Node 7 have 6 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 68 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
