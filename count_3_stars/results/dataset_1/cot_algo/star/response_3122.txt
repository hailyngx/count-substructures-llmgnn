Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7
- Node 5: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 3, 5, 7

Nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7 have 4 neighbors, which is sufficient to form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars each. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 * 4 = 16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
