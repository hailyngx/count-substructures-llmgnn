Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {7, 9}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 5, 7, 9 have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [16] \)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (7, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <7, (5, 2, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
