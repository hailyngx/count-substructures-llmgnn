Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7}

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4] = 30 \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
