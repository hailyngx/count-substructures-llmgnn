Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edge list:
- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 2}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 8 are the only nodes with 3 neighbors, so we can form 2 3-stars using each of them: <2, (3, 8, 9)> and <8, (2, 4, 8)>.

The total number of 3-stars is [2].
