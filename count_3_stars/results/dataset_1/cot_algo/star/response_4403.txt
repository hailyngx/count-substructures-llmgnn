Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 6, 7

Based on the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 1, 2, and 6 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: 
\[ [10 + 10 + 10] = [30] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
