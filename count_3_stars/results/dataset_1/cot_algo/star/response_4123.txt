Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first calculate the neighbor set for each node. Here are the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 2}
- Node 8: {2, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
