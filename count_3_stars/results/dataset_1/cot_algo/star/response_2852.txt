Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2, 5, 9}
Node 1: {5, 7, 8}
Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 9}
Node 3: {9}
Node 4: {7, 9}
Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
Node 6: {2, 9}
Node 7: {1, 4}
Node 8: {1, 5, 9}
Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: Forms 1 3-star
Node 3: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: Forms 1 3-star
Node 6: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 8: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: Forms 6 3-stars

Combining the total number of 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 6 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
