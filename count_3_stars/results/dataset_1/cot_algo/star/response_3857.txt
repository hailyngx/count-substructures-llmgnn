Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 3
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 6
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 3
- Node 7: Neighbors are 4, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 4
- Node 9: Neighbors are 7

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-star structures:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 10 + 10] = [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 6, 2)>
- <7, (4, 9, -)>
- <9, (7, -,-)>
