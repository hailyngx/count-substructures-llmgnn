Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 7, 8}
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 8, 9}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 7, 8}

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [3]

List of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
