Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {3}

Next, we'll identify nodes with three or more neighbors and check for 3-stars:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [26], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>.
