Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 8}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 4}

Now, we'll identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <1, (3, 6, 8)>.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <3, (0, 1, 4)>.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <8, (0, 1, 6)>.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Therefore, there are a total of 11 3-stars in this graph: <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11].
