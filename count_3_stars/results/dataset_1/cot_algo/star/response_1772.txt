Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 0, 1, 9
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the final answer is [23] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
