Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we will first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 3
- Node 1 neighbors: 3, 8
- Node 2 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 3, 6
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 5, 8

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, and 8: <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, and 4: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, and 8: <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, and 9: <8, (1, 4, 9)>

Since each of these nodes forms one unique 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
