Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {2, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, which is exactly 3, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, which is exactly 3, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (2, 4, 5)>,  
<0, (3, 4, 5)>,  
<0, (3, 4, 9)>,  
<0, (3, 5, 9)>,  
<2, (4, 5, 9)>,  
<2, (3, 5, 9)>,  
<4, (3, 5, 9)>,  
<5, (0, 2, 3)>,  
<5, (0, 2, 4)>,  
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
