Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 1, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the final answer is [18], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
