Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 18. 
Therefore, the final result is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
