Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph: 

- Node 0 has 1 neighbor (7)
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor (5)
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (6, 8)
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor (2)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 6)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 7)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 8)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 7)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor (2)

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 2 have 4 or more neighbors, so we calculate: 
   - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for node 2
- All other nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are: 

<2, (4, 8, 9)>
