Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 8)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (nodes 2 and 5)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (node 8)
- Node 4: 1 neighbor (node 9)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (nodes 1 and 2)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 8, and 9)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8)

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (1, 5, 6)>
  - <2, (1, 5, 9)>
  - <2, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <2, (5, 6, 9)>

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
  - <6, (2, 8, 9)>

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars
  - <8, (0, 3, 6)>
  - <8, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (3, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (0, 3, 9)>

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars
  - <9, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <9, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (4, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (2, 4, 8)>

In total, there are 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [13].
