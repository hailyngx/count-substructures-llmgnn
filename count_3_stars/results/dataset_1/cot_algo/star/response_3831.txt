Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes - 7
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes - 7
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes - 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes - 4, 9
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes - 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes - 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes - 5
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes - 0, 1, 2
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes - 2, 4, 5
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes - 2, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 2 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
