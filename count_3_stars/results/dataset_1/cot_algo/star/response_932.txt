Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1 has neighbors: 6
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 6, 7
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0
- Node 5 has neighbors: 7
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 2
- Node 9 has neighbors: 7

Now, we will check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 23, which we will represent as [23].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
