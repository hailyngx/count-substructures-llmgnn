Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 7}

Next, we need to find the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52.

Therefore, the answer is [52] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
