Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {5, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {2}

Next, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <0, 6, 7>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <2, 8, 9>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <5, 2, 3>, <5, 2, 4>, <5, 2, 8>, <5, 3, 4>

Counting all the 3-stars, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 4] = 6 3-stars. The unique 3-stars found are <0, 6, 7>, <2, 8, 9>, <5, 2, 3>, <5, 2, 4>, <5, 2, 8>, and <5, 3, 4>.
