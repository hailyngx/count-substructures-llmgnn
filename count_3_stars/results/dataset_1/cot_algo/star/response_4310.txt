Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 14 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 3

Next, we identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 7, Node 8

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: inom(3, 3) = 1
- Node 2: inom(2, 3) = 0
- Node 7: inom(2, 3) = 0
- Node 8: inom(2, 3) = 0

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <0, (1, 5, 8)>.
