Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 8}

Now, let's check for nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 43

Therefore, the final answer is [43]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>
