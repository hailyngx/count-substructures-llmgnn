Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 4
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 17 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 17 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 0, 9>
<2, 1, 9>
<5, 2, 9>
<5, 4, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<9, 0, 1>
<9, 2, 5>
<9, 3, 5>
<9, 1, 0>
<9, 5, 2>
<9, 5, 4>
<9, 5, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<5, 9, 0>
