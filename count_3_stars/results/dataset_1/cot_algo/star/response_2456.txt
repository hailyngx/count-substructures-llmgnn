Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 33
So, the total number of 3-stars is [33].

Unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

This is the solution for the given 3-star graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges.
