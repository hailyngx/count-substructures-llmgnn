Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 44. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
