Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 19 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 19 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (8, 9, 1)>
- <0, (8, 9, 5)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <7, (5, 9, 6)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 8, 0)>
