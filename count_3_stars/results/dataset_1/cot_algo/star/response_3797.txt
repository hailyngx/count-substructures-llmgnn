Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6

Now, let's identify which nodes have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, 2, 3>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<8, 1, 3>
<8, 1, 4>
<8, 1, 6>
<8, 3, 4>
