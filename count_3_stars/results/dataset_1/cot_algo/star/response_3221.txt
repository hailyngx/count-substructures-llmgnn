Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will first construct the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 1: {5, 7, 9}
Node 2: {3, 4}
Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 8}
Node 4: {2, 3}
Node 5: {0, 1, 7}
Node 6: {3, 8}
Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 8}
Node 8: {0, 3, 6, 7}
Node 9: {0, 1}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
