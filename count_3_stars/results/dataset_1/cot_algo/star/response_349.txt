Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, 2, 5, 6>
- <5, 1, 4, 6>
- <6, 1, 4, 5>
- <8, 0, 3, 6>

Putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets, the final answer is [4].
