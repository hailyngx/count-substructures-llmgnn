Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10] = 18 \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
