Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 26

So, there are a total of 26 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>.

So, the final answer is [26].
