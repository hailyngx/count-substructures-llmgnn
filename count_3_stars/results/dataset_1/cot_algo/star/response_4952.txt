Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3}
Node 1: {3}
Node 2: {4, 6}
Node 3: {0, 1, 7, 9}
Node 4: {2}
Node 5: {7}
Node 6: {2}
Node 7: {3, 5}
Node 9: {3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 also has 2 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [4]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
