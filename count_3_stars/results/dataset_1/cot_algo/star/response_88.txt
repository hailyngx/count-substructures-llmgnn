Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 5}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {1, 2}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 8}

We will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [14] \]

Unique 3-stars found:

- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
