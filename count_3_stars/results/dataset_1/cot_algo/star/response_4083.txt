Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 0, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Now, for nodes with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 (3-stars)
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 (3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1] = 5.

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, and <2, (1, 3, 6)>.
