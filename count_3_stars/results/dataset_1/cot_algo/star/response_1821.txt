Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 5, 9
Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
Node 2: 1, 8, 9
Node 3: 1, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 1
Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
Node 6: 3, 5, 9
Node 7: 1, 5
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 5 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 5 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10] = [34]

Therefore, the 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 9, 6)>, <1, (5, 9, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 2)>
