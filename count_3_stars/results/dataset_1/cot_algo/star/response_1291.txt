Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5

Now let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the final answer is [58] and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>
