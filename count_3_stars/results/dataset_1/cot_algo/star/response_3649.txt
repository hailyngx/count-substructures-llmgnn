Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {6}

Now we'll apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 8)>

Putting the total number inside brackets, we have: [2].
