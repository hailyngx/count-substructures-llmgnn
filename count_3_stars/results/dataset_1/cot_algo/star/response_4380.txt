Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 15, which we will put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
