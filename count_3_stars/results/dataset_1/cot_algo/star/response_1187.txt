Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5  
Node 1: 2, 8, 9  
Node 2: 1, 5, 6  
Node 3: 5, 8  
Node 4: 8  
Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8  
Node 6: 2  
Node 7: 5  
Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5  
Node 9: 1  

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
- Node 1, Node 2, and Node 8 have 3 neighbors or more.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:  
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, so the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<1, 2, 8>  
<2, 1, 8>  
<8, 1, 2>  
<8, 3, 5>  
<8, 4, 5>  
<8, 5, 3>
