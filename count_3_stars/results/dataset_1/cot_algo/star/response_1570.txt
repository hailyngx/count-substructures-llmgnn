Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. 

- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 4, 7
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6 has neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 4
- Node 9 has neighbors: 3, 6
  

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each node is a part of:

- Node 0 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 cannot form a 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Thus, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 8, 5)>
- <4, (1, 8, 5)>
