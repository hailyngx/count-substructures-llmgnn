Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 and Node 9 have 6 neighbors each.
- Node 1 and Node 2 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes 0, 9 (having 6 neighbors): \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For nodes 1, 2 (having 5 neighbors): \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [20 + 20 + 10 + 10] = [60] \]

Finally, let's list the unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 5, 9)>
2. <9, (0, 1, 5)>
3. <1, (0, 2, 9)>
4. <2, (1, 3, 9)>
