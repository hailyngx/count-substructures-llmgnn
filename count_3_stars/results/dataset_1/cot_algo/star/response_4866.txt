Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 8}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 3, and they are:
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>

So, the final answer is [3].
