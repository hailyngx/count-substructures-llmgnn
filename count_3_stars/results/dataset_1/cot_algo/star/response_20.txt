Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: Not enough neighbors.
- Node 2: Not enough neighbors.
- Node 3: Not enough neighbors.
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 8, 9.
- Node 5: Not enough neighbors.
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, 9.
- Node 7: Not enough neighbors.
- Node 8: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, 9.
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 6, 8.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
