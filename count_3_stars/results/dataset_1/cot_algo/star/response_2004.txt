Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 6}
Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 9}
Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Node 4: {3, 5, 6}
Node 5: {1, 3, 4}
Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
Node 7: {6, 8}
Node 8: {3, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: {0, 2, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify any nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the 3-stars:

Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars
Node 1: has 4 neighbors, so 1 3-star
Node 2: has 4 neighbors, so 1 3-star
Node 3: has 6 neighbors, so we can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 6: has 7 neighbors, so we can form inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars
Node 8: has 4 neighbors, so 1 3-star
Node 9: has 4 neighbors, so 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 20 + 35 + 1 + 1 = 59

Therefore, the final answer is [59] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
