Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10, which can be denoted as [10].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>.
