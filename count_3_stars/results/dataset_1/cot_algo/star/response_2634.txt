Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph has the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4}

Node 1 and Node 3 both have 6 neighbors, so they can form 20 3-stars each. This gives us a total of 40 3-stars.

[40]

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
