Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {1}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 8: neighbors {1}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 1 = 21. 

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 6)>, <1, (2, 7, 3)>, <1, (2, 8, 7)>, <1, (2, 8, 6)>, <1, (2, 8, 3)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 3)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 6)>, <1, (7, 8, 3)>, <1, (7, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 6, 3)>, <1, (8, 6, 7)>, <1, (8, 6, 3)>, <1, (8, 7, 6)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 3)>, <1, (6, 8, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>.
