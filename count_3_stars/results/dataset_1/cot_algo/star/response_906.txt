Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 8

Nodes 8 and 3 both have 9 neighbors, so we can form 84 3-stars in total.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [84], and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<(3, 9, 6)>
