Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's indicate the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 7}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18, which we will represent as [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
