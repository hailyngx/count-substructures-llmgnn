Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 38 edges, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 0 has neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}. Since it has 5 neighbors, it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
2. Node 1 has neighbors {0, 3}. It has only 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
3. Node 2 has neighbors {6, 8}. It has only 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
4. Node 3 has neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8}. It can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
5. Node 4 has neighbors {0, 3, 7, 9}. It can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
6. Node 5 has neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}. It can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
7. Node 6 has neighbors {2, 3, 8}. It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 7 has neighbors {4, 5, 8}. It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 8 has neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}. It can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
10. Node 9 has neighbors {0, 4, 5}. It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total count of 3-stars: [10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 57]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 6, 8)>
