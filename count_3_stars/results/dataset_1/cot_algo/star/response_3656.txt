Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4

Now, we'll look for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars.

- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars: <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 2 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars: <7, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
