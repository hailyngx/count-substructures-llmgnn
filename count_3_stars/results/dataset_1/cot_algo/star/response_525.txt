Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {1, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2}

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13, which we will denote as [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
