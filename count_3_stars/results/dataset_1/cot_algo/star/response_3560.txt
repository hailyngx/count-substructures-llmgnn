Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {3}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 1, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {4}
- Node 6: neighbors {2}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 4, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
