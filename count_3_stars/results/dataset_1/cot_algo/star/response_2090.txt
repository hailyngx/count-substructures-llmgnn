Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 1, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 4: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 6: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 7: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 9: inom(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [26]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
