Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

Thus, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>.
