Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 51

Putting the final number inside brackets gives us: [51]

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (1, 9, 8)>

- <3, (6, 0, 9)>
- <3, (6, 1, 9)>
- <3, (6, 9, 0)>
