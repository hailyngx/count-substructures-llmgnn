Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [49].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (4, 0, 2)>
- <6, (4, 0, 8)>
- <6, (4, 2, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (3, 1, 5)>
