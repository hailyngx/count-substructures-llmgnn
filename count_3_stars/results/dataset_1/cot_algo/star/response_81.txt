Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 1

Next, we will check for nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 6 have 4 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4 have 2 neighbors, not forming any 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 = 8

So, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 8, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
