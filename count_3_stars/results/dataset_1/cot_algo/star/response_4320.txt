Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves {3, 4, 5} : <0, (3, 4, 5)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 4, 5} : <3, (0, 4, 5)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 3, 7} : <4, (0, 3, 7)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 3, 6} : <5, (0, 3, 6)> and a 3-star with leaves {0, 3, 8} : <5, (0, 3, 8)> and a 3-star with leaves {0, 3, 9} : <5, (0, 3, 9)>
Node 2, Node 8, and Node 9 do not form any 3-star as they do not have 3 or more neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
