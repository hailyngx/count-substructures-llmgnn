Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following connections for each node:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 2
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to node 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 4
- Node 9 is connected to node 4

Now, we can find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = [16] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
