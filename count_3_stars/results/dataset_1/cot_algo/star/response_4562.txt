Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 6}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: 0, has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 1: 1, has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 2: 2, has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: 4, has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 5: 5, has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 6: 6, has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 7: 7, has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 8: 8, has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 9: 9, has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 8, 9)> and <7, (0, 6, 9)>
