Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 (degree: 5)
- Node 2: 1, 7 (degree: 2)
- Node 3: 9 (degree: 1)
- Node 4: 6, 7 (degree: 2)
- Node 5: 1, 7 (degree: 2)
- Node 6: 4, 8 (degree: 2)
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9 (degree: 5)
- Node 8: 1, 6 (degree: 2)
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7 (degree: 3)

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1 and 7 are the only nodes with 5 neighbors, so they can form 10 3-stars each.
- Node 9 is the only node with 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [10 + 10 + 1 = 21].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
