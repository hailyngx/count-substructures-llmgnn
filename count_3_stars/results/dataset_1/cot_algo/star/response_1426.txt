Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graph in this case is as follows:

1. [
2. <0, (1, 2, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 7)>
4. <3, (2, 5, 7)>
5. <4, (8, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 3)>
7. <6, (0)>
8. <7, (2, 3, 9)>
9. <8, (4, 9)>
10. <9, (4, 7, 8)>
11. ] 

There are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph.
