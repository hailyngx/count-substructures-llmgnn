Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's map out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 0, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of 17 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>.
