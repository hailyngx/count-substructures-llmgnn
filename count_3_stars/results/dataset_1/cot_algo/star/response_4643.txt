Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {0, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {4, 8}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {1, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the final result is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
