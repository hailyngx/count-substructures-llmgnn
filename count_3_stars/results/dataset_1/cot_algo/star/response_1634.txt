Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 9
Node 6: 5, 8
Node 7: 0, 1, 2
Node 8: 6
Node 9: 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form any 3-star.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33 \)

So, there are 33 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them out:
