Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars (since it has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 20 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 38, so we have [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (3, 0, 4)>
- <0, (3, 0, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <0, (6, 2, 4)>
- <0, (6, 2, 9)>
- <0, (6, 4, 9)>
- <0, (7, 0, 4)>
- <0, (7, 4, 9)>
- <4, (7, 0, 9)>
- <4, (7, 5, 9)>
- <4, (8, 4, 9)>
- <4, (8, 4, 7)>
- <4, (9, 6, 7)>
- <4, (9, 7, 5)>
- <9, (5, 7, 9)>
- <9, (6, 0, 2)>
- <9, (6, 0, 4)>
- <9, (6, 2, 4)>
- <9, (6, 4, 7)>
- <9, (7, 0, 4)>
- <9, (7, 0, 9)>
