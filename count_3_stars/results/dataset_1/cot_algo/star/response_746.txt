Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

We will now find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 3}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6}

Now we will check which nodes can form 3-stars:
- 3-star for Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- 3-star for Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- 3-star for Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- 3-star for Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 10 + 1] = [25]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
