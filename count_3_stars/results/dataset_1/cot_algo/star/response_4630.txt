Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if a 3-star can be formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 2)>, <0, (6, 4, 7)>
  
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <1, (2, 5, 8)>

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 9, 0)>, <2, (6, 1, 9)>

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <3, (5, 6, 9)>

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 0)>, <6, (3, 7, 0)>

- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <7, (0, 6, 9)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 15 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
