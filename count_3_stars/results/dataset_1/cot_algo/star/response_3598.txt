Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are:
- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3}
- Node 5: {7, 9}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 7}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Node 3 and Node 7 have 4 neighbors each. So, the total number of 3-stars is \( {4 \choose 3} + {4 \choose 3} = 4 + 4 = 8 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
