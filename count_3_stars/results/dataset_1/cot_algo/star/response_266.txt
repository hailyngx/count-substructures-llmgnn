Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: neighbors are 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: neighbors are 4, 7
- Node 3: neighbor is 0
- Node 4: neighbors are 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: neighbors are 4, 8
- Node 6: neighbors are 0, 1, 7, 8
- Node 7: neighbors are 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: neighbors are 1, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
