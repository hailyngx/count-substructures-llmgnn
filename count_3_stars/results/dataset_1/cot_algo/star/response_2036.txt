Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we will first list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors {2, 6, 9} which forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors {2, 6, 7} which forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 9} which forms 10 3-stars: 
  <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>,
  <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors {5, 6, 8, 9} which forms 4 3-stars: 
  <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors {2, 8} which does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors {2, 3} which does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors {0, 1, 3, 9} which forms 4 3-stars: 
  <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor {1} which does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors {3, 4, 9} which forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6, 8} which forms 10 3-stars: 
  <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>,
  <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 31
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [31].
