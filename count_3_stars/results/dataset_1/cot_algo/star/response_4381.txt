Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
Node 0: There are 3 possible 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>
Node 2: There are 10 possible 3-stars due to having 5 neighbors.
Node 3: There are 1 possible 3-star: <3, (5, 6, 7)>
Node 4: There are 10 possible 3-stars due to having 5 neighbors.
Node 6: There are 4 possible 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>
Node 7: There are 10 possible 3-stars due to having 5 neighbors.
Node 9: There are 3 possible 3-stars: <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is 3 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 3 = 41, which can be represented as [41].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>
