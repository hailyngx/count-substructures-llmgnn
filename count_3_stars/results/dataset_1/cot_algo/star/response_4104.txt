Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 (Degree 5)
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5 (Degree 4)
- Node 2: 1, 7, 9 (Degree 3)
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6 (Degree 3)
- Node 5: 0, 1 (Degree 2)
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8 (Degree 3)
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8 (Degree 3)
- Node 8: 6, 7 (Degree 2)
- Node 9: 2 (Degree 1)

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 (Degree 5) can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 (Degree 4) cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2 (Degree 3) cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 3 (Degree 3) cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6 (Degree 3) cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 (Degree 3) cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
