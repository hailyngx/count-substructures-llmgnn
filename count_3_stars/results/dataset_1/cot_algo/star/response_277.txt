Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 6
Node 1: 3, 4, 8
Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 9
Node 4: 1, 5, 8, 9
Node 5: 3, 4
Node 6: 0, 2, 8
Node 7: 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6
Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 7

Now, we'll identify the 3-star configurations:

For node 2: (0, 6, 8), (3, 6, 8), (6, 8, 9)
For node 3: (1, 4, 9), (2, 4, 9)
For node 4: (1, 3, 9), (2, 3, 9)
For node 8: (1, 4, 6)

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 7. So, the final answer will be [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
