Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 4)
- Node 1: 1 neighbor (node 9)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (node 6)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (node 5)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 7, 8, 4)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (nodes 3, 6)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 6, 9)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (nodes 4, 6)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (nodes 1, 7)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 4: 4 neighbors > 1 3-star
- Node 6: 4 neighbors > 1 3-star
- Node 7: 3 neighbors > 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
