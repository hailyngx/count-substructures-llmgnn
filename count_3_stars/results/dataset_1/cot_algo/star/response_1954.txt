Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbor {8}
- Node 7: Neighbor {3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbor {1}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
  - <0, (3, 4, 5)>
  - <0, (3, 4, 8)>
  - <0, (4, 5, 8)>
  - <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 1: No 3-stars formed with only 2 neighbors.
- Node 2: No 3-stars formed with only 2 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-stars formed with only 2 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-stars formed with only 2 neighbors.
- Node 5: No 3-stars formed with only 2 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-stars formed with < 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-stars formed with < 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
  - <8, (0, 4, 6)>
  - <8, (0, 4, 1)>
  - <8, (0, 4, 5)>
  - <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 9: No 3-stars formed with < 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: [8]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 1)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>
