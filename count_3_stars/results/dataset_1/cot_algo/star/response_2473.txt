Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 5, 6, 9
Node 1: 3, 7, 9
Node 2: 3, 7
Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 3, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 7
Node 6: 0, 3, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 8: 3, 4, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 7. (3, 1, 2, 7) <3, (1, 2, 7)>
Node 7 forms two 3-stars with neighbors 1, 2, 3 and 4, 5, 9. (7, 1, 2, 3) <7, (1, 2, 3)> and (7, 4, 5, 9) <7, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, and <7, (4, 5, 9)>.
