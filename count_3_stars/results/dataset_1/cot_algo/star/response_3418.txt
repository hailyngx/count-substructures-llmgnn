Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 6, 7

Nodes 0, 4, 6, and 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each. This gives us a total of 40 3-stars formed by these nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
