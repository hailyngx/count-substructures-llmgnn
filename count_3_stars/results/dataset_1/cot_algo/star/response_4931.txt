Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 (with neighbors 4, 8, 9)
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 (with neighbors 0, 7, 8 and 0, 2, 8 and 2, 7, 8)
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 (with neighbors 5, 7, 9)
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 (with neighbors 2, 4, 9)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 7

So, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 7, and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>.
