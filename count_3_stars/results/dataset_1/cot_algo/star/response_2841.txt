Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {1, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 2}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7, which we put inside brackets as [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 3)>
