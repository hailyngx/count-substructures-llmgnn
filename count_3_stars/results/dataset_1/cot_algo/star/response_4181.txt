Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10 \), so we'll put this inside brackets: [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
