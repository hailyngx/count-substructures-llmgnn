Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the provided graph information, here is the analysis for the 3-star graph:

1. Node 0 has neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}, forming the 3-stars: 
   - <0, (1, 5, 7)>

2. Node 1 has neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}, forming the 3-stars: 
   - <1, (0, 3, 5)>
   - <1, (0, 7, 9)>

3. Node 3 has neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}, forming the 3-stars: 
   - <3, (0, 1, 8)>
   - <3, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <3, (0, 2, 4)>
   - <3, (0, 4, 8)>

4. Node 4 has neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8}, forming the 3-star: 
   - <4, (3, 6, 8)>

5. Node 5 has neighbors {0, 1, 9}, forming the 3-star: 
   - <5, (0, 1, 9)>

6. Node 8 has neighbors {1, 3, 4, 9}, forming the 3-star: 
   - <8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
