Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 19 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
