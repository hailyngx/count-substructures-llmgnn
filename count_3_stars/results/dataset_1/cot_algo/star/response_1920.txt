Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {0, 2}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
