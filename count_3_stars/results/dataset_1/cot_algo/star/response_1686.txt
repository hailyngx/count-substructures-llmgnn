Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {0, 2}

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 7 forms three 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 2)>, <7, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
