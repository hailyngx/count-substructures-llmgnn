Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 6}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {2, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the final result is [7] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>.
