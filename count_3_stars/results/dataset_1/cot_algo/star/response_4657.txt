Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors = {3}
Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 8}
Node 2: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 9}
Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
Node 5: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4}
Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 2}
Node 7: Neighbors = {4, 9}
Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 3}
Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 7}

Now we can identify the 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28, which we will represent as [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>
