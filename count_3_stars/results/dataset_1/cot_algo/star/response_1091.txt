Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

Node 0: 1, 3, 8
Node 1: 0, 8, 9
Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 3: 0
Node 4: 2, 5
Node 5: 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 6: 2, 9
Node 7: 5
Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 6, 8

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars in this graph. We will start by examining each node's neighbors:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 8, 9}
Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 9} (Can form 1 3-star)
Node 3: Neighbors {0}
Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5}
Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 8}
Node 6: Neighbors {2, 9}
Node 7: Neighbors {5}
Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 9}
Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 8}

Node 2 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
