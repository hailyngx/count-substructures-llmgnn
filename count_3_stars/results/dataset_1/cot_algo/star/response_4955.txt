Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Next, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 also has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 20 + 1 = 21
Hence, the answer is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
