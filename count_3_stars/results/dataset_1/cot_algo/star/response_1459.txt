Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {4, 5, 9}
Node 1: {6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: {7, 9}
Node 3: {4, 7}
Node 4: {0, 3}
Node 5: {0, 6, 9}
Node 6: {1, 5, 8}
Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 8}
Node 8: {1, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (6, 7, 8)> <1, (6, 7, 9)> <1, (6, 8, 9)> <1, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<5, (0, 6, 9)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<8, (1, 6, 7)> <8, (1, 6, 9)> <8, (1, 7, 9)> <8, (6, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 9, so the final answer is [9].
