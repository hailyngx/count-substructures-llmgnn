Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 5, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 28
So, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
