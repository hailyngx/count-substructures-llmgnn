Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 5 forms two 3-stars: one with neighbors {0, 1, 2} and another with neighbors {4, 6, 7}
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 5}

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
