Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2
- Node 8: 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, we will check for nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors - Cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1: 1 neighbor - Cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2: 2 neighbors - Cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3: 2 neighbors - Cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4: 4 neighbors - Can form a 3-star.
- Node 5: 2 neighbors - Cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6: 2 neighbors - Cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7: 2 neighbors - Cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8: 3 neighbors - Can form a 3-star.
- Node 9: 1 neighbor - Cannot form a 3-star.

So, we have 2 3-stars in this graph:
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
