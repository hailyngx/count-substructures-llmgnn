Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {5, 9}
- Node 4: {6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from Node 5) + 4 (from Node 6) + 1 (from Node 7) + 1 (from Node 9) = 7

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>
