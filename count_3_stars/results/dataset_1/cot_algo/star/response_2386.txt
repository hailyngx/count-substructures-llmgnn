Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
