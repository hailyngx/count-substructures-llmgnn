Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding them up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 0)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
