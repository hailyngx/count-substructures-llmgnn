Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 20

Therefore, the answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (1, 7, 9)>
2. <0, (1, 8, 9)>
3. <0, (2, 4, 7)>
4. <0, (2, 4, 9)>
5. <0, (4, 5, 9)>
6. <1, (0, 7, 9)>
7. <1, (8, 2, 0)>
8. <2, (0, 6, 8)>
9. <4, (0, 5, 9)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 7)>
