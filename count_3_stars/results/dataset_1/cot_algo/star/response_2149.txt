Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 3: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 43

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 43.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
