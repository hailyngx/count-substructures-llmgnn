Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {8, 9}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 6}: <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 6, 7}: <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 6, 7}: <0, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
