Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 2, 6

Now, let's check for nodes with three or more neighbors to see if they form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [1 + 4 + 1 = 6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <5, (0, 1, 5)>
