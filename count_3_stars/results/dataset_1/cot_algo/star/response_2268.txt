Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
In this graph, we identify the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 3}
Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 9}
Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
Node 3: {0, 1, 4}
Node 4: {2, 3}
Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 8}
Node 6: {2, 5, 9}
Node 7: {8, 9}
Node 8: {5, 7}
Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 7}

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [24]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
