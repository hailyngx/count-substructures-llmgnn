Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are (10 choose 3) = 120 ways to choose 3 nodes from 10 nodes.

Now let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 5
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 7
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3 has 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 4, 8

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{8}{3} = 56 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6:inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7:inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 56 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 102

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [102], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>
