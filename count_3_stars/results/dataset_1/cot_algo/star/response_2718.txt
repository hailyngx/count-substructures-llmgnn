Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 6: 0, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 3, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 9, 9)>, <7, (7, 8, 9)>
