Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: 1, 3
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
Node 2: 1, 4
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 4: 2, 3, 6
Node 5: 6, 9
Node 6: 4, 5
Node 7: 1, 3
Node 8: 1, 3, 9
Node 9: 3, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 3, 7): <1, (0, 3, 7)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 1, 7): <3, (0, 1, 7)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 4, 8): <3, (1, 4, 8)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 7, 8): <3, (1, 7, 8)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 3, 9): <8, (1, 3, 9)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 5, 8): <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
