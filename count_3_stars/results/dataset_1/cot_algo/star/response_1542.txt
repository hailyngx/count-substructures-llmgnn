Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 2, 6

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0 3-stars (has only 1 neighbor)
- Node 2: 0 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 5: [1] 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 6: [1] 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 7: [1] 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 8: 0 3-stars (has only 1 neighbor)
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)

Finally, summing these up, we have a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
