Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) (only 1 3-star)
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) (only 1 3-star)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 4) = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 8, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>,
<4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 9, 5)>.
