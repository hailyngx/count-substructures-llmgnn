Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
    - <4, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <4, (0, 1, 9)>
    - <4, (0, 3, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
    - <8, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <8, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Thus, there are a total of 13 3-stars in this graph: [13]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>.
