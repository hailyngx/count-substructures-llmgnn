Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 7
Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 8
Node 2: 3, 5
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 4: 1, 3, 7
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6
Node 6: 5, 7
Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 1, 3
Node 9: 3, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
4 (from node 1) + 35 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 7) = 47

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [47], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
