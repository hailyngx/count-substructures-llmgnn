Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 2, 5
Node 1: 0, 4, 9
Node 2: 0, 4, 8, 9
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6
Node 5: 0, 9
Node 6: 4, 8
Node 8: 2, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

For node 0: [1, 2, 5] -> 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars
For node 1: [0, 4, 9] -> 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars
For node 2: [0, 4, 8], [0, 4, 9], [0, 8, 9], [4, 8, 9] -> 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars
For node 4: [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 6], [1, 3, 6], [2, 3, 6] -> 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars
For node 9: [1, 2, 5], [1, 2, 8], [1, 5, 8], [2, 5, 8] -> 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 = 600

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [600], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>.
