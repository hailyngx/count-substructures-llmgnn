Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, 1)>
<1, (8, 9, 6)>
<1, (9, 8, 6)>
<1, (6, 9, 8)>
