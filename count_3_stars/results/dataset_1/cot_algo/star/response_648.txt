Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 7
- Node 4: 2, 5
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5
- Node 9: 1, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 7 each have 5 neighbors, therefore they can form 10 3-stars each.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 = 20, which we'll represent as [20].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <7, (2, 3, 5)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (5, 9, 1)>
- <7, (5, 9, 1)>
- <7, (5, 9, 1)>
- <7, (5, 9, 1)>
