Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 3
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 7

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0 (3 neighbors but has been counted with node 9)
- Node 9: 0 (3 neighbors but has been counted with node 8)

Finally, sum up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [1+1+1] = [3] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 4)>
