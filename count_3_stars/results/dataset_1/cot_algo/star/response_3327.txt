Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1+0+0+1+1] = 3.

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, (1, 3, 9)>
2. <8, (6, 7, 9)>
3. <9, (0, 7, 8)>
