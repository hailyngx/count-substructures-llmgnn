Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's define the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: Not enough neighbors
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: Not enough neighbors
- Node 8: Not enough neighbors
- Node 9: Not enough neighbors

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
