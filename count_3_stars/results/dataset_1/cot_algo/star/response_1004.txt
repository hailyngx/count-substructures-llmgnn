Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors - 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 1: Neighbors - 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 2: Neighbor - 1
Node 3: Neighbors - 0, 4, 5
Node 4: Neighbors - 3, 6, 9
Node 5: Neighbors - 0, 1, 3, 7
Node 6: Neighbors - 1, 4
Node 7: Neighbors - 0, 5
Node 8: Neighbors - 0, 9
Node 9: Neighbors - 1, 4, 8

Now, we look at nodes that have three or more neighbors to identify possible 3-stars.

Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For each node, we calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [14] \) 3-stars.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
