Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can determine the 3-stars in this graph by first finding the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 forms the 3-star <1, (3, 6, 7)>.
- Node 2 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 forms the 3-star <3, (1, 6, 8)>.
- Node 4 forms the 3-stars <4, (0, 5, 7)> and <4, (2, 7, 8)>.
- Node 5 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 6, 7)> and <4, (0, 5, 7)>.
