Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {3, 4}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with neighbors {3, 4, 6}.
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with neighbors {2, 9, 4}.
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with neighbors {2, 6, 9}.
- Node 6 can form a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 9}.

There are 4 unique 3-stars found: <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
