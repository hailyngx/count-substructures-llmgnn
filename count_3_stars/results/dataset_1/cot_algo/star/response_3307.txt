Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: Inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: Inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: Inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: Inom{4}{3} = 4

So, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
