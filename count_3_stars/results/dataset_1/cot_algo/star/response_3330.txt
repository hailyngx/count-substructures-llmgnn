Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 8}
Node 1: {0, 2, 6}
Node 2: {1, 6, 7}
Node 3: {4, 5}
Node 4: {3, 6, 8}
Node 5: {3, 6, 7}
Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 5}
Node 7: {2, 5, 8}
Node 8: {0, 4, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9 

So, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 8, 4)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
