Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 20 + 20 + 10] = 54 \)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 54, and the unique 3-stars found are as listed above.
