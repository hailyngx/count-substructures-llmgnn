Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 4
Node 1: 4, 9
Node 2: 5, 6
Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 7
Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 8: 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 5, 7, 8

Now, we apply the combination formula to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 7, 5)>
<3, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (7, 4, 8)>
<3, (7, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (7, 3, 5)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 7)>
<5, (3, 9, 7)>
<5, (8, 3, 7)>
<5, (8, 9, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>

<7, (4, 3, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 9, 7)>
<8, (5, 3, 7)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 5)>

<9, (7, 5, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 5)>
