Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 1: 3, 7 (degree 2)
- Node 2: 0, 8 (degree 2)
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 7, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 5: 4 (degree 1)
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8 (degree 3)
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7 (degree 4)
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4 (degree 3)

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)> (5 3-stars)
- Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)> (4 3-stars)
- Node 4: <4, (0, 6, 7)> (1 3-star)
- Node 6: <6, (3, 4, 8)> (1 3-star)

The total number of 3-stars is [5 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11].
