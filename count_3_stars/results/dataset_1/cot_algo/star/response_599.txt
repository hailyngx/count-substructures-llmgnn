Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges in a more organized way:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
Node 1 is connected to node 5.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9.
Node 9 is connected to node 8.

Now, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

Neighbor set for node 0: {2, 4, 5}
Neighbor set for node 1: {5}
Neighbor set for node 2: {0, 8}
Neighbor set for node 3: {5, 8}
Neighbor set for node 4: {0, 5, 7}
Neighbor set for node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
Neighbor set for node 7: {4, 5}
Neighbor set for node 8: {2, 3, 5, 9}
Neighbor set for node 9: {8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
Node 2: [\( \binom{2}{3} \)] = 0
Node 3: [\( \binom{2}{3} \)] = 0
Node 4: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
Node 5: [\( \binom{6}{3} \)] = 20
Node 8: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>.
