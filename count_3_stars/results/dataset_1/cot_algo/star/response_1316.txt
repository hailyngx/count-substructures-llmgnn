Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Node 1: {0, 6}
Node 2: {4, 5}
Node 3: {0, 5, 9}
Node 4: {0, 2, 7, 8}
Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 9}
Node 6: {0, 1}
Node 7: {4, 8, 9}
Node 8: {4, 7, 9}
Node 9: {3, 5, 7, 8}

Now, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9 have three or more neighbors. For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, there are 22 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 5)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>

So, the final answer is [22].
