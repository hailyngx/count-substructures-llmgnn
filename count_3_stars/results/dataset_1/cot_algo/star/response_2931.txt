Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 and Node 8 each have 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which gives [3].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (5, 9)> and <8, (0, 2, 4)>.
