Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 48 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<7, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 7, 8)>, <7, (7, 8, 9)>
