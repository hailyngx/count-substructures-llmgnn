Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Next, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2, which can be represented as [2]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
