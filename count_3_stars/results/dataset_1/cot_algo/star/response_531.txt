Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 15 3-stars, which can be represented as:
\[ [15] \]
Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
