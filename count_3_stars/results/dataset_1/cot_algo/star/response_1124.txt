Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 5}
- Node 7: {3, 9}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {4, 7}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2, 3, and 5 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( 3 \times 4 = 12 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
