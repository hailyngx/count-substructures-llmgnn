Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of nodes in the graph is 10, and the total number of edges is 38. 

Let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 5 forms one 3-star: <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
