Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There are a total of 12 3-stars in this graph, so the final number inside brackets is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <6, (8, 0, 3)>
- <6, (8, 3, 7)>
