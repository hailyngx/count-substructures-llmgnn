Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can create the following 3-stars:

- Node 1: (2, 6, 7)
- Node 4: (0, 5, 6)
- Node 5: (0, 4, 7)
- Node 6: (1, 4, 8)
- Node 7: (1, 5, 8)

Since each node with three or more neighbors can form a 3-star, there are 5 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
