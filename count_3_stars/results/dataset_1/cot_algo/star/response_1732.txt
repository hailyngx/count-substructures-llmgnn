Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0, 5 neighbors
- Node 1, 4 neighbors
- Node 3, 4 neighbors
- Node 5, 6 neighbors
- Node 9, 3 neighbors

Applying the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula to each node that has at least three neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Since Node 9 only has 3 neighbors, it does not form any 3-stars.

In total, there are \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 20] = [38] \) 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
