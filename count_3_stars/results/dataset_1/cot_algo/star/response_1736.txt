Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 2: {4}
Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
Node 4: {2, 3, 9}
Node 5: {0}
Node 6: {0, 7}
Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 9}
Node 8: {0, 3}
Node 9: {3, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the final result is [24] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>.
