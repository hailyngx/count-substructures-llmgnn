Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 6, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 4
- Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 4, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 2, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 4, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 4, 5
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 4

Next, we identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms 1 unique 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 unique 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 unique 3-star: <4, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
