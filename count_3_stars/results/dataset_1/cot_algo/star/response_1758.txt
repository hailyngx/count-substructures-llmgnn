Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {1, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up, we have a total of [1 + 10 + 4] = [15] 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (5, 6, 8)>
