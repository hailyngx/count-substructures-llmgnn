Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 4, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: neighbor {5}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1, 3}

Now, we need to find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 3-stars in this graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 9, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 3)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 8, 7)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
