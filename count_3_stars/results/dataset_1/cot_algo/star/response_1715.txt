Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {6, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 6}

Next, we identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 and Node 6 have 3 neighbors each.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 20 = 21 [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
