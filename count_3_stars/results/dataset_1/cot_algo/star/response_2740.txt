Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26, so [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
