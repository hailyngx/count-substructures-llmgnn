Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1 and 3
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 5, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 5: <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 4, 7: <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, 9: <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 5, 9: <6, (2, 5, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4, so the final answer is [4].
