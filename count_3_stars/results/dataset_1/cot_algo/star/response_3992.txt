Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbor {3}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 2, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 7}

Now, we'll check for each node that has three or more neighbors to see if any 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 3)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 4)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 3)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (8, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 9, 8)>, <4, (8, 9, 3)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 4)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 4, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: [22]
Unique 3-stars found: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 3)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 4)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 3)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (8, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 9, 8)>, <4, (8, 9, 3)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 4)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 4, 9)>
