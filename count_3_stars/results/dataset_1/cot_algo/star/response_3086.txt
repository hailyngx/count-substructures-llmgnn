Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5
- Node 8: 0, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
