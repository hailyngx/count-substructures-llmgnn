Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 7}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6, 7}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 6, 7: <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 4, 9: <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 9: Does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (1, 6, 7)> and <7, (3, 4, 9)>.
