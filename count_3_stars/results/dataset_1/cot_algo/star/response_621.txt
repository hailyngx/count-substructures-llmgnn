Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 8, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 7, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: Neighbor is 0
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 5, 6, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: No 3-stars formed (less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 1: No 3-stars formed (less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 5: 1 3-star formed.
- Node 7: 2 3-stars formed.
- Node 9: 2 3-stars formed.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 2 + 2 = 5]

Unique 3-stars:
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
