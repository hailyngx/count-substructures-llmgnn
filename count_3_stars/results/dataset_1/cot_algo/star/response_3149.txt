Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, let's check each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30
So, the final answer is [30].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 2)>
- <1, (0, 5, 2)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
