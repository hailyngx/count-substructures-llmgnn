Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: (2, 4)
- Node 1: (4, 6, 9)
- Node 2: (0, 3, 5, 9)
- Node 3: (2, 6)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 5, 9)
- Node 5: (2, 4, 8, 9)
- Node 6: (1, 3, 9)
- Node 8: (5)
- Node 9: (1, 2, 4, 5, 6)

Now, we will identify the 3-stars:

From the inom{n}{3} calculation:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 10 3-stars.

Adding these up:

\[ [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10] = [24] \]

Therefore, there are a total of 24 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 9, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
