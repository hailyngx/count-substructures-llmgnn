Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbor 8
- Node 1: Neighbors 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: Neighbors 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors 3, 8
- Node 5: Neighbor 1
- Node 6: Neighbor 2
- Node 7: Neighbors 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors 0, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors 3, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 20

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
