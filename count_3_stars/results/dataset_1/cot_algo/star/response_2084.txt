Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3

Next, we'll check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3, 4, 7, and 9 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 and 6 have 4 neighbors as well.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 4 neighbors:
- For nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 \) [20]

List of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
