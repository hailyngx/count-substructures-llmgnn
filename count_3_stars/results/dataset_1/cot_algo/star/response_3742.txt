Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {2, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 1, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8}

Now we can identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:

- Node 1, 2, and 4 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars involving these nodes:

For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.


Adding these up: \( 4 + 1 + 20 = 25 \).

Therefore, there are a total of 25 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, and <4, (1, 3, 6)>.
