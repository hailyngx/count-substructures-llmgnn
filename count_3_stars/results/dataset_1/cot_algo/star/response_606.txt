Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 8
- Node 4: 2, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 2

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{{inom}}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [8] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
