Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 9
- Node 3: 9
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: forms 1 3-star

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1

So, the final result is:
[1]

And the unique 3-star found is:
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
