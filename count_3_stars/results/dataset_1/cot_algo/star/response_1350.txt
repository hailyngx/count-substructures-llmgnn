Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 and Node 8 have 3 neighbors each.
- Node 3, Node 4, and Node 9 have 3 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1 and Node 8, there is 1 3-star each.
- For Node 3, Node 4, and Node 9, we use the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
  - For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up, we have a total of [5] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
