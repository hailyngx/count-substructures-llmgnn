Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 5  
Node 1: 3, 5  
Node 2: 7  
Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 7  
Node 4: 0, 5, 8  
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8  
Node 6: 3, 5, 7  
Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9  
Node 8: 4, 5, 7, 9  
Node 9: 7, 8  

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 3, 5, 7, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 38 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [38] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, and <8, (5, 6, 9)>.
