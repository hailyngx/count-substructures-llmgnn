Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graph for the given input is as follows:
Total number of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>
