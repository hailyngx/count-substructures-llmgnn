Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}

Let's now identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
