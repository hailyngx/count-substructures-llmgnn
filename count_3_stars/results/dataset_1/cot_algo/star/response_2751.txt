Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 3: neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 2)>, <1, (4, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 2)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (4, 8, 2)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star with those neighbors: <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars: <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 35 3-stars. So, the final answer is [35].
