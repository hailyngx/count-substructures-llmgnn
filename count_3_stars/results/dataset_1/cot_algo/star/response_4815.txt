Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 8

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the final result is [10] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (4, 3, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
