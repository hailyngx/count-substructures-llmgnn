Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors: Node 1 and Node 5.
For Node 1:
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 5:
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 = 11, and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
