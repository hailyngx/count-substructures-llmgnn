Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 8

Now, let's check for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [15] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
