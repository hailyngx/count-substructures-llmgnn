Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 8

Now, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8 have 5 neighbors each.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors.

Calculating for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars formed = 10 + 10 + 35 + 4 + 4 = 63

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [63].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
