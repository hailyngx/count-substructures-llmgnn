Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbor {3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>
