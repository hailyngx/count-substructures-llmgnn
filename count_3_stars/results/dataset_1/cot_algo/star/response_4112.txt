Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for the above nodes:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star: <node, neighbor1, neighbor2, neighbor3>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 6. So, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 3, 6>
<3, 1, 6, 7>
<5, 0, 7, 8>
<6, 0, 1, 8>
<8, 0, 5, 6>
