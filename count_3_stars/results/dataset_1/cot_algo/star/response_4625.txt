Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 5
Node 1: 0, 2, 5
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 8
Node 3: 2, 7, 9
Node 4: 2, 7
Node 5: 0, 1
Node 6: 8
Node 7: 3, 4, 8
Node 8: 2, 6, 7
Node 9: 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 1: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
Node 2: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
Node 3: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
Node 4: \(C(2, 3) = 0\) 3-stars
Node 7: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
Node 8: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 8, so the final result is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 7, 6)>
