Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {2, 4}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 40 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [40] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
