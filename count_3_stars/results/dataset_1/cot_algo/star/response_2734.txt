Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5
Node 1: 0, 9
Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 3: 0, 5, 8
Node 4: 2, 5, 8
Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4
Node 6: 2, 8
Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Node 0: 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 2: 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 5: 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 8: 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 28

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].
