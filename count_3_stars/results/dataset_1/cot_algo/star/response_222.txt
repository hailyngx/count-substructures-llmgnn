Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 2

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for the formation of 3-stars. Nodes 2, 7, and 8 meet this criteria.

For node 2, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \). There is only one unique 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (7, 8, 9)>.

For node 7, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). There are four unique 3-stars centered at node 7: <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>.

For node 8, the number of 3-stars is also \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). There are four unique 3-stars centered at node 8: <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 4 + 4] = [9] \).
