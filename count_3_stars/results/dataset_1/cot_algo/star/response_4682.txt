Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {6, 7}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {3}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [16], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>
