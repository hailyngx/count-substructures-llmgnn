Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5
- Node 8: 6, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 4)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 3)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 5)>

There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
