Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) [10 3-stars]
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) [4 3-stars]
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) [10 3-stars]
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-star]

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 27

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>

So, the final answer is: [27]
