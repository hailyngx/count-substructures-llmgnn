Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood set for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 5}

Now, we need to find the 3-stars in the graph:
Node 1, with neighbors {3, 5, 6}, can form 1 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 6)>
Node 4, with neighbors {0, 3, 8}, can form 1 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 8)>
Node 5, with neighbors {1, 8}, can form 1 3-star: <5, (1, 8, 4)>
Node 8, with neighbors {4, 5}, can form 1 3-star: <8, (4, 5, 1)>

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 4 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [4].
