Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9.

Calculating the 3-stars for each central node:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8. Number of 3-stars = 1
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 9. Number of 3-stars = 1
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8. Number of 3-stars = 1
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 9. Number of 3-stars = 1
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7. Number of 3-stars = 1
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 7. Number of 3-stars = 1

Finally, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.

So, the final answer inside brackets is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 4, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 4, 5>
<5, 0, 1, 9>
<8, 0, 2, 4>
<4, 1, 0, 2>
<9, 1, 5, 7>
