Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = 13 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
