Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, 6: <2, 4, 5, 6>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, 6: <3, 4, 5, 6>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 7, 9: <4, 6, 7, 9>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, 8: <6, 4, 7, 8>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
