Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor nodes - 4
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes - 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes - 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes - 0, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes - 7
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes - 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes - 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes - 2
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes - 6, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors. 

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (2, 3, 8), the total number of 3-stars formed is 1 each.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors (4, 6, 7), we'll use the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars: 
  - Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [21] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
