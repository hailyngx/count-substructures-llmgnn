Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3
Node 1: 2, 6
Node 2: 1, 4
Node 3: 0, 4
Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 5: 4, 9
Node 6: 1
Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 1: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 2: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 3: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 6: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 9: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
