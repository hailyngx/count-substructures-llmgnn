Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 2, and Node 6 have exactly 3 neighbors and can each form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 27 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
