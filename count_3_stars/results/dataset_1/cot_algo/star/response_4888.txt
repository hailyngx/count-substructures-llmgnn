Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the neighbor sets:

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 1, 4)>
<5, (3, 1, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 3, 7)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the given graph.
