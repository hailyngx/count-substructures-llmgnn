Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
We first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {4, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 6}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {5}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 3-stars. 

Therefore, the answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>.
