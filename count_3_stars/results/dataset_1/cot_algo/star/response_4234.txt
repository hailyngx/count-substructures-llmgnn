Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the following 3-stars:
- Node 0: (4, 6, 7)
- Node 2: (3, 4, 6), (4, 6, 8)
- Node 4: (0, 2, 6), (0, 4, 7), (2, 3, 6), (2, 6, 8), (3, 2, 4), (6, 0, 2), (6, 2, 4), (6, 4, 7)
- Node 6: (0, 2, 4), (0, 4, 7), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 8), (4, 0, 2), (4, 2, 6), (4, 6, 7), (6, 0, 4), (6, 2, 4), (6, 4, 7), (9, 6, 0)
- Node 7: (0, 4, 8)
- Node 8: (0, 2, 7), (2, 4, 6), (4, 6, 8), (7, 0, 4)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 0, 2)>, <6, (4, 2, 6)>, <6, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (9, 6, 0)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (7, 0, 4)>.
