Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors, can form 3C3 = 1 3-star <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors, can form 3C3 = 1 3-star <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors, can form 3C3 = 1 3-star <9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 7. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>.
