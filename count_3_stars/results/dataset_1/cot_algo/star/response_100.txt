Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 1}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: Since it has 5 neighbors, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (8, 9, 1)>, <0, (8, 9, 4)>, <0, (4, 8, 1)>, <0, (9, 8, 1)>
- Node 1: Since it has 4 neighbors, there is 1 3-star with node 1 as the center. <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 2: Since it has 4 neighbors, there is 1 3-star with node 2 as the center. <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 4: Since it has 4 neighbors, there is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center. <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 6: Since it has 3 neighbors, there is no 3-star with node 6 as the center.
- Node 9: Since it has 3 neighbors, there is no 3-star with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 13, and they are listed as follows inside brackets []:
[13]
Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (8, 9, 1)>, <0, (8, 9, 4)>, <0, (4, 8, 1)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>
