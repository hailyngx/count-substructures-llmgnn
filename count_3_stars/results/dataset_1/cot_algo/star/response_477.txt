Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbor {6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbor {1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 5}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors each node has:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final result is [6] and the unique 3-stars are:

- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (7, 6, 9)>
- <2, (7, 3, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
