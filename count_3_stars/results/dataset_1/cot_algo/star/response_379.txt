Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 7}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars are <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, and <8, (2, 6, 9)>.
