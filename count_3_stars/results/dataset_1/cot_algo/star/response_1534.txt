Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 2: 3, 8
Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 4: 7
Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8
Node 6: 1, 3
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:

Nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8 have 5 neighbors each, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [40] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
