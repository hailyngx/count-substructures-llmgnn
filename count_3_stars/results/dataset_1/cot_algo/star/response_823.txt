Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information, let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars.

For node 0: Neighbors {2, 7}
For node 1: Neighbors {5, 9}
For node 2: Neighbors {0, 3}
For node 3: Neighbors {2, 8}
For node 5: Neighbors {1, 6, 9}
For node 6: Neighbors {5, 7, 9}
For node 7: Neighbors {0, 6}
For node 8: Neighbor {3}
For node 9: Neighbors {1, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: 0 3-stars
Node 1: 0 3-stars
Node 2: 1 3-star (0, 2, 3)
Node 3: 0 3-stars
Node 5: 2 3-stars (1, 5, 6) and (1, 5, 9)
Node 6: 1 3-star (1, 5, 6)
Node 7: 1 3-star (0, 7, 6)
Node 8: 0 3-stars
Node 9: 1 3-star (1, 9, 6)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 6)>, and <9, (1, 9, 6)>.
