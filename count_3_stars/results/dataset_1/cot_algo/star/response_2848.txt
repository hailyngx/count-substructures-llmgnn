Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 4, 7

Next, let's identify any nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1: 2 and 5 => 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 and 5 => 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 => \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 5 and 9 => 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 13
Therefore, the final answer is [13].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <1, (2, 5, 6)>.
