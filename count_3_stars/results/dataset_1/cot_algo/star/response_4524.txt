Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4
- Node 1: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 3, 4, and 7 have 4 neighbors each.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
