Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 32
So, the final answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 9, 6)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>
