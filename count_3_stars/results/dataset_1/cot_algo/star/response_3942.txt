Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we'll determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10] = 18

Unique 3-stars found:
