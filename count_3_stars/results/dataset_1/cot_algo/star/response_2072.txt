Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 8}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
