Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 5, 7} <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: Forms 2 3-stars with neighbors {2, 3, 6} and {3, 6, 9} <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: Forms 4 3-stars with neighbors {1, 8, 9}, {2, 6, 7}, {3, 4, 6}, and {4, 6, 8} <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 8} <9, (1, 6, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars is 7, so the final answer is [7].
