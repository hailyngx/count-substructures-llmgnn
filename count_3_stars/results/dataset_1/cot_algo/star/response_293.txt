Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 0, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 0, 5)>
<7, (1, 0, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
