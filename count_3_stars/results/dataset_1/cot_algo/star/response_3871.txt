Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's identify the 3-star graphs.

Node 1 has 1 neighbor (node 8).
Node 2 has 2 neighbors (nodes 5 and 8).
Node 3 has 2 neighbors (nodes 4 and 6).
Node 4 has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 7, and 9). 
Node 5 has 2 neighbors (nodes 2 and 6).
Node 6 has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 5, and 9).
Node 7 has 2 neighbors (nodes 4 and 8).
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, and 9).
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 6, and 8).

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are: 
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
