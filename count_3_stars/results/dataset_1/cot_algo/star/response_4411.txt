Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the list of neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1+1+1] = 3.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
