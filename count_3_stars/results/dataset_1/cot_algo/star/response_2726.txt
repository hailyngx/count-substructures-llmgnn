Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Next, we'll look for the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1, with neighbors 6, 9, has 1 3-star.
- Node 4, with neighbors 6, 9, has 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9, with neighbors 1, 4, 7, has 1 3-star.

Adding up the 3-stars found, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [13].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<1, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, 1, 4>
