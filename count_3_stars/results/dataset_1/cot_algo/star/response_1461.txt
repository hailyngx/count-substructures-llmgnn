Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 3, 4
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 7
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 4
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3
Node 5 neighbors: 7
Node 6 neighbors: 7
Node 7 neighbors: 2, 5, 6
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 8

Now we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star
Node 8 forms 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [2]

Listing the unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 8)>
