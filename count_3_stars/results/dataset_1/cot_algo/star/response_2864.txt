Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format:

Node 0: 1, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 3
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 1, 6, 9
Node 5: 7
Node 6: 3, 9
Node 7: 0, 5, 8, 9
Node 8: 7
Node 9: 0, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 8, 9), so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 7

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
