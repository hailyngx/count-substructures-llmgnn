Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 9. <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, 9. <3, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
