Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 5
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 6
- Node 3: Neighbor is 0
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 5
- Node 9: Neighbor is 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0, Node 5, and Node 7 have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:

- \(\text{inom{3}{3}} = 1\), so each of the nodes (0, 5, 7) can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, and <7, (0, 5, 9)>.
