Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 6, 7
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 9
Node 3: 2, 5, 6
Node 4: 1, 2
Node 5: 3, 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 3, 8
Node 7: 0, 8
Node 8: 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 2, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 6, 7)>
Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 4)>
Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 6)>
Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (3, 8, 9)>
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
