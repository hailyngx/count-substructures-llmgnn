Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0:  Neighbor nodes 7
- Node 1:  Neighbor nodes 7
- Node 2:  Neighbor nodes 3, 5, 6
- Node 3:  Neighbor nodes 2, 7
- Node 4:  Neighbor nodes 6
- Node 5:  Neighbor nodes 2, 9
- Node 6:  Neighbor nodes 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7:  Neighbor nodes 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 9:  Neighbor nodes 5, 6

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors; in this case, only node 6 satisfies this condition. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

Therefore, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph, which can be represented as <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>.
