Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 4, 6} 
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 8, 9}

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, and <3, (5, 8, 9)>.
