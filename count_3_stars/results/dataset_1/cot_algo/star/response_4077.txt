Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
