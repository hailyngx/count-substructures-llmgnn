Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 6, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 11 3-stars.

Therefore, the final result is [11] and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6, 8)>
