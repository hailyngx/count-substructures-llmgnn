Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {7, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 5, 9}
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 2, 6}
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes {8, 9, 0}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 5, 7}

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (8, 9, 0)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>.
