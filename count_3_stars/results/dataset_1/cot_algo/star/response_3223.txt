Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 7

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these up gives a total of 7 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>

So, the final answer is [7].
