Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 = 5]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
