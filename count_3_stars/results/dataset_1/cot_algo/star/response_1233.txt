Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (2, 3, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
