Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 9)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (Node 3)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (Nodes 4, 6, 9)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (Nodes 1, 5, 6)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 6, 9)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (Node 3, 6)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (Node 9)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (Nodes 0, 2, 4, 7)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors (4, 6, 9): <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 6, 9): <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 3, 5): <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 9 forms two 3-stars with neighbors (2, 4, 7) and (0, 4, 7): <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>.
