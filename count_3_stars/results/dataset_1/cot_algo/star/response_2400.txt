Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 16, which we will represent as [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
