Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 5}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Next, we'll determine the 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: [1] <4, (0, 2, 3)> 
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)

In this graph, there is only one 3-star, which is centered at node 4 with leaves 0, 2, and 3. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found is <4, (0, 2, 3)>.
