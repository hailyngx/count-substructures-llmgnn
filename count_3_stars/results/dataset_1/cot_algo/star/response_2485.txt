Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, we will check for each node with three or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 10] = [16]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
