Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 6
- Node 9: 1, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 6, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 6, and Node 9 each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows: 
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
