Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 1, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 13

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (5, 6, 1)>
