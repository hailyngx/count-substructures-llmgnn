Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 7}

Next, we will identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 4] = 24 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
