Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 neighbors: 2, 6, 7
Node 1 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 1, 5
Node 3 neighbors: 5
Node 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7
Node 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 6
Node 9 neighbors: 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [24]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
