Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's find the 3-star structures present in the graph.

First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (6, 9, 1)>, <9, (6, 7, 1)>, <9, (6, 7, 3)>, <7, (9, 1, 6)>, <7, (9, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 9, 6)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 9, 6)>
