Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 2 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 5 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 9 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>
