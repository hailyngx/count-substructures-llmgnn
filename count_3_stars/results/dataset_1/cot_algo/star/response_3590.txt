Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6
- Node 9: 1, 5, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14\]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
