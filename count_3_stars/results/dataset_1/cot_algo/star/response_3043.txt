Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 8 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [56 + 4 + 4] = [64] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
