Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to build the adjacency list representation of the graph based on the given edges:

Node 0: [7, 9]
Node 1: [6]
Node 2: [8, 9]
Node 3: [4, 9]
Node 4: [3]
Node 6: [1]
Node 7: [0, 9]
Node 8: [2, 9]
Node 9: [0, 2, 3, 7, 8]

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Node 9 is the only node that has 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in:

\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10] and the unique 3-stars are:

- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>
- <9, (0, 3, 7)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>
- <9, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (2, 7, 8)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>
