Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 7
Node 2: 0, 5, 7
Node 3: 6
Node 4: 5, 6, 7
Node 5: 2, 4
Node 6: 3, 4, 9
Node 7: 0, 2, 4
Node 9: 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 2 neighbors (not enough for a 3-star)
Node 2: 3 neighbors (1 3-star)
Node 4: 3 neighbors (1 3-star)
Node 6: 3 neighbors (1 3-star)
Node 7: 3 neighbors (1 3-star)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us [4].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<2, (0, 7, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
