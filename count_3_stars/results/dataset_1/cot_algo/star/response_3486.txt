Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 [12]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 1, 8)>
<4, (6, 4, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 8)>
<7, (6, 4, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 4)>
<7, (5, 6, 4)>
