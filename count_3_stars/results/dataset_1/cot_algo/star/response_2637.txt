Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2, 7
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 3
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 5, 8
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 0: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 3: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star
- Node 5: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars
- Node 8: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars
- Node 1: $ \binom{6}{3} = 20 $ 3-stars
- Node 4: $ \binom{6}{3} = 20 $ 3-stars
- Node 6: $ \binom{6}{3} = 20 $ 3-stars
- Node 9: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: $ 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 95 $

Therefore, the final result is [95], and the unique 3-stars found are as follows:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 0, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
