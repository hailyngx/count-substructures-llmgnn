Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7: 0, 5, 9
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves: (5, 6, 7), (5, 7, 9), (5, 6, 9)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves: (0, 6, 7), (0, 7, 9), (6, 7, 9)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves: (0, 1, 7), (0, 2, 7), (1, 2, 7)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves: (0, 9, 2)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves: (0, 5, 9)

So the total number of 3-stars formed is 9, which can be represented as [9].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>.
