Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 1 -- 4
|    |    |
3 -- 5    7
|    |   / \
6    |  /   \
     9      8
```

After exploring the neighbors of each node, we find the following 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
