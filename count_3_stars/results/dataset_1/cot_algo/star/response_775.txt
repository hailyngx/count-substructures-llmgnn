Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {4, 6}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

So, the final answer is [10], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
