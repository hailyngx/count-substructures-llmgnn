Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: 0

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 37

So, the final answer is [37], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, and <8, (0, 1, 5)>.
