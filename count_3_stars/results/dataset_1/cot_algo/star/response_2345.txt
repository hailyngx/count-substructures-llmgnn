Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 2 neighbors: 1, 5
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 3, 5
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor (less than 3), so it can't form any 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 1 neighbor (less than 3), so it can't form any 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20

Therefore, there are 20 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (7, 9, 5)>, <5, (7, 9, 6)>

So, the final answer is [20].
