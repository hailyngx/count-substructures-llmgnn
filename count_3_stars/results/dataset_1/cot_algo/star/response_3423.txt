Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 18, which can be represented as [18].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
