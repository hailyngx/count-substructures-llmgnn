Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we'll start by listing the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {0, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1.

The unique 3-star in the graph is: <0, (4, 7, 8)>.

So the final representation is: [1] <0, (4, 7, 8)>.
