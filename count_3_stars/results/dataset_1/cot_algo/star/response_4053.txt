Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
We first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 1: {6}
Node 2: {0, 3, 9}
Node 3: {2}
Node 4: {7}
Node 5: {0, 7}
Node 6: {0, 1}
Node 7: {0, 4, 5}
Node 8: {0, 9}
Node 9: {2, 8}

Now, we check for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 also has 3 neighbors, which form 1 3-star with node 7 as the center.

Therefore, there are a total of 11 3-stars in this graph, and they are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 0)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
