Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's identify the 3-star structures present in the graph:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 5, 9.
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

2. Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 6, 9.
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 1 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

3. Node 2 has neighbors: 3, 7.
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 2 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

4. Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8.
   - Node 3 can form a 3-star <3, (0, 1, 2)>.

5. Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 7.
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 4 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

6. Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 7, 8.
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 5 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

7. Node 6 has neighbors: 1.
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 6 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

8. Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 4, 5.
   - Node 7 can form a 3-star <7, (2, 4, 5)>.

9. Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 5, 9.
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 8 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

10. Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 1, 8.
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 9 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [2]
Unique 3-stars found: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>
