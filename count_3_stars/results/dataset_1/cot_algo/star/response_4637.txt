Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By examining the given edges, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 7, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 8, 9
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 3, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8

Next, we will check which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form a 3-star with neighbors: 2, 8, 9
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with neighbors: 1, 7, 9
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with neighbors: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9 can form 3-stars with neighbors: 1, 3, 5 and 1, 7, 8

Calculating the total number of unique 3-stars:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. So, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
