Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {6, 7}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 1 = 12, which we represent as [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<(1, 4, 7, 9)>
