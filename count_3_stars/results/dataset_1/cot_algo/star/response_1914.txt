Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2
Node 1: 5, 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 3, 4
Node 3: 2
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 1, 6, 9
Node 6: 5
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 1, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, and Node 9.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>.
