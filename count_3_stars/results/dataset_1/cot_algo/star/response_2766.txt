Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 8}

We will now count the number of 3-stars: 
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, Node 1 has 2 neighbors, Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 0 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
