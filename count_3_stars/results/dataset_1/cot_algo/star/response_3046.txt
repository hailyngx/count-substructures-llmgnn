Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first find the neighbor set for each node and then count the number of 3-stars based on the neighbor sets.

The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 2 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 34, which we represent as [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
