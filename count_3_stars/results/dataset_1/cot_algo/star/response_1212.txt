Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 5}
- Node 9: {1}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 3 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 5 and Node 7 also have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 5, 7)>.
