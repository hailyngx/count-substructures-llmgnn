Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 8} (1 3-star) 
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 8} (1 3-star)
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9} (1 3-star)
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 7, 8} (1 3-star)
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6} (4 3-stars)
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 6} (3 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 3] = 11.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <7, 4, 8>
- <7, 6, 8>
- <7, 8, 4>
- <7, 8, 6>
- <8, 0, 1>
- <8, 1, 6>
- <8, 4, 7>
