Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: (1, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 1: (0, 3, 4, 6, 7)
- Node 2: (4)
- Node 3: (1, 7)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 2, 9)
- Node 5: (0, 6)
- Node 6: (1, 5, 8)
- Node 7: (1, 3, 9)
- Node 8: (6)
- Node 9: (0, 4, 7)

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 4, 5) <0, (1, 4, 5)>
Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves (3, 4, 7) <1, (3, 4, 7)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 1, 9) <4, (0, 1, 9)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 5, 8) <6, (1, 5, 8)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 3, 9) <7, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
