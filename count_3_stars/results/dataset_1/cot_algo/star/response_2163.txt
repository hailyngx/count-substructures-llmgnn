Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 6}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up these counts, we get a total of 28 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final result is [28] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.
