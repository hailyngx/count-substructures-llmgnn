Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 4, 5, 8, and 9 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
