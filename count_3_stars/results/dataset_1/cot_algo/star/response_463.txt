Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 48, which is represented as [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (7, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
