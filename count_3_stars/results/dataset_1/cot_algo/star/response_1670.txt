Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 6
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned in the beginning:

For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 1: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
For Node 2: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
For Node 3: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
For Node 4: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
For Node 8: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15] and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 3)>, <6, (5, 3, 1)>.
