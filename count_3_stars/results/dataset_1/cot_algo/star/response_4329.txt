Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {2, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 22 3-stars.
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>.
