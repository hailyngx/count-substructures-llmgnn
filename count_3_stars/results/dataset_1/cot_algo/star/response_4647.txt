Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 9
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars using the formula explained earlier:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <7, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Putting it all together, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
