Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, here are the 3-stars formed:

There are two nodes with 3 neighbors: node 0 and node 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for node 0} = \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
The unique 3-stars for node 0 are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 8:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for node 8} = \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
The unique 3-star for node 8 is: <8, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 10] = 20, and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>.
