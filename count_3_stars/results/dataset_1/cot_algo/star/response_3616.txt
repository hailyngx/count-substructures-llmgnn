Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>
