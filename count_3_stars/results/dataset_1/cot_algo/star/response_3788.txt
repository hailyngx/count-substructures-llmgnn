Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1 3-star <2, (4, 8)>
- Node 3: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 2 3-stars <4, (2, 8)>, <4, (2, 8)>
- Node 5: 1 3-star <5, (1, 6)>
- Node 6: 1 3-star <6, (5, 9)>
- Node 8: 1 3-star <8, (2, 4)>
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (4, 8)>
- <4, (2, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6)>
- <6, (5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4)>
