Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
       1
     / | \
    3  6  4
    | / \ |
    0     9
    |     |
    7-----8
       |
       2
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph. 

For each node, we list its neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 4}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 7 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [35 + 4 + 4] = 43 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
