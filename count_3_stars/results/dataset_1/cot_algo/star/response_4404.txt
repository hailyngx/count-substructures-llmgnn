Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {0, 2}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {1}

Now, let's identify the nodes which have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 2, and Node 7 have 4 neighbors each.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- For each node with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
