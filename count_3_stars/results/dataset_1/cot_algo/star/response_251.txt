Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5
Node 1: 2, 5
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 7
Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 4: 2, 3, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 7
Node 6: 3, 8, 9
Node 7: 2, 5
Node 8: 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 6, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
