Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 9
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 0, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 6 neighbors

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 44 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
