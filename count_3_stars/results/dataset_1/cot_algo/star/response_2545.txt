Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 9
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [] = [16] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
