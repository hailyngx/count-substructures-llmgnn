Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6, 8

Now let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the final result is [50] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
