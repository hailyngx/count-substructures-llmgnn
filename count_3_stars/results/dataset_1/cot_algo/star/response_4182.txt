Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <1, (5, 8, 9)> and <3, (4, 5, 6)>.
