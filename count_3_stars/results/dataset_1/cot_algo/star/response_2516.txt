Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- From the list above, we see that nodes 0, 3, and 8 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Therefore, there are a total of \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Putting the final count inside brackets, []: [12]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 8, 9)>
