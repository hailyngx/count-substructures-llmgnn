Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Considering the graph you provided, we'll first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 3: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
