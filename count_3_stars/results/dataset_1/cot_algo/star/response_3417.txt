Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 7, 9
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 6

We can see that nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors. Therefore, we can form 3-stars with these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 6, so we have [6] as the final number of 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 0)>
