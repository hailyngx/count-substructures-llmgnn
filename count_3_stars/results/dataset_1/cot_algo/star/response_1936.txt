Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {3, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
