Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 4, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 4, 5, 8}

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 8, 9} <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 9} <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 8, 9} <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 7, 9} <8, (5, 7, 9)>
  
Since each of these nodes has exactly three or more neighbors, we have a total of 4 unique 3-stars.
The final answer is [4].
