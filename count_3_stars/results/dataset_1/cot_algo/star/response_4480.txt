Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {4}

Now let's find the 3-star configurations:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 54 [54]

Unique 3-star configurations:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
