Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 3
- Node 1 has neighbors: 5
- Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 6
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 7, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 5, 7
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4
- Node 6 has neighbors: 2
- Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 4, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 3, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <7, (3, 4, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
