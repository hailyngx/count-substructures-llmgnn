Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 7
Node 1: 0, 4, 8
Node 2: 5, 9
Node 3: 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5
Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 6: 8, 9
Node 7: 0
Node 8: 1, 3, 6
Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18, which we put inside brackets as [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
