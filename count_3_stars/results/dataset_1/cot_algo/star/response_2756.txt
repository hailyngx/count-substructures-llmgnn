Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {3}
- Node 5: Neighbor {2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbor {0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 7}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 9

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>
