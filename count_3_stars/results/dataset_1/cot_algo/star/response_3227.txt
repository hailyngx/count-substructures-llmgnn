Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 9
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 1, 2

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 = 6].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
