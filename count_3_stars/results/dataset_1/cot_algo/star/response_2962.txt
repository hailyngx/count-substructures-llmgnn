Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {4}
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {3}
- Node 6: neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 4, 6}

Now, let's look at the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <1, (0, 7, 9)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <4, (2, 3, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <9, (1, 4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [3]
