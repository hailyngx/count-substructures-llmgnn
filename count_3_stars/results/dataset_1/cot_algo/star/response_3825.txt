Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 1, 9
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 2, 6

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as they are potential centers of 3-stars:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

For each of the nodes with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4] = 17 \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>
