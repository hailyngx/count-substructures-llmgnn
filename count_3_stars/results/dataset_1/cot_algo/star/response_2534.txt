Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 3, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, 8: <0, (4, 6, 8)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, 9: <3, (1, 8, 9)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, 9: <4, (0, 8, 9)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 3: <8, (0, 1, 3)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 6: <9, (3, 4, 6)>

By counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of 5 3-stars, so the final answer is [5].
