Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2

Now let's identify the 3-star patterns:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star.
  <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star.
  <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so we have 4 3-stars.
  <7, (0, 2, 5)>
  <7, (0, 5, 8)>
  <7, (2, 5, 8)>
  <7, (8, 5, 0)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star.
  <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 7. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (8, 5, 0)>, and <8, (3, 5, 7)>.
