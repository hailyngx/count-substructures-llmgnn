Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, which is more than 3. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  
In total, there are 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final result is [12] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>.
