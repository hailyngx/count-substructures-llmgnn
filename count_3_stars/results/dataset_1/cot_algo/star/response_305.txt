Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
