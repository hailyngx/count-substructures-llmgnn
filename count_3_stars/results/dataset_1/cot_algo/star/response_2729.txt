Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 4, 5
Node 1: 7
Node 2: 0, 6
Node 3: 4, 7
Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 5: 0, 4, 9
Node 6: 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 9
Node 8: 6
Node 9: 4, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: forms a 3-star
Node 2: forms a 3-star
Node 4: forms a 3-star
Node 5: does not form a 3-star
Node 6: forms a 3-star
Node 7: does not form a 3-star
Node 9: does not form a 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
3 3-stars are formed.

Therefore, the final answer is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
