Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 4

Now, we identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors: nodes 1, 4, 7, and 6.

For each of these nodes, we apply the \( \binom{n}{3} \) combination formula:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7 \), so the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
