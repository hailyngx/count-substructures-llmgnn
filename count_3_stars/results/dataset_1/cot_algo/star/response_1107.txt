Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 8: 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6, 8

Next, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 have 5 or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>
