Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
0 -- 1 -- 2
|    |    |
5 -- 6    |
|    |    |
8 -- 7 -- 4 -- 9
```

Since we need to find 3-stars in this graph, we first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 8}, which is <0, (1, 5, 8)>.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 5, 8}, which is <1, (0, 5, 8)>.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 7, 8}, which is <4, (5, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
