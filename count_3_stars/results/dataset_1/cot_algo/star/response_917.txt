Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {6, 7}
Node 1: Neighbors {4}
Node 2: Neighbors {9}
Node 3: Neighbors {5}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6}
Node 5: Neighbors {3}
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 9}
Node 7: Neighbors {0, 8}
Node 8: Neighbors {6, 7}
Node 9: Neighbors {2, 6}

Next, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\) 3-stars
Node 6: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 8: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
