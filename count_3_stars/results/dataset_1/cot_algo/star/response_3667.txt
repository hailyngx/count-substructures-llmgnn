Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 6}
- Node 4: {5}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can form a 3-star. Let's list them:
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>

Since there's one 3-star for each of the nodes with three or more neighbors, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
