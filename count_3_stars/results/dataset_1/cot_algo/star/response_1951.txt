Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors which are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9. For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 43

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 9, 0)>
<2, (4, 9, 1)>
<2, (4, 9, 3)>
<2, (4, 9, 5)>
<3, (9, 5, 8)>
<5, (9, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
