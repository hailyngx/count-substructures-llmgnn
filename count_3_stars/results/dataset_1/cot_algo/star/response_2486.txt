Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
  There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 4.
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
  There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 5.
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 9}
  There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6.
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}

Total number of 3-stars = 20 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 6) = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25], and the unique 3-stars found are <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 6, 9)>.
