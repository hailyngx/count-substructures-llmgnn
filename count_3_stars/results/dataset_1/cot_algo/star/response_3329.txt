Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-stars in this graph are as follows:

\[ [18] \]

<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>
