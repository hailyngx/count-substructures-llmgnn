Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 5, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 2, 6

Now, let's check for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 25\)

So, the final answer is [25] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
