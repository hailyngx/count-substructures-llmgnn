Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 8, 9
Node 1: 2, 8
Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 3: 7, 8, 9
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 2, 7, 9
Node 7: 3, 6, 8
Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34] and the unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>
