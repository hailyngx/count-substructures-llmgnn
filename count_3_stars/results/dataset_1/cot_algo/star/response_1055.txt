Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 8}
- Node 6: {8, 9}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up these counts: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>.
