Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <7, (3, 5, 6)>
