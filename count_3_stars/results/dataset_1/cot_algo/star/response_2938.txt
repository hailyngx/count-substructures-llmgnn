Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6, 7

Now, we will check for nodes that have three or more neighbors to see if there are any 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. (8, 0, 4), (8, 0, 7), (8, 4, 7)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. (9, 0, 3), (9, 0, 6), (9, 0, 7), (9, 3, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, and <9, (3, 6, 9)>.
