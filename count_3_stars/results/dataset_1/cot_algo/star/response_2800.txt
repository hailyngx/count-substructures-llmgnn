Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4

Now, let's check how many 3-stars can be formed:
Node 0: No 3-star can be formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1: No 3-star can be formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: inom{7}{3} = 35
Node 3: No 3-star can be formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: No 3-star can be formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 7: No 3-star can be formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 8: No 3-star can be formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: No 3-star can be formed (has less than 3 neighbors)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 35 + 4 + 1 = 40. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 3)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [40].
