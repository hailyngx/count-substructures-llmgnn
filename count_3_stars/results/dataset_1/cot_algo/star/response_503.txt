Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 1: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 2: <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 3: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 4: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 6: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 7: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 8: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 9: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [6].
