Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
        0-----5
        |     |
        |     |
        5     0
         \   /
          4-3-1
           | |
           7-8-2
           |
           6
```

Next, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 5
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3
- Node 2: Neighbors are 8
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 4
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0
- Node 6: Neighbors are 4
- Node 7: Neighbors are 4, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 5: No 3-star, as there are less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1, 3: No 3-star, as there are less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2, 8: No 3-star, as there are less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3, 1, 4: 1 3-star <3, (1, 4)>
- Node 4, 3, 6, 7: 1 3-star <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 5, 0: No 3-star, as there are less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6, 4: No 3-star, as there are less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7, 4, 8: 1 3-star <7, (4, 8)>
- Node 8, 2, 7: No 3-star, as there are less than 3 neighbors.

Combining all the 3-stars found, we have a total of [3] 3-stars: <3, (1, 4)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <7, (4, 8)>
