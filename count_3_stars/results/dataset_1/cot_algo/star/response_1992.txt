Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 2}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars are:

- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
