Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we'll list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 7

Next, we'll identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 

Adding them up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 8), (1, 3, 8), (2, 4, 6)>
