Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 8, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 8
- Node 4: Neighbor is 5
- Node 5: Neighbor is 4
- Node 6: Neighbor is 2
- Node 7: Neighbors are 8, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
