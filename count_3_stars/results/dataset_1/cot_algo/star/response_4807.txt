Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph described has the following edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.

Now, we will count the number of unique 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 25, which we will represent inside brackets as [25].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
