Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 5}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 7}

Next, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 1 = 6]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 8, 7)>
<8, (4, 0, 7)>
