Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 2, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2: <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3: <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 5: <5, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 1] = 9. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, and <5, (3, 6, 9)>.
