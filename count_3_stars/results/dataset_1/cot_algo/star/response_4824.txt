Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 7: 4
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
From the neighbor set, we see that nodes 3, 4, and 9 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 3-stars each. Therefore, we have a total of \(3 \times 4 = 12\) 3-stars. 

So, the final number of 3-stars is [12], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
