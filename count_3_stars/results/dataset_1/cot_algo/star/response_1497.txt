Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
For this graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, the neighbors of each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {3, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: Since it has only 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1: It has 2 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
- Node 3: It has 2 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: Since it has only 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
- Node 9: It has 2 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1+1+4] = 6 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 8, 7)>
- <4, (2, 8, 3)>
- <4, (8, 9, 7)>
- <4, (8, 9, 3)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
