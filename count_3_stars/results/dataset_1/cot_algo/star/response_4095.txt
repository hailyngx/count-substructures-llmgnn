Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1, 5, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- For Node 1: Since it has 5 neighbors, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. However, Node 1 has exactly 4 neighbors: (2, 3, 7, 8), so no 3-stars are formed with Node 1.
- For Node 3: Since it has 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 9)>.
- For Node 7: Since it has 5 neighbors, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The possible 3-stars are:
    - <7, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <7, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <7, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- For Node 8: Since it has 4 neighbors, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The possible 3-stars are:
    - <8, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <8, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <8, (7, 9, 1)>
    - <8, (7, 9, 4)>
- For Node 9: Since it has 4 neighbors, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The possible 3-stars are:
    - <9, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <9, (3, 7, 8)>
    - <9, (7, 8, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 19.  
The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 1)>, <8, (7, 9, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 1)>.
