Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
Let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 3, 6, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Finally, we add up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 20] = [32] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>
