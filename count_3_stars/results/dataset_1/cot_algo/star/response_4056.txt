Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 9
- Node 5: 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
