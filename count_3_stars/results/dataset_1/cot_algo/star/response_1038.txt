Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 4)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
