Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5

Next, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-star (1 neighbor)
- Node 2: No 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-star (1 neighbor)
- Node 6: No 3-star (1 neighbor)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1 3-star (4 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 = 5

So, the final answer is [5] and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3, 5)>
