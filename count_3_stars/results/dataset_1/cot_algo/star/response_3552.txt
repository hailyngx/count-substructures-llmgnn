Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 8

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 6)> and <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 5)> and <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star: <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star: <5, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, and <5, (6, 7, 8)>.
