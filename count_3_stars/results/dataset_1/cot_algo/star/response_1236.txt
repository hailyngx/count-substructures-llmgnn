Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>
  
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, 
  <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <4, (0, 1, 5)>

- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>,
  <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 9)>

- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [25]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 9)>
