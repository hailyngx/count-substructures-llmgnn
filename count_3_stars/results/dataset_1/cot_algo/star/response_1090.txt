Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 3, 5
Node 2: 8, 9
Node 3: 1, 4, 9
Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 5: 1, 4, 8
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 0, 4
Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 9
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 8

Now we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 4 neighbors
Node 5: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are as follows: <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>.
