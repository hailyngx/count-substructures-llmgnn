Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 9: <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 7: <6, (1, 5, 7)>

There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [2].
