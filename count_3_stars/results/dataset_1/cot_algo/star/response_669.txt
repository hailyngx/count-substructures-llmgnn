Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 6, 7

Next, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get:
\[ [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1] = [25] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
