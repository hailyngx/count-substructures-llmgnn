Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes {7}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes {2, 3, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes {1, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes {3}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes {1, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes {3, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes {0, 3}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 10 = 11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
