Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 1, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>

- Nodes 6, 8, and 9 all have 2 neighbors, so they don't form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 8, and they are:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
