Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [41].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
