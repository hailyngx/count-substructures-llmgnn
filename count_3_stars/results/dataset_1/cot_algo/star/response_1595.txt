Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 7
- Node 3: Neighbors are 4, 6
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 3
- Node 5: Neighbors are 6
- Node 6: Neighbors are 3, 5
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: Neighbor is 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with (1, 2, 7), (1, 4, 7), (2, 4, 7)
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with (0, 2, 9), (0, 4, 9)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>.
