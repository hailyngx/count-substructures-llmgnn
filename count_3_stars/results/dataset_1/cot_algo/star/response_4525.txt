Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:

Node 0: 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 4, 9
Node 2: 4, 5, 8
Node 3: 4, 7
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 6: 4, 5
Node 7: 0, 3, 4
Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 2: 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 5: 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 8: 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
