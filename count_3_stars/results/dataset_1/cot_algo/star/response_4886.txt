Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The list of neighbor nodes for each node is as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {3, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 7:

\[ [7] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
