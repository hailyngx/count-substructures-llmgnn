Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list to better visualize the connections:

0: [3, 4, 5, 8]
1: [3, 5, 7]
2: [3, 4, 5, 7, 9]
3: [0, 1, 2, 7, 8]
4: [0, 2, 5]
5: [0, 1, 2, 4, 8]
7: [1, 2, 3, 8, 9]
8: [0, 3, 5, 7]
9: [2, 7]

Now, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 7}

Next, let's examine the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: forms 1 3-star
- Node 7: forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: forms 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6. 

Therefore, the final answer is [6], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
