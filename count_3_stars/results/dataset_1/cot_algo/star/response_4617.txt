Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {0, 1}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
