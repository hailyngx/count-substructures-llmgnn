Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors. Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [3]
