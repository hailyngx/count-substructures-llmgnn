Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 4, and 6 have three or more neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0: \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For Node 3: \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- For Node 4: \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- For Node 6: \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)

Adding these up, we get a total of [10] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
