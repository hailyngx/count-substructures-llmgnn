Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7

Now, let's find the 3-star structures:
- Node 0: This node has 3 neighbors. It forms one 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 1: This node has 4 neighbors. It forms four 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 2: This node has 4 neighbors. It forms four 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 3: This node has 4 neighbors. It forms four 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: This node has 3 neighbors. It forms one 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 6: This node has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 7: This node has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 8: This node has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 9: This node has 3 neighbors. It forms one 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 15. 

Thus, the final result is [15] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>
