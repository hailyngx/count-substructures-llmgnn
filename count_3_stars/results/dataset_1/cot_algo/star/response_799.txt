Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7
- Node 9: 5, 7

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 29
Therefore, the final answer is [29].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (6, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (8, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
