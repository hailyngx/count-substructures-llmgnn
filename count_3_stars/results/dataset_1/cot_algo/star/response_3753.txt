Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 3, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 8, and Node 9 have 5, 6, 5, and 6 neighbors respectively, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \([10 + 20 + 10 + 20] = [60]\).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
