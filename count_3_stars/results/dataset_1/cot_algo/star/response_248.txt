Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <4, (6, 7, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>.
