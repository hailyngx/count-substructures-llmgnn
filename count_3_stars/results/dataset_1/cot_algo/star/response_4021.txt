Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 7}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars:

- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>

- Node 3: has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-stars.

- Node 4: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
<4, (0, 3, 6)>

- Node 6: has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-stars.

- Node 7: has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-stars.

- Node 8: has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 5, and they are listed as follows:

[5]
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>
