Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {1, 8}
- Node 1 neighbors: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 2 neighbors: {8, 9}
- Node 3 neighbors: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5 neighbors: {6, 9}
- Node 6 neighbors: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7 neighbors: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 8 neighbors: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 9 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 5}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 13 \).

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
