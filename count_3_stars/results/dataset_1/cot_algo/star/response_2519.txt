Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, 4: <2, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
