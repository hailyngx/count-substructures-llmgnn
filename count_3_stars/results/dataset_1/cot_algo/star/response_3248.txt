Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 5}

Based on the neighbor sets, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
