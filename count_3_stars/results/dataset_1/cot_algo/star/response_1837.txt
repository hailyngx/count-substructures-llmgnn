Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10 3-stars in total.

So, the final answer is [10] with the unique 3-stars <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>.
