Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 5}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [0 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1] = 16, and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>.
