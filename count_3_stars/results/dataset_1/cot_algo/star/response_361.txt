Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 1, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-stars (has only 3 neighbors, which is the minimum required)
- Node 3: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 = 11.

So, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
