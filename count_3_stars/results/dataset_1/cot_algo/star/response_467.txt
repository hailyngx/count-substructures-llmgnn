Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8]. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>
