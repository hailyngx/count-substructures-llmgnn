Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is 4, so the final answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 7, 9)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
