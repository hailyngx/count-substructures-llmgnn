Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {4, 6, 7, 9}
Node 1: {7, 9}
Node 2: {5, 9}
Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 7}
Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6}
Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 7}
Node 6: {0, 3, 4}
Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 7}

Now, let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>

Node 3 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars:
<3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars:
<4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 5 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars:
<5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>

Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars:
<7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (5, 7, 9)>

Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars:
<9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [30]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 30.
