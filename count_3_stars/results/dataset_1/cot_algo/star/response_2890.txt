Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {5}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 7}

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars in this graph. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors will potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [20 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 29 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
3. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
4. <0, (1, 3, 7)>
5. <0, (2, 3, 6)>
6. <0, (2, 3, 7)>
7. <0, (6, 7, 9)>
8. <2, (0, 1, 7)>
9. <3, (0, 1, 6)>
10. <3, (0, 1, 7)>
11. <3, (0, 6, 9)>
12. <3, (1, 2, 7)>
13. <3, (2, 0, 1)>
14. <6, (0, 3, 9)>
15. <7, (0, 2, 3)>
16. <7, (0, 2, 5)>
17. <7, (0, 2, 9)>
18. <7, (0, 5, 9)>
19. <7, (2, 5, 9)>
20. <9, (0, 6, 7)>
