Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {6, 9}
Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 9}
Node 2: {1, 7}
Node 3: {1}
Node 4: {9}
Node 5: {6, 7, 9}
Node 6: {0, 1, 5, 9}
Node 7: {2, 5, 9}
Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Next, we will check which nodes have a neighbor set of size 3 or more and count the number of 3-stars centered at those nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 9, 0)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (9, 0, 1)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, and <9, (0, 1, 6)>.
