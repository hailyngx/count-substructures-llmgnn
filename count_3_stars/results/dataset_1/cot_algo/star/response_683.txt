Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3, 6, 8 have 4 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- For Node 0: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \text{inom}{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \text{inom}{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 35 + 35 + 20 = 94

So, the final number inside brackets is [94].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
