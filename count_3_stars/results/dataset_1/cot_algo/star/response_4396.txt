Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars and identify them, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5}

Now let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: Has 3 neighbors ({2, 3, 5}), so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 5)>

Node 5: Has 4 neighbors ({0, 6, 7, 9}), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<5, (0, 6, 7)>, 
<5, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<5, (0, 7, 9)>,
<5, (6, 7, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 = 5].
