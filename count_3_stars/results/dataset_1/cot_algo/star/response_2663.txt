Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2 and 8.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 4, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0 and 8.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 4 and 9.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 5: Neighbor is 1.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 4 and 9.
- Node 7: Neighbor is 1.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 3, 6, and 8.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and the 3-stars formed:

- Node 1, 4, 8 each have 4 neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of these nodes.
- Node 0, 2, 3, 6, 9 have 2 or fewer neighbors, so they do not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
