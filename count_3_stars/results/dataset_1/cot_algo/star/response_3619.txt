Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
Node 1: 0, 2, 4 (3 neighbors)
Node 2: 1, 4, 9 (3 neighbors)
Node 3: 4, 6 (2 neighbors)
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 (6 neighbors)
Node 5: 0, 4, 7 (3 neighbors)
Node 6: 3, 8 (2 neighbors)
Node 7: 5, 8, 9 (3 neighbors)
Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9 (5 neighbors)
Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8 (5 neighbors)

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 1: <1, (0, 4, 8)>
Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 3: No 3-star
Node 4: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 5: <5, (0, 4, 7)>
Node 6: No 3-star
Node 7: No 3-star
Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 9: No 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 35

Therefore, the final answer is [35] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>
