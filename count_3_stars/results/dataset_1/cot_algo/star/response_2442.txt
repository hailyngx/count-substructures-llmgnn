Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 6, 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 3, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 3, 5
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2
- Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to compute \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of them:

For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
