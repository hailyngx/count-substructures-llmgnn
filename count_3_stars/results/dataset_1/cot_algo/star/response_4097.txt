Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Yes
- Node 1: Yes
- Node 4: Yes
- Node 6: Yes
- Node 9: Yes

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [11]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 11.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
