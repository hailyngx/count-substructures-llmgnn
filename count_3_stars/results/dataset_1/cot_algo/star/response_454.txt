Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 8
Node 4: 1, 3, 8
Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 8
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8
Node 7: 0, 9
Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 9: 0, 2, 7, 8

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 20 + 20 + 56 + 4 = 100.

Now, we will list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [100].
