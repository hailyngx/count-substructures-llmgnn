Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 5
Node 4: 0, 1
Node 5: 2, 3, 8
Node 6: 1
Node 7: 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
