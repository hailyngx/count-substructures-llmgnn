Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes = {4}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes = {6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes = {4, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes = {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes = {3}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes = {2}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes = {4}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes = {2, 4}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars involving node 4 are <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, and <4, (3, 7, 9)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, and <4, (3, 7, 9)>.
