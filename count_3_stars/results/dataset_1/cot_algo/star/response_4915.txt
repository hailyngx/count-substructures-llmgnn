Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 1, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 1
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13] with the unique 3-stars being:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>
