Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 9
Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 1, 9
Node 3: 4, 6, 9
Node 4: 3, 6
Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 7: 1
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
