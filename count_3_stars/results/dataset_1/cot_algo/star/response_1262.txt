Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 4, 7

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors = 1 3-star 
- Node 2: 5 neighbors = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 4: 5 neighbors = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 5: 3 neighbors = 1 3-star 
- Node 7: 4 neighbors = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the final count is [26] and the list of unique 3-stars is: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>.
