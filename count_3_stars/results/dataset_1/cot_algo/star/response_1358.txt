Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 7}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
