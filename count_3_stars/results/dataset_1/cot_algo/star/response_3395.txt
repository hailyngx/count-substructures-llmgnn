Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 7)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 6)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 5, 9)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 6, 7)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>.
