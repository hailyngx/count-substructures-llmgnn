Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 6

Now, we'll find the 3-stars in the graph:
In this case, nodes 1, 6, and 8 have 4, 4, and 3 neighbors respectively, so we need to calculate \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 \) 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
