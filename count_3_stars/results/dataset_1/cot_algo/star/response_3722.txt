Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 5

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
