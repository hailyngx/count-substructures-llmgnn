Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: None (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: None (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: [10 choose 3] = 120 (3-stars)
- Node 3: [10 choose 3] = 120 (3-stars)
- Node 4: 1 3-star <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 5: 1 3-star <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 6: None (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: None (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: None (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: None (has less than 3 neighbors)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [120 + 120 + 1 + 1] = 242, and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
