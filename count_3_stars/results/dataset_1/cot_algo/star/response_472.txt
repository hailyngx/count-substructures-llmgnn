Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 7, 8} -> <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 7} -> <3, (1, 2, 7)>

Count of 3-stars = 2
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
