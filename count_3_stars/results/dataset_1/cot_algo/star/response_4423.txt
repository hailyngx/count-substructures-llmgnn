Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: Neighbors are 2, 4, 6
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: Neighbor is 5
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 4

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with the neighbors 1, 5, 6: <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with the neighbors 5, 7, 9: <4, (5, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 2, so the final result in brackets is [2].
