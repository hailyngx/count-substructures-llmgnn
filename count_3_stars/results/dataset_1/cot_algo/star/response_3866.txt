Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5

Node 1: 2, 8

Node 2: 1, 4, 7

Node 3: 4, 9

Node 4: 2, 3, 6

Node 5: 0, 7

Node 6: 4

Node 7: 2, 5

Node 8: 1

Node 9: 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: Does not form any 3-star as it only has 1 neighbor.

Node 1: Forms 1 three-star.

Node 2: Forms 2 three-stars.

Node 3: Does not form any 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.

Node 4: Forms 1 three-star.

Node 5: Does not form any 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.

Node 6: Does not form any 3-star as it only has 1 neighbor.

Node 7: Does not form any 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.

Node 8: Does not form any 3-star as it only has 1 neighbor.

Node 9: Does not form any 3-star as it only has 1 neighbor.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 3, which we'll represent as [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
