Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [22] \)

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 0, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (3, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (6, 4, 7)>
<8, (7, 4, 6)>
<8, (7, 6, 4)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 4, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 6, 9)>
