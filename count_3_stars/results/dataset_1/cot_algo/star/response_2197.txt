Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 3, 4, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) -> 1 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) -> 1 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) -> 10 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) -> 4 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) -> 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 17
Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [17].

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <4, (6, 1, 7)>
- <4, (6, 3, 7)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- <7, (3, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>
