Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, the 3-star structures can be found by examining the neighbors of each node. Here are the steps to determine the 3-stars:

1. List the neighbors of each node:
   - Node 0: {3, 6, 7}
   - Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
   - Node 2: {1, 5, 7}
   - Node 3: {0, 6}
   - Node 5: {1, 2, 9}
   - Node 6: {0, 1, 3}
   - Node 7: {0, 2}
   - Node 8: {1}
   - Node 9: {1, 5}

2. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
   - Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

3. Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 14. Here are the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<1, (2, 5, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 6, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 8, 9)>, 
<1, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<1, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<1, (5, 8, 9)>, 
<1, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<5, (1, 2, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 3, 1)>.
