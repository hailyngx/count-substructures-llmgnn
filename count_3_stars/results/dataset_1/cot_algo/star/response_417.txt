Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 1: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {1, 2}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 1 = 12, which we will represent inside brackets as [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (3, 9, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (2, 9, 5)>
