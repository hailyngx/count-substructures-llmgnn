Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0 neighbors: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 2 neighbors: {5, 7}
- Node 3 neighbors: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 4 neighbors: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 5 neighbors: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 6 neighbors: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 7 neighbors: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 8 neighbors: {9}
- Node 9 neighbors: {8}

Nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, which we will represent as [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
