Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 8

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (7, 9, 8)>
