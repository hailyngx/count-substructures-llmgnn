Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7

Now, we will check nodes that have three or more neighbors to find 3-stars:
- Node 1 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
    - <2, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <2, (0, 1, 8)>
    - <2, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
    - <3, (1, 2, 6)>
    - <3, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 11.
The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
