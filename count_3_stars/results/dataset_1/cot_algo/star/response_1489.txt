Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 4, 5, 6
Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 4
Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9
Node 7: 1
Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 6

Now, we'll go through each node and check for the formation of 3-stars:

Node 0: It has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 possible 3-stars: 
    <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>
Node 2: It has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.
Node 4: It has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 possible 3-stars: 
    <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 0, 9)>, <4, (6, 5, 9)>
Node 5: It has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 possible 3-stars: 
    <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 0, 9)>, <5, (6, 4, 9)>
Node 6: It has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 possible 3-stars: 
    <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 0, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 0, 9)>, <6, (5, 4, 9)>, <6, (9, 0, 4)>
Node 7: It has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.
Node 9: It has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 possible 3-stars: 
    <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Counting up the total number of 3-stars gives [0] + 4 + [0] + 4 + 4 + 10 + [0] + 4 = 26.

Therefore, the final result is [26] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 0, 9)>, <4, (6, 5, 9)>, 
<5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 0, 9)>, <5, (6, 4, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 0, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 0, 9)>, <6, (5, 4, 9)>, <6, (9, 0, 4)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>
