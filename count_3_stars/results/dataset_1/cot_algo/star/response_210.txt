Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

So, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
