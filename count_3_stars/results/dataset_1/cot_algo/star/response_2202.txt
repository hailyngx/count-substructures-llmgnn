Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 8}

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 \), so the final answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 6)>, <1, (4, 8, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (8, 6, 7)>, <1, (8, 6, 4)>, <1, (8, 7, 4)>, <1, (9, 8, 4)>, <1, (9, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 4)>, <8, (1, 7, 4)>, <8, (6, 7, 4)>.
