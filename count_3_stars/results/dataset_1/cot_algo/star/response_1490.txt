Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 7, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 2
- Node 7: Neighbors are 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 3, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 5, 6), so we have 1 3-star here.
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (5, 7, 9), so we have 1 3-star here.
Node 8 forms 2 3-stars with neighbors (1, 5, 7) and (1, 7, 9).
Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 2] = [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>
