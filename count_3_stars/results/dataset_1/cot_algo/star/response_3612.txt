Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star because it has 3 neighbors: (5, 6, 8)
Node 4 forms a 3-star because it has 4 neighbors: (1, 3, 7), (1, 7, 9), (3, 7, 8), (4, 7, 8)
Node 7 forms a 3-star because it has 5 neighbors: (3, 4, 6), (3, 4, 8), (3, 6, 9), (4, 6, 9), (4, 8, 9)
Node 8 forms a 3-star because it has 5 neighbors: (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 9), (2, 4, 7), (2, 7, 9), (4, 7, 9)
Node 9 forms a 3-star because it has 4 neighbors: (1, 6, 7), (1, 7, 8), (6, 7, 8), (6, 7, 9)

There are 5 unique 3-stars, so the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. These unique 3-stars are: <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>.
