Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 7
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7: <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8: <6, (5, 7, 8)>

Since each 3-star is counted twice in the process, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
