Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1 and 4
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: neighbors are 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: neighbor is 5
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 3, 4
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 7
- Node 7: neighbors are 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 2, 4
- Node 9: neighbors are 1, 7

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 4, and 7 have 7, 5, and 4 neighbors respectively, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 35 + 10 + 4 = 49

So, the final answer is [49] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 9, 4)>,
<(2, 7, 9), 1>, <(2, 7, 9), 4>, <(4, 5, 7), 1>, <(5, 6, 7), 1>, <(6, 7, 9), 1>, <(7, 9, 4), 1>
