Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 7}

Next, we'll check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 7, and Node 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 10 + 35 = 46.

Therefore, the final answer is [46] with the unique 3-stars listed as:
