Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 8}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 7, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up, we have a total of 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the answer is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, and <8, (3, 7, 9)>.
