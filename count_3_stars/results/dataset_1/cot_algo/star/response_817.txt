Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 5

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 = 12], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>.
