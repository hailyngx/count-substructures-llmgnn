Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

So the final answer is [50] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
