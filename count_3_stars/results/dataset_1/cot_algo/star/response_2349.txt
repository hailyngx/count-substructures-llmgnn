Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 6, 9

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
