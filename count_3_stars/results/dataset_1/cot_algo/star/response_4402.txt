Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 8

Next, we will check for each node that has three or more neighbors to see if a 3-star can be formed:
- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1: It has 7 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: It has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: It has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: It has 7 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: It has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 1 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 4 = 83. 
Hence, the final count of 3-stars is [83].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>
