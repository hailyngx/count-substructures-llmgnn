Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the set of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {6}

Next, let's calculate the possible 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 4 form a 3-star: <0, (4, 6)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars: <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 4] = 6.
