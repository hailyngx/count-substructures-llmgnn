Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Possible 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: Possible 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: Possible 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: Possible 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: Possible 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 14

So, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 9, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>
