Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 2: neighbor {4}
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 6}

Now we will check nodes with 3 or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:

- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: forms 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [3].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
