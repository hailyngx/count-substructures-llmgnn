Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 9
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
