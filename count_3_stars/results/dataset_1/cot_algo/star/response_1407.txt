Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 1, 4}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
