Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {3}

Node 6 and Node 8 both have 3 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 2.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)> 

So, the final answer is [2].
