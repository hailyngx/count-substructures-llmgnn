Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 3: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7}

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [16] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 16.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (8, 9, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
