Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes 4, 5, and 9 have 2, 2, and 3 neighbors respectively, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  (Less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  (Less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (Exactly 3 neighbors)

Therefore, there is only 1 3-star in this graph. Let's list it:

Total number of 3-stars: [1]
Unique 3-stars: <9, (4, 5, 7)>
