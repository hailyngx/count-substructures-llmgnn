Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: We have 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: We have 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5: We have 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8: We have 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
