Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up, there are a total of 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 2, 9)>, <0, (5, 2, 7)>, <0, (5, 2, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>.
