Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: Neighbor nodes = {2}  
Node 1: Neighbor nodes = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}  
Node 2: Neighbor nodes = {0, 1, 5, 6}  
Node 3: Neighbor nodes = {6}  
Node 4: Neighbor nodes = {8}  
Node 5: Neighbor nodes = {1, 2, 7, 9}  
Node 6: Neighbor nodes = {1, 2, 3, 7}  
Node 7: Neighbor nodes = {1, 5, 6, 9}  
Node 8: Neighbor nodes = {1, 4}  
Node 9: Neighbor nodes = {5, 7}  

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with {5, 7, 8}.  
Node 2 forms a 3-star with {5, 6, 7}.  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 7, 8)> and <2, (5, 6, 7)>.
