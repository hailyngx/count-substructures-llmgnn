Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with its given edges:

```
                1
                |
                0
                |
2 - 7         3 - 4
|     \       |
9      2     6
|       \   / |
8        9 9  3
              |
              8
```

Now, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 3
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 8

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
  
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [1].
The unique 3-star found is <9, (2, 6, 8)>.
