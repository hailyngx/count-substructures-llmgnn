Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The 3-star graph in this case can be found by examining the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors {3, 5, 6, 8, 9}.
- Node 1 has neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
- Node 2 has neighbors {1, 3, 4, 7}.
- Node 3 has neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}.
- Node 4 has neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}.
- Node 5 has neighbors {0, 4, 6}.
- Node 6 has neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}.
- Node 7 has neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}.
- Node 8 has neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7}.
- Node 9 has neighbors {0, 1}.

Looking at the neighbors of each node, we can see that only nodes 0, 1, and 3 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 20 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>
