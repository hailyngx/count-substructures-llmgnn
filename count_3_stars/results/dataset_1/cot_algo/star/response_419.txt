Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
        1 -- 2
        | \/ |
        | /\ |
        3 -- 5 -- 7
         \ |  \ |
           4    9
```

From the given information, we can determine the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars based on the neighbor sets:
- Node 1, 3-stars: [1]
  - <1, (2, 5, 7)>
  
- Node 2, 3-stars: [1]
  - <2, (1, 5, 9)>
  
- Node 5, 3-stars: [1]
  - <5, (0, 2, 6)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, and <5, (0, 2, 6)>.
