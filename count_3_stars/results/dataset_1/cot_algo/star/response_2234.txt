Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 forms three 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 3, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
