Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 8 (Degree: 4)
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (Degree: 7)
- Node 2: 3, 7, 9 (Degree: 3)
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7 (Degree: 5)
- Node 4: 1, 3 (Degree: 2)
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7 (Degree: 5)
- Node 6: 1, 5 (Degree: 2)
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 (Degree: 6)
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7, 9 (Degree: 4)
- Node 9: 1, 2, 7, 8 (Degree: 4)

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors to check for 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 35 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 83

Therefore, the final answer is [83] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
