Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: [2, 3, 4]
- Node 1: [4]
- Node 2: [0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
- Node 3: [0, 8]
- Node 4: [0, 1, 7]
- Node 5: [2, 9]
- Node 6: [2, 7, 8]
- Node 7: [2, 4, 6]
- Node 8: [2, 3, 6]
- Node 9: [2, 5]

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node. If a node has 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where n is the number of neighbors.

For this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 24, which we will represent as [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 0, 8)>
<7, (2, 0, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (2, 0, 7)>
<8, (2, 0, 9)>

We have 14 unique 3-stars in the graph.
