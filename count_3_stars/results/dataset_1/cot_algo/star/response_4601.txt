Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:  
0: {2, 5, 8}  
1: {2, 5, 8, 9}  
2: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9}  
3: {2, 4, 9}  
4: {3, 8, 9}  
5: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}  
6: {2}  
7: {5}  
8: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5}  
9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  

Based on the neighbor sets, the nodes that can form 3-stars are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = 20  
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [55]

Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>
