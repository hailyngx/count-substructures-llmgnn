Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 1, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 7

Now, we will look at nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [15]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>.
