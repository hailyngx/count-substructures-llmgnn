Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9 (Degree: 4)
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8 (Degree: 3)
- Node 2: 1, 5 (Degree: 2)
- Node 3: 6 (Degree: 1)
- Node 4: 6, 8, 9 (Degree: 3)
- Node 5: 2, 9 (Degree: 2)
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4 (Degree: 3)
- Node 7: 8 (Degree: 1)
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 7 (Degree: 4)
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5 (Degree: 3)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <9, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, we have a total of [10] 3-stars:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>
