Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 (degree = 5)
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6 (degree = 4)
- Node 2: 0 (degree = 1)
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 8 (degree = 4)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8 (degree = 5)
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 7 (degree = 4)
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 8 (degree = 4)
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8 (degree = 5)
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6, 7 (degree = 4)

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
