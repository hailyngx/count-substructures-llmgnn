Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes = 5
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes = 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes = 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes = 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes = 1, 3
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes = 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes = 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes = 5, 7
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes = 2, 3, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- For nodes 2 and 5:
  Inom{4}{3} = 4
- For nodes 3 and 9:
  Inom{4}{3} = 4
- For nodes 1, 7:
  Inom{3}{3} = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 1] = 9.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
