Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 29, so we will write this as [29].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 9, 4)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 9, 4)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <6, (5, 9, 4)>
- <6, (8, 9, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
