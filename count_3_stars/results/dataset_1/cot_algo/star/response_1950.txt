Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}

Now let's identify the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: [34]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 5, 9)>
<8, (7, 6, 9)>
