Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star. 
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>
