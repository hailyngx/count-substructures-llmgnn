Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edge list:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 27 \)

Thus, the final result is [27] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
