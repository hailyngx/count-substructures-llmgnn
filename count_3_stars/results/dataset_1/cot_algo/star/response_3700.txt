Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 3: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 6: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 9: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \([1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [14]\)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<3, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>,
<6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>
