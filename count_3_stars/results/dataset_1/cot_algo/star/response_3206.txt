Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: Neighbors = {5}, so no 3-star possible.
For node 1: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 9}, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>.
For node 2: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8}, so there are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 8)>.
For node 3: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7}, so there are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <3, (4, 6, 7)>.
For node 4: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9}, so there are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 9)>.
For node 5: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 8}, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>.
For node 6: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7}, so there are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 7)>.
For node 7: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6}, so there are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 6)>.
For node 8: Neighbors = {2, 5}, so no 3-star possible.
For node 9: Neighbors = {1, 4}, so no 3-star possible.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11, and they are listed as follows:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>.
