Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the number of 3-stars inside brackets [] is 58. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
