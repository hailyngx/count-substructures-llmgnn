Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Based on the calculations, there are a total of 2 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>

So, the final result is [2] with 3-star configurations <1, (0, 6, 9)> and <9, (1, 5, 8)>.
