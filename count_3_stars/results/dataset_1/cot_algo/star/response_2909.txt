Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

To determine the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 3, 5)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 5, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>.
