Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighborhood of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 3, 4, 5.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 3, 5, 6, 9.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 6, 9.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 3, 8.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 4, 8.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 6, 7.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 3, 4.

Now, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 5, 9 <4, (0, 5, 9)>.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 4, 9 <3, (0, 4, 9)>.

There are 2 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [2].
