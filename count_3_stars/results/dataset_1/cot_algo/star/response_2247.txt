Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 8, 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 10 + 56 + 1 = 69 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [69] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (2, 7, 8)>
