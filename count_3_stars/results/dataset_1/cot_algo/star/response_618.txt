Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 8} 
Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 6}
Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 9}

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars: <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>.
