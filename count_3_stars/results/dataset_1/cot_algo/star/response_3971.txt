Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 1
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7
- Node 9: 1

Next, we'll check the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3, 5, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Since node 1 has 4 neighbors, we calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>.
