Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 16

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16]. 

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
