Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (8, 9, 5)>
<3, (8, 9, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
