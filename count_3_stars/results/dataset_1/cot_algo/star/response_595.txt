Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {1, 3, 5}
Node 1: {0, 4, 8}
Node 2: {4}
Node 3: {0, 4, 5}
Node 4: {1, 2, 3}
Node 5: {0, 3}
Node 6: {9}
Node 8: {1, 9}
Node 9: {6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 5)>
Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 8)>
Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 5)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 3)>
Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
