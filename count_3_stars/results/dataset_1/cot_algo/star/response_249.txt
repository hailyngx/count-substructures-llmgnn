Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 5, 6
Node 1: 4, 7, 8
Node 2: 4, 7, 8
Node 3: 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 4: 1, 2
Node 5: 0, 3, 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 8
Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
Node 9: 3, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
These 3-stars are: 
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is [4].
