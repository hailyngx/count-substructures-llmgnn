Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 5)>, <3, (6, 9, 5)>, <3, (8, 9, 5)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 5)>, <3, (6, 9, 5)>, <3, (8, 9, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>.
