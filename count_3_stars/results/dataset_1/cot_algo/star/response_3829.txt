Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbor {6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 8}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 9}.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 8, 9}.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>.
