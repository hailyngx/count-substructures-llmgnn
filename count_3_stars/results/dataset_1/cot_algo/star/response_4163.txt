Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format for better visualization:

0: [1, 5, 8, 9]
1: [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
2: [1, 3, 4, 8]
3: [2, 4]
4: [1, 2, 3, 6]
5: [0, 1, 6, 8]
6: [1, 4, 5]
7: [1]
8: [0, 2, 5, 9]
9: [0, 8]

Now let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 2, 4
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 1
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [40] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
