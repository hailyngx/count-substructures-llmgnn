Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 20 + 10 = 40.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
