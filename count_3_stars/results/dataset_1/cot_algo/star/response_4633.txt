Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can find the 3-stars present in the graph as follows:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5.
2. Node 1 has neighbors: 6.
3. Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8.
4. Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 4, 8.
5. Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 8.
6. Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7.
7. Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 5.
8. Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 4, 5.
9. Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 17 ⟦17⟧

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
