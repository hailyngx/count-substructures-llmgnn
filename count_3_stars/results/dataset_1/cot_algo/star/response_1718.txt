Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 7}

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, node 2, and node 3 each have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9, which we will represent inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>.
