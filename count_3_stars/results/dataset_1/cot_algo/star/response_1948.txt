Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6
- Node 9: 4, 6

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it will form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it will form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it will form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it will form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
