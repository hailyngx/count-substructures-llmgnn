Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 (Degree = 5)
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9 (Degree = 5)
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5 (Degree = 3)
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 9 (Degree = 4)
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8 (Degree = 3)
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 9 (Degree = 4)
- Node 6: 1, 7 (Degree = 2)
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8 (Degree = 5)
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7, 9 (Degree = 4)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8 (Degree = 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 52

So, there are 52 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 9)>
3. <3, (1, 5, 9)>
4. <5, (0, 3, 9)>
5. <7, (0, 1, 8)>
6. <9, (0, 1, 5)>
