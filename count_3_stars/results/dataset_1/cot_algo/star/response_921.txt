Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 3, and 9
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 2, and 4
- Node 2: neighbors are 1, 7, and 9
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 4, and 9
- Node 4: neighbors are 1, 3, 6, and 8
- Node 5: neighbors are 6 and 8
- Node 6: neighbors are 4 and 5
- Node 7: neighbors are 2 and 8
- Node 8: neighbors are 4, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 9: neighbors are 0, 2, 3, and 8

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 1+1+1+4+4+4 = 15 3-stars.

Therefore, the result is [15] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (6, 8, 5)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (7, 9, 2)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>
- <9, (3, 8, 2)>
- <9, (8, 2, 7)>
- <9, (2, 7, 3)>
