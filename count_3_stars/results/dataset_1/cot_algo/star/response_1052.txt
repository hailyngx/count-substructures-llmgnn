Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star (with neighbors 4, 6, 7)
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star (with neighbors 4, 9, 3)
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star (with neighbors 2, 6, 8)
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star (with neighbors 0, 4, 7)
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star (with neighbors 0, 4, 9)
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star (with neighbors 0, 4, 6)
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star (with neighbors 0, 2, 7)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 9, 3)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>
