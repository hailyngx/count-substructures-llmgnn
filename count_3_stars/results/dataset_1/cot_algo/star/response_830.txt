Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- No other node has 3 or more neighbors, so no more 3-stars can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 20] = 22. The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (5, 8, 9)>
