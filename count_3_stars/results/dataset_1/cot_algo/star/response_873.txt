Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes: <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes: <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes: <6, (3, 7, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [6].
