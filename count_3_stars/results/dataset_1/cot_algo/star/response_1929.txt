Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 (6 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 5: 9 (1 neighbor)
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5 (4 neighbors)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
