Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {7}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {2, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {5}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with leaves (1, 7, 9), (1, 3, 7), (1, 3, 9), and (3, 7, 9).
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star with leaves (0, 4, 8).
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, and they are:
<5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>.
