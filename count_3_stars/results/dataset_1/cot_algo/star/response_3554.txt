Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 2, 8
Node 1 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 7
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7
Node 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 9
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 7 neighbors: 1, 3
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 6
Node 9 neighbors: 4, 5

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 forms 2 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
