Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in adjacency list format:

0: [3, 7, 8, 9]
1: [2, 9]
2: [1, 5, 6]
3: [0, 7]
4: [6, 7]
5: [2, 8]
6: [2, 4]
7: [0, 3, 4]
8: [0, 5, 9]
9: [0, 1, 8]

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>.
