Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbor {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 7)>

Count of 3-stars = 4

Therefore, the final result is [4].
