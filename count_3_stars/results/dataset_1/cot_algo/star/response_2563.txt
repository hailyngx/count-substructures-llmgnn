Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 3 and 6
- Node 1: neighbors are 6 and 8
- Node 2: neighbor is 5
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 5, and 8
- Node 4: neighbors are 5, 6, and 7
- Node 5: neighbors are 2, 3, 4, and 7
- Node 6: neighbors are 0, 1, 4, and 9
- Node 7: neighbors are 4, 5, and 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 1 and 3
- Node 9: neighbors are 6 and 7

Now, we will find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 forms four 3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
