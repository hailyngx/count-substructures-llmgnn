Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Summing up all 3-stars, we have a total of [1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 38 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [38].
