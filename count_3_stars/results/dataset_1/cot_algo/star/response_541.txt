Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = [14]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (6, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (2, 8, 3)>
- <9, (3, 8, 2)>
