Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can determine the 3-star structures in the graph following the steps outlined at the beginning.

### Neighbor Sets:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 8}

### 3-star Structures:
- Node 0 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: 
  - <0, (1, 2, 3)>
  - <0, (1, 2, 8)>
  - <0, (1, 3, 8)>
  - <0, (2, 3, 8)>

- Node 2 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: 
  - <2, (0, 3, 8)>
  - <2, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <2, (3, 6, 8)>
  - <2, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 7 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: 
  - <7, (5, 6, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 1] = 9, and the unique 3-star structures found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
