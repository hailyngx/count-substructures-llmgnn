Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 3}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4}

Now, we will check each node that has 3 or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars each node is part of:

- Node 1 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
  - <1, (2, 5, 7)>
  
- Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  - <2, (1, 7, 9)>
  - <2, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <2, (1, 7, 8)>
  - <2, (6, 7, 9)>
  
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
  - <5, (1, 4, 7)>

- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  - <7, (1, 2, 5)>
  - <7, (1, 2, 3)>
  - <7, (1, 5, 7)>
  - <7, (2, 3, 5)>

Adding them up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 10, and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>.
