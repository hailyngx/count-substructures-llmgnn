Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information about the graph, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6
- Node 9: 4, 7

Next, let's calculate the 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].
