Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 1: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 4

Next, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 1 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 4) = 5 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [5], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
