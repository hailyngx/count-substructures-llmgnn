Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, 7, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

For nodes with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 16]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
