Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as follows:

(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 7),
(1, 0), (1, 3),
(2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7),
(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 7),
(5, 0), (5, 2),
(6, 2), (6, 3),
(7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 9),
(9, 7).

Let's determine the 3-star structures in this graph:

Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7. It forms <0, (1, 3, 5)> and <0, (1, 3, 7)>.
Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 3. It doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 2 has neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7. It forms <2, (3, 5, 6)> and <2, (3, 5, 7)>.
Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7. It forms <3, (0, 2, 6)> and <3, (0, 2, 7)>.
Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 2. It doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 3. It doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 9. It forms <7, (0, 2, 9)>.
Node 9 has neighbors: 7. It doesn't form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, and <3, (0, 2, 7)>.
