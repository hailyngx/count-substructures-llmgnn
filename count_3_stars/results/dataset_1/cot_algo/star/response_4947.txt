Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by listing the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 5}
Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
Node 2: {1, 6}
Node 3: {4, 6, 8, 9}
Node 4: {0, 3}
Node 5: {0, 1}
Node 6: {2, 3, 7}
Node 7: {1, 6, 8, 9}
Node 8: {3, 7, 9}
Node 9: {1, 3, 7, 8}

Now, we look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to identify 3-stars:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 22, which we will represent as [22].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<1, (0, 5, 9)>  
<1, (0, 7, 9)>  
<1, (2, 7, 9)>  
<1, (5, 7, 9)>  
<3, (4, 6, 9)>  
<7, (6, 8, 9)>  

These are the 3-star configurations present in the graph.
