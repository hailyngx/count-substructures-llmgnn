Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 4: 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total so far: 1
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total so far: 2
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total so far: 3
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Total so far: 7
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total so far: 11

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 11. 

Therefore, the answer is [11]. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
