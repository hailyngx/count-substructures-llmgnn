Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7
Node 2: 6, 8
Node 3: 1, 9
Node 4: 5
Node 5: 4, 6, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 2, 6
Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 4 + 10 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 3)>
<1, (6, 3, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 9, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
