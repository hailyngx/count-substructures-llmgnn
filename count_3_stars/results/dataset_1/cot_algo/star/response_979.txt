Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {3, 4}
- Node 7: {2, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 4}

Next, let's identify the 3-star clusters:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. However, we have already counted 2 of them (0, 4, 9) and (4, 6, 9) in the previous steps. So, we need to find the remaining ones:
    - <3, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <3, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <3, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <3, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <3, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <3, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <3, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <3, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 6)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <3, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <3, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3 [20].
