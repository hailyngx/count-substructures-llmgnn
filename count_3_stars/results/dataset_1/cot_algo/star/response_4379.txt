Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 1: 4, 5
Node 2: 0, 3, 4
Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 4, 9
Node 8: 0
Node 9: 0, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs.

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 45. 

Therefore, there are 45 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as:

[45]
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>
