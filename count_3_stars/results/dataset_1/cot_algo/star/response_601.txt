Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-star patterns:

For Node 2: 
- 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 5 -> <2, (0, 3, 5)>

For Node 4: 
- 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 9 -> <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>

For Node 5: 
- 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 -> <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars:
[7] <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>
