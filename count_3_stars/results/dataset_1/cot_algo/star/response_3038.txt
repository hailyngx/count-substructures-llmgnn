Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {}
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2}
Node 5: Neighbors {2, 7, 8}
Node 6: Neighbors {7}
Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6}
Node 8: Neighbors {2, 5}

Next, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star possible
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars possible
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star possible
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star possible

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 1 = 12, which we will represent within brackets as [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 0)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
