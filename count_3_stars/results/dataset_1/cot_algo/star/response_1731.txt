Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 3, 4, and 6
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 3, and 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 1, 6, and 7
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 2 and 4
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0 and 3
- Node 7: Neighbors are 3, 4, 8, and 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 7, and 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 34

So, the final answer is [34] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
