Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
