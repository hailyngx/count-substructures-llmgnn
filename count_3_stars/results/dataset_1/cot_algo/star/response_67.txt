Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's map out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 8
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 7

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 7, 9.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 5, 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (7, 9)> and <4, (5, 9)>.
