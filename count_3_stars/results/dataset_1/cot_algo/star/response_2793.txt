Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: neighbor {9}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 4, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 8, 9)>
- <8, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (8, 9, 9)>
