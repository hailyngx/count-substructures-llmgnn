Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 5
Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 8
Node 3: 2, 5
Node 4: 2, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
Node 6: 5, 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 25 3-stars. 

So, the final result is [25], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (7, 6, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 5)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 0)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 0, 7)>
<8, (5, 0, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 0)>
<8, (7, 0, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 0)>
<9, (4, 7, 0)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>
