Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph contains the following nodes and their neighbors:

Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 4
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 6
Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 3
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 9: 4, 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [70] \)

Unique 3-stars in the graph:
