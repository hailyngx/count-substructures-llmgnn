Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

For each node, let's find their neighbors:
- Node 0: {5, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
