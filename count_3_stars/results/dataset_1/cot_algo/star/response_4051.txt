Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, and <8, (0, 7, 9)>.
