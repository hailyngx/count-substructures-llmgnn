Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [1 7 9], [7 0 9]
- Node 2: [3 4 7]
- Node 3: [2 4 7], [4 3 7], [3 7 9], [3 8 9]
- Node 7: [0 2 3], [2 3 4], [3 8 9], [3 9 5]
- Node 8: [6 7 9]
- Node 9: [0 3 5], [3 5 9], [0 7 9], [7 9 8]

Finally, counting all unique 3-stars gives us a total of [16]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 2, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <0, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 9, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <7, 9, 8>.
