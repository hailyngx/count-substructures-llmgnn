Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 4, 6}
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
- <9, (6, 7, 4)>
- <9, (6, 8, 4)>
