Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0

Next, we will identify the nodes with at least three neighbors: Node 0, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8. 

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26], and the unique 3-stars are:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
