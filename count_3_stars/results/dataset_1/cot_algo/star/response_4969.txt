Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 5
Node 1: 2, 8, 9
Node 2: 1, 4, 6
Node 3: 5, 9
Node 4: 2, 5
Node 5: 0, 3, 4
Node 6: 2, 9
Node 7: 9
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 7

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 7 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
