Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {1, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Now, let's check for each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:
- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 1: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 2: It has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)> 
- Node 4: It has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 7: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 8: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 12. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
