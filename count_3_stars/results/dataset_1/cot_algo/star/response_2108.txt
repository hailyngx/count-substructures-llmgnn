Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 2

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: 0 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 0 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 13 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 13.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
