Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 4)
- Node 1: 1 neighbor (Node 4)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (Nodes 3 and 4)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (Nodes 2, 7, 8, and 4)
- Node 4: 6 neighbors (Nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 9, and 4)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (Nodes 7, 8, and 9)
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (Node 4)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (Nodes 3, 5, and 9)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (Nodes 3 and 5)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (Nodes 4, 5, and 9)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 7, 8)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 2, 6)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (2, 7, 8)> and <4, (1, 2, 6)>.
