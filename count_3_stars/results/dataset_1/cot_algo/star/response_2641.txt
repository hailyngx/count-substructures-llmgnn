Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 2), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 7), (5, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 4)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1: Neighbors {2, 7, 8} => 1 3-star formed
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 9} => 1 3-star formed
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 8} => 1 3-star formed
Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7} => 1 3-star formed
Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 4} => 1 3-star formed

Total number of 3-stars = 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>
