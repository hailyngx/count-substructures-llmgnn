Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star
- Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star
- Node 5: <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 6: <6 (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 8, 2)>
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star
- Node 9: inom{0}{3} = 0 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [3].
The unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, and <7, (4, 8, 2)>.
