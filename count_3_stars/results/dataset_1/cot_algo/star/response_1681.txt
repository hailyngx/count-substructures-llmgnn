Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7

Next, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 and Node 9 both have 6 neighbors. Hence, they can form 6 choose 3 = 20 unique 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 40.
