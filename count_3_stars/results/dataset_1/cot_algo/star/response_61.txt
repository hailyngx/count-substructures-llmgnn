Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7, 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 1 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- All other nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4] = [12] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, (2, 7, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 7)>
4. <6, (1, 4, 9)>
