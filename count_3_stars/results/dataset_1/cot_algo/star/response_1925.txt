Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's first find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 1: {3, 6, 9}
Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 7}
Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 7}
Node 5: {0, 2, 4}
Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 8}
Node 7: {0, 2, 4}
Node 8: {0, 6, 9}
Node 9: {1, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 4)>, <0, (2, 7, 5)>, 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 7, 5)>, <0, (4, 7, 2)>, 
<0, (4, 7, 5)>, <0, (4, 2, 5)>, <0, (4, 2, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>,
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 4)>, <0, (5, 7, 6)>

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars:
<3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>,
<3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>,
<3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars:
<6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>

Adding them up: 
Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 = 34
So, the final answer is [34].
