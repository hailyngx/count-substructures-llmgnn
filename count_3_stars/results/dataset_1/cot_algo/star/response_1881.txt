Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors: 5
- Node 1: Neighbors: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: Neighbors: 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors: 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors: 6, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors: 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with (2, 4, 6)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 9)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with (2, 5, 9)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with (0, 6, 9)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with (1, 5, 9)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with (2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 8), and (5, 6, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6, and they are:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 8)>
