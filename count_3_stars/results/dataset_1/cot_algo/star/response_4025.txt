Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {2, 5, 7} <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars with nodes {1, 4, 6} <3, (1, 4, 6)> and {6, 7, 0} <3, (6, 7, 0)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {7, 8, 9} <6, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
