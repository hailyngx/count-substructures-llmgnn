Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1+1+1 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
