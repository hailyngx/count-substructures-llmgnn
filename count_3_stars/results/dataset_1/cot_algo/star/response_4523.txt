Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars and list them, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 8}
Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6}
Node 4: Neighbor {8}
Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6}
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
Node 7: Neighbors {6, 9}
Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
Node 9: Neighbor {7}

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>
