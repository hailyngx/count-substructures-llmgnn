Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 2 -- 1       8 -- 9
|         |       |
4         5       | 
          |       |
          7       |
          |       |
          3       |
                   6
```

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 8). So, it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 7). So, it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5, 6, 7, 9, and 3 have only 1 neighbor and thus cannot form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
