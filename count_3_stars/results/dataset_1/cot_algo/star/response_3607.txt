Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 6, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 6
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed from each of them:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (8, 9, 1)>
<9, (3, 0, 1)>
