Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 0
Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 4: 1, 3, 9
Node 5: 3, 7
Node 7: 3, 5
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's check how many 3-star graphs can be formed:

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star graphs.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs is 10 + 1 = 11.

The unique 3-star graphs are:
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs is [11].
