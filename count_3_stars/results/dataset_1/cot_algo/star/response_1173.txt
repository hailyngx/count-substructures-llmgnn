Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 2, 7

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 1 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 6 forms 2 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 5)> and <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 0 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5. So, the answer is [5].
