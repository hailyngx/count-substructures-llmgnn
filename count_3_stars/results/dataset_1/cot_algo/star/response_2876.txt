Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {2, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Next, we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: ${2 \choose 3} = 0$ (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: ${2 \choose 3} = 0$ (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: ${2 \choose 3} = 0$ (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ (<0, 1, 5>)
- Node 5: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ (<3, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>)
- Node 8: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ (<1, 5, 8>, <7, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 9>)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Thus, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [9]. The unique 3-stars are <0, 1, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <7, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 9>.
