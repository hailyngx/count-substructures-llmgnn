Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {3}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 7} <1, (5, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 7} <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 7} <4, (6, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 8} <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 7} <6, (4, 7)>
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars:
  - with neighbors {1, 2, 4} <7, (1, 2, 4)>
  - with neighbors {2, 4, 6} <7, (2, 4, 6)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [6].
