Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17 \) []

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 1)>
- <0, (2, 1, 7)>
- <0, (4, 1, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 1)>
- <0, (7, 1, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (4, 1, 7)>
- <1, (7, 9, 5)>
- <3, (2, 7, 4)>
- <4, (3, 5, 1)>
- <7, (1, 8, 0)>
- <7, (3, 0, 8)>
- <7, (3, 0, 1)>
- <7, (3, 1, 8)>
