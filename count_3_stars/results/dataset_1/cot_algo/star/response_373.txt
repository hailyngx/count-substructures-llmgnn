Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 7
- Node 9: 5

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 4 3-stars formed: <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 3)>

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 4 3-stars formed: <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 4, 7)>

Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 1 3-star formed: <4, (0, 5, 6)>

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 4 3-stars formed: <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 4, 9)>

Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 4 3-stars formed: <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 4, 7)>, <6, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 1 3-star formed: <7, (1, 6, 8)>

Summing up all the 3-stars, we have a total of 18 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [18].
