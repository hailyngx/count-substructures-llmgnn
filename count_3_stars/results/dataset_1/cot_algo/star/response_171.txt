Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 7}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, which are Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 7. For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 5:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14, so the final answer is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
