Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors [4]
- Node 1: Neighbors [2, 3, 8]
- Node 2: Neighbors [1, 9]
- Node 3: Neighbors [1, 9]
- Node 4: Neighbors [0, 8]
- Node 5: Neighbors [7]
- Node 6: Neighbors [8]
- Node 7: Neighbors [5]
- Node 8: Neighbors [1, 4, 6]
- Node 9: Neighbors [2, 3]

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors [2, 3, 8]: <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors [1, 4, 6]: <8, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
