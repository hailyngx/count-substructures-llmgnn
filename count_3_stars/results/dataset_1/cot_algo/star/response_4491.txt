Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 3, 7 (degree = 3)
- Node 1: Neighbor is 0 (degree = 1)
- Node 2: Neighbor is 3 (degree = 1)
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 7 (degree = 3)
- Node 4: Neighbor is 5 (degree = 1)
- Node 5: Neighbors are 4, 8 (degree = 2)
- Node 6: Neighbors are 7, 8 (degree = 2)
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 8, 9 (degree = 5)
- Node 8: Neighbors are 5, 6, 7 (degree = 3)
- Node 9: Neighbor is 7 (degree = 1)

Next, we find all the 3-stars using the nodes with a degree of 3 or more:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, 7: <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, 7: <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, 6: <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, 7: <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of 4 3-stars in the given graph, which can be denoted as [] = 4.
