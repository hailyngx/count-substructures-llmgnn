Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {3, 4}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <8, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, and <8, (0, 3, 4)>.
