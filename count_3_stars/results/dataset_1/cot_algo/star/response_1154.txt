Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 6 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 4, 6, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 2: 4, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0 (1 neighbor)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 (6 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: 1, 6 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 4, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5 (3 neighbors)

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 5)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (9, 4, 5)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (9, 4, 8)>
<5, (9, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (9, 5, 4)>
