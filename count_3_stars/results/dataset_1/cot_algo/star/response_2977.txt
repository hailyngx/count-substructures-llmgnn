Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5}

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, and Node 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 1, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 2, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 6, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 9, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [27] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
