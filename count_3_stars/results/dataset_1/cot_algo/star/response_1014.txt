Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Applying the rules for a 3-star graph to the given graph:

1. Node 0 has neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}.
2. Node 1 has neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8}.
3. Node 2 has neighbors {5, 8, 9}.
4. Node 3 has neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7, 9}.
5. Node 4 has neighbors {6, 9}.
6. Node 5 has neighbors {0, 2, 3, 7}.
7. Node 6 has neighbors {0, 4, 7, 9}.
8. Node 7 has neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6}.
9. Node 8 has neighbors {1, 2}.
10. Node 9 has neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}.

Now, checking for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
