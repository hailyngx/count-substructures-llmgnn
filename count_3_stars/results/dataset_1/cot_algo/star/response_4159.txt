Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 0, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3
- Node 9: 2, 5, 6

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [31], and the unique 3-stars formed are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 9, 6)>
