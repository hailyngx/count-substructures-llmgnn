Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 8, 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2 neighbors: 6, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 4 neighbor: 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 1, 6
- Node 6 neighbors: 2, 5, 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 6, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that could potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 1, 6, and 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [4 + 4 + 4] = [12] \]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
