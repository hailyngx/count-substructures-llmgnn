Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. Node 0 has neighbors {6, 8, 9}.
   Number of 3-stars with Node 0 as the center: [1]
   Unique 3-star: <0, (6, 8, 9)>

2. Node 2 has neighbors {3, 7}.
   Node 3 has neighbors {2, 5, 9}.
   Number of 3-stars with Node 2 as the center: [1]
   Unique 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 5)>

3. Node 3 has neighbors {2, 5, 9}.
   Number of 3-stars with Node 3 as the center: [1]
   Unique 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 9)>

4. Node 5 has neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8}.
   Number of 3-stars with Node 5 as the center: [1]
   Unique 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
