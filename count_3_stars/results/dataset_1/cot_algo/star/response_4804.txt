Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <0, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
    - <1, (2, 3, 6)>

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
    - <2, (1, 6, 7)>

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
    - <3, (1, 4, 8)>

- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it does not form any 3-star.

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
    - <5, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <5, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (6, 8, 0)>

- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. Due to space constraints, we won't list all of them here.

- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
    - <7, (0, 2, 8)>

- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
    - <8, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <8, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <8, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <8, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <8, (5, 6, 7)>

- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3, so it does not form any 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars found: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].
