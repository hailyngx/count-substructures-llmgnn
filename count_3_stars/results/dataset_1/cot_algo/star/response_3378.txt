Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 7, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 2}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 5, as indicated by []. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
