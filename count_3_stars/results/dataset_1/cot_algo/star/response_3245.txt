Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 3}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 0 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 9: 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 7, 4)>
<9, (2, 7, 4)>
