Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: Can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: Can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: Can form a 3-star with nodes 7, 8
- Node 4: Cannot form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors
- Node 7: Can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: Can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 3, and another 3-star with nodes 7, 4, 2

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 2 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2] = [6]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, 4, 6, 8> 
- <2, 4, 6, 8>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <7, 2, 3, 8>
- <8, 1, 2, 3>
- <8, 7, 4, 2>
