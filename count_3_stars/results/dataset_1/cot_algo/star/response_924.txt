Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {5, 8}
Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5}
Node 2: {1, 5, 8, 9}
Node 3: {1}
Node 4: {1, 8, 9}
Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
Node 6: {7, 8}
Node 7: {5, 6, 8}
Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: {2, 4, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors. 

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, therefore it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 7 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

Summing these up, we have a total of \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 35] = 54 \) 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>.
