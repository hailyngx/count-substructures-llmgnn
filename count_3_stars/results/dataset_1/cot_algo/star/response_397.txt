Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [34] \)

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 3, 5)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (6, 4, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 0, 3)>
- <4, (5, 3, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 0, 6)>
- <6, (4, 1, 7)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 9)>
