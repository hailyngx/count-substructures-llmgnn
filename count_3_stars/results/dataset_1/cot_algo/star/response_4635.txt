Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 has neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
    - Inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars with node 0
- Node 1 has neighbors {0, 2, 3, 7}
    - Inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 1
- Node 2 has neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7}
    - Inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 2
- Node 3 has neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
    - Inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars with node 3
- Node 4 has neighbors {0, 5, 6}
    - No 3-star formed with node 4
- Node 5 has neighbors {4, 8}
    - No 3-star formed with node 5
- Node 6 has neighbors {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
    - Inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with node 6
- Node 7 has neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
    - Inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with node 7
- Node 8 has neighbors {5, 6}
    - No 3-star formed with node 8
- Node 9 has neighbors {0, 3, 6}
    - No 3-star formed with node 9

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 68. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68]. 

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
