Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we'll first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 7: {1, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 7}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 8 3-stars, which are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
