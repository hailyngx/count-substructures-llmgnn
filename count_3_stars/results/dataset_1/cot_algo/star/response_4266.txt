Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 5 neighbors
- Node 2, 5 neighbors
- Node 3, 3 neighbors
- Node 4, 3 neighbors
- Node 5, 4 neighbors
- Node 6, 6 neighbors
- Node 7, 3 neighbors
- Node 9, 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [10 + 10 + 4 + 20] = 44 \]

Finally, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <4, 6, 9>
