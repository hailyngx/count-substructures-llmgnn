Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
   0 --- 2
   |      |
   4 --- 1 --- 6
   |         /   
   7 --- 8  
       |
       3 --- 9
```

Let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {3, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
  - <0, (4, 7, 1)>

- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
  - <1, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <1, (2, 4, 8)>
  - <1, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <1, (4, 7, 8)>
  - <1, (0, 4, 7)>
  - <1, (0, 4, 8)>
  - <1, (0, 7, 8)>
  - <1, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (0, 7, 4)>
  - <1, (0, 7, 9)>

- Node 3: Doesn't have 3 or more neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.

- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
  - <4, (0, 1, 7)>
  - <4, (0, 1, 8)>
  - <4, (0, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (1, 7, 8)>

- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
  - <7, (0, 1, 4)>
  - <7, (0, 1, 9)>
  - <7, (0, 4, 9)>
  - <7, (1, 4, 9)>

- Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
  - <8, (1, 3, 4)>

- Node 9: Doesn't have 3 or more neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.

Adding up the 3-stars found:
\[ [1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [20] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20.
