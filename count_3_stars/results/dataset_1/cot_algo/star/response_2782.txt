Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars in this given graph, we can first identify the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 1: {2}
Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
Node 3: {2, 6}
Node 4: {2}
Node 5: {0, 9}
Node 6: {0, 2, 3}
Node 7: {0, 2, 9}
Node 8: {0}
Node 9: {5, 7}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the final result is [15] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
