Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {3, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so there's 1 3-star <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, so there's 1 3-star <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 2: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18, so [18]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>.
