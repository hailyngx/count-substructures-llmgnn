Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor nodes - 5, Total neighbors = 1
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes - 7, Total neighbors = 1
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes - 3, 6, 7, Total neighbors = 3
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes - 2, 6, Total neighbors = 2
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes - 8, 9, Total neighbors = 2
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes - 0, Total neighbors = 1
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes - 2, 3, 8, Total neighbors = 3
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes - 1, 2, Total neighbors = 2
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes - 4, 6, Total neighbors = 2
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes - 4, Total neighbors = 1

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars associated with them:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star. The 3-star is: <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star. The 3-star is: <6, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are: <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>.
