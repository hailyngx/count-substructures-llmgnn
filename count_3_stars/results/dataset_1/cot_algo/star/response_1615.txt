Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and determine the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
