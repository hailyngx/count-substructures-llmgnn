Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 1] = 9 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
