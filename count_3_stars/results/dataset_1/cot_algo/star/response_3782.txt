Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: does not form a 3-star as it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 2: does not form a 3-star as it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3: <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 6, 8)> <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: does not form a 3-star as it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6: does not form a 3-star as it has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: does not form a 3-star as it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8: does not form a 3-star as it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9: does not form a 3-star as it has 4 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, and <4, (1, 6, 8)> <4, (1, 7, 9)>.
