Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list to better visualize the connections:

0: 4, 9
1: 3, 4, 9
2: 4, 5, 8
3: 1
4: 0, 1, 2
5: 2, 7
7: 5
8: 2
9: 0, 1

Now, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 4, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 3, 4, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 4, 5, 8
Node 3 neighbors: 1
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2
Node 5 neighbors: 2, 7
Node 7 neighbors: 5
Node 8 neighbors: 2
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 1

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4)>, and <2, (5, 8)>.
