Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-star subgraphs in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 2, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 7: neighbors {0}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 4, 5}

Next, we identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors, as these are the potential centers of 3-star subgraphs:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of these, which is 10 + 4 + 1 = 15. Therefore, the answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 9)>
