Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can analyze the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of possible 3-stars:

- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 
   - <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
   - <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
   - <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, and <6, (1, 4, 7)>.
