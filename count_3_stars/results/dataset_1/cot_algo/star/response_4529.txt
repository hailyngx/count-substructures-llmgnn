Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbor {7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbor {2}
- Node 5: Neighbor {2, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <2, (3, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (3, 5, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 6, 7)>
4. <2, (3, 7, 8)>
5. <2, (4, 5, 6)>
6. <2, (4, 5, 9)>
7. <2, (5, 6, 7)>
8. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
9. <2, (6, 7, 8)>
10. <2, (6, 7, 9)>
11. <3, (2, 6, 7)>
12. <3, (2, 6, 8)>
13. <3, (2, 6, 9)>
14. <3, (2, 7, 8)>
15. <3, (5, 6, 7)>
16. <3, (5, 6, 8)>
17. <3, (7, 8, 9)>
18. <6, (0, 3, 5)>
19. <6, (0, 3, 7)>
20. <6, (0, 5, 7)>
21. <6, (2, 3, 5)>
22. <6, (2, 3, 7)>
23. <6, (2, 5, 7)>
24. <6, (3, 5, 7)>
25. <7, (2, 3, 6)>
