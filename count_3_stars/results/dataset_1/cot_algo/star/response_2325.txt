Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We first need to determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 8
- Node 5: 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 7, 8

Now we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: [&#92;]
- Node 2: [&#92;]
- Node 3: [&#92;]
- Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 5: [&#92;]
- Node 6: [&#92;]
- Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 9: [&#92;]

There are a total of 2 3-stars in this graph, so the final result is [2].
