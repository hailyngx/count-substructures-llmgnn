Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: (no neighbors)
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 0 3-star
- Node 1: 0 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 0 3-star
- Node 6: 0 3-star
- Node 7: 0 3-star
- Node 8: 0 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 3, and they are:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
