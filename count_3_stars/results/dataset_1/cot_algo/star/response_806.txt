Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 4, 7
Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 2: 5, 9
Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 8
Node 4: 0
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6
Node 6: 1, 5, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 8
Node 8: 3, 7
Node 9: 2, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3C3 = 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
