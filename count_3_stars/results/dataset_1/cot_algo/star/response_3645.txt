Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 8
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 6: 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Next, we check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 8: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 2 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 4, 8>
- <8, 6, 9> 

So, the final answer is: [2], and the unique 3-stars are: <0, 2, 4, 8>, <8, 6, 9>.
