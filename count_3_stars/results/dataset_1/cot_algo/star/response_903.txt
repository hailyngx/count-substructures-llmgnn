Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 9) = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, and <9, (4, 5, 6)>.
