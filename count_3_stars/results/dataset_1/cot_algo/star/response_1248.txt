Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4, 8, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.

For the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30, which we represent inside brackets as [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
