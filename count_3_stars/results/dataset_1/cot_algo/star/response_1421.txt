Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}
Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 8}
Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4}
Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5, 7}
Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6}
Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5}
Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5}

Now, we can determine the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 8)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 8)>
Node 4 forms three 3-stars: <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (8, 5, 9)>
Node 5 forms two 3-stars: <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
