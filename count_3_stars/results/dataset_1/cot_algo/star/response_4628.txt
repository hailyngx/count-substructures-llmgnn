Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 6, 8, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 4, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 9
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 2, 4
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.

There are a total of 4 3-stars, which can be represented as follows:

[4]
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
