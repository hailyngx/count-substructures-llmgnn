Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 1, 8
Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 8
Node 2: 4, 5, 8
Node 3: 8
Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 5: 2, 4, 6
Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 8
Node 7: 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 6
Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 8)>
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (1, 5, 8)>
So, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 5 + 1] = 7. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>
