Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {7}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1, 3-stars: 1
- Node 4, 3-stars: 1
- Node 5, 3-stars: 1
- Node 7, 3-stars: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 9, 3-stars: 1

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 35 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 9) = 39

Therefore, the final answer is [39].

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>
