Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 3}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {2, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors (Nodes 2, 3, 4, 8, 9). For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of possible 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36] and the unique 3-star configurations are:
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
