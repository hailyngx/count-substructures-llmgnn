Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 3, 6
Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 6
Node 4: 0, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8
Node 6: 2, 3
Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 8
Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 7
Node 9: 0, 1

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0: 6 neighbors -> 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
Node 1: 6 neighbors -> 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
Node 5: 5 neighbors -> 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 8: 4 neighbors -> 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is [54] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
