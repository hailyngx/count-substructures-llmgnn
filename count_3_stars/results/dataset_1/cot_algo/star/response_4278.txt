Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1 and 2
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: neighbors are 0 and 5
- Node 3: neighbors are 5 and 9
- Node 4: neighbors are 1 and 8
- Node 5: neighbors are 2, 3, and 8
- Node 6: neighbors are 1 and 8
- Node 7: neighbors are 1 and 8
- Node 8: neighbors are 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: neighbors are 1 and 3

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 = 14, so we write this as  [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
