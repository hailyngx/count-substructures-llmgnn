Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 7

Now, we need to find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 9, 5)>, <0, (7, 9, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>.
