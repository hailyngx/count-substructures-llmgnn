Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will represent the given graph in adjacency list form:
- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Next, we will find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 1 neighbor
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 8 and Node 9, there are enough neighbors to form 3-stars. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for both.

For Node 8:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>

For Node 9:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 = 14
Therefore, the final answer is [14].
