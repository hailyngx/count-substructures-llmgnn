Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (7, 4, 5)>, <9, (7, 2, 4)>, <9, (7, 2, 5)>, <9, (7, 4, 5)>
