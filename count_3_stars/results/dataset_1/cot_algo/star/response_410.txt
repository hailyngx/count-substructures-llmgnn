Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: Neighbors are 4 and 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 4, 5, and 6
- Node 3: Neighbors are 4, 5, and 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, and 6
- Node 5: Neighbors are 2, 3, 6, and 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 4, 5, and 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 5 and 6
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1 and 3

We can see that only nodes 2, 3, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, so the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
