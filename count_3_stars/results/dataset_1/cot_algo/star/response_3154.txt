Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 1: neighbor {4}
- Node 2: neighbor {8}
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final result is [6] and the unique 3-stars are <(3, 4, 6), (4, 0, 1), (4, 3, 6), (4, 3, 5), (4, 6, 9), (6, 4, 0)>.
