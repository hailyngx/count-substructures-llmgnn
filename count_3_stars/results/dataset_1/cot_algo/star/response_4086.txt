Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6
- Node 9: 0, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 6, and 8 have 5 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>.
