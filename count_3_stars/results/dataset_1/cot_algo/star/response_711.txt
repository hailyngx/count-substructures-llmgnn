Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9} 
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (since it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (since it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (since it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars (since it has 7 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars (since it has 6 neighbors)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 20] = 69.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>    

These 7 unique 3-star configurations complete the 3-star graph.
