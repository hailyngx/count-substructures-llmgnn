Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we have the following neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Node 8 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars. Since this exceeds the total number of edges in the graph, it's not feasible to form all possible 3-stars. Instead, we should focus on finding unique 3-stars based on the given edges. 

After careful analysis, we find that the only 3-star in this graph is with Node 8 as the center, and its three leaves are nodes 1, 5, and 9. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1], and the unique 3-star is <8, (1, 5, 9)>.
