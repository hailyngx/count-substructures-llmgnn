Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list to represent the graph:

Node 0: [2]
Node 1: [5]
Node 2: [0, 5]
Node 3: [8, 9]
Node 5: [1, 2, 7]
Node 7: [5, 9]
Node 8: [3]
Node 9: [3, 7]

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph using the method mentioned earlier.

Node 2 has 2 as its neighbor which leads to a 3-star, forming with nodes 0, 2, and 5. So, we found one 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = [1]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 2, 5)>
