Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up:
Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 5)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>
