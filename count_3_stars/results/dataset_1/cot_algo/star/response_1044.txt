Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 0, 6, 8
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 14, and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 0)>
