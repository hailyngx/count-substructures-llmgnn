Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor of 9
- Node 1: Neighbor of 7
- Node 2: Neighbors of 3, 6
- Node 3: Neighbors of 2, 6
- Node 4: Neighbors of 5, 7
- Node 5: Neighbors of 4, 7
- Node 6: Neighbors of 2, 3
- Node 7: Neighbors of 1, 4, 5
- Node 9: Neighbor of 0

Next, we need to identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars.
- Node 2 and Node 6 have 2 neighbors each. They cannot form 3-stars.
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 7 have 2 neighbors each. They cannot form 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor. It cannot form a 3-star.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars they can form: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each of these nodes.
- Therefore, there are 4 3-stars in total.

Putting this final count inside brackets [], we get: [4]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (2, 6, 3)>
- <4, (5, 7, 4)>
- <5, (4, 7, 5)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
