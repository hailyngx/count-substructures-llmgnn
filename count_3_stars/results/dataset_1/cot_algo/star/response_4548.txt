Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbor {7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbor {9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 7}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1] = [5]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
