Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22, so [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, and <4, (7, 5, 9)>.
