Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 
\[ [1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [28] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
