Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 1, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars formed = 1
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars formed = 1
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars formed = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

So, the final count of 3-stars is [6], and the unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
