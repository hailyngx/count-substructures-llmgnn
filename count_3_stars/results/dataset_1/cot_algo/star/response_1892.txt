Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {3}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and compute the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15 [15]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
