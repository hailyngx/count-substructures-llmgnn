Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 5, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 1, 4
- Node 6: Neighbors are 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 4, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 3, 6, 7

Now, we look at the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 4: <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 6: <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>

Counting up the total unique 3-stars, we have 6 in total:

\[ [6] \]

The unique 3-stars are:

\[ <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)> \]
