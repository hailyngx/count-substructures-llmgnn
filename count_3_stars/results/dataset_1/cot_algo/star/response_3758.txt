Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1 neighbors: 5
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 8
- Node 4 neighbors: 5, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 6, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9 neighbors: 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, and <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <7, (0, 6, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1] = 11.
