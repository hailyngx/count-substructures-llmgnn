Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 8
Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 6
Node 2: 1, 5, 8, 9
Node 3: 1, 7, 9
Node 5: 1, 2, 9
Node 6: 1, 7, 9
Node 7: 3, 6, 8
Node 8: 0, 2, 7
Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 6

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>.
