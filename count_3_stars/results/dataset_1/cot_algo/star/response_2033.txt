Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 2, 7
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 1 = 6].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<2, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<2, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<2, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<7, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
