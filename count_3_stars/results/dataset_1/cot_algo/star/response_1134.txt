Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
