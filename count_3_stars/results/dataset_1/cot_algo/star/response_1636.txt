Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 7, 8: <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, 7: <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 6, 8: <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 4, 9: <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, 6: <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 7, 4: <9, (3, 7, 4)>

As we can see, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
