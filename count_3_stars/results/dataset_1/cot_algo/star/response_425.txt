Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, we will look for nodes that have at least three neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of 9 3-stars in this graph.

Putting the final number inside brackets, we get [9].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 5)>
<7, (8, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
