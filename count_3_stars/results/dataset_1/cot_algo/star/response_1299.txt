Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor set = {6}
- Node 1: Neighbor set = {2, 3}
- Node 2: Neighbor set = {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbor set = {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbor set = {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbor set = {7}
- Node 6: Neighbor set = {0, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor set = {3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbor set = {3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor set = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 3 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 and Node 7 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 10] = [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
