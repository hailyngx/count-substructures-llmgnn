Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 0, 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 6

Next, we will identify which nodes have three or more neighbors and determine the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 3 neighbors - 1 3-star
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors - 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 4 neighbors - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10 \)

So, the answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>
