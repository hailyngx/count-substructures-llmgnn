Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 5

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star
- Node 1: has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors, so 4 3-stars
- Node 4: has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so 4 3-stars
- Node 6: has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star
- Node 7: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, so 4 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9, so the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 9, 4)>
- <3, (2, 9, 5)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
