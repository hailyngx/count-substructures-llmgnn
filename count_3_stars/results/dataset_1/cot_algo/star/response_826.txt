Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 7
Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 1, 5, 8
Node 3: 5, 8
Node 4: 1, 6, 7, 8
Node 5: 2, 3, 6
Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7
Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 6
Node 8: 2, 3, 4
Node 9: 1

Now, we will identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 1 as the center. 
The 3-stars with Node 1 as the center are: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>

Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with Node 2 as the center. 
The 3-star with Node 2 as the center is: <2, (1, 5, 8)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 4 as the center. 
The 3-stars with Node 4 as the center are: <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 6 as the center. 
The 3-stars with Node 6 as the center are: <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 19 \)
So, the total number of 3-stars is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>
