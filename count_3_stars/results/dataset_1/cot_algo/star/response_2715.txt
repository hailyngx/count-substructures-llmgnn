Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the set of neighbors for each node:  

- Node 0: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 7}  
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7}  
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8}  
- Node 5: {0, 8, 9}  
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 8}  
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}  
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}  
- Node 9: {5}  

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:  

- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star  
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars  
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars  
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars  
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars  

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 29  

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (5, 6, 8)>  
<4, (1, 3, 7)>  
<6, (0, 3, 7)>  
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
