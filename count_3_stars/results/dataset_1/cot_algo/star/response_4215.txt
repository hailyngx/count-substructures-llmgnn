Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 9}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {1, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found in this graph is <4, (0, 5, 6)>.
