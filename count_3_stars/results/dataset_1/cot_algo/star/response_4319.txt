Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3
- Node 7: 4
- Node 9: 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 1 + 35 + 4] = 44 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
