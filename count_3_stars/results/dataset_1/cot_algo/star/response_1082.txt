Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, we can determine the 3-stars within it by analyzing the neighbors of each node. 

The list of nodes and their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 9}
- Node 6: {7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 6, 8}

Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 have more than 3 neighbors and thus can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 20 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 3) = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
