Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation formula:
- Node 0: no 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: no 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: no 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: no 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: no 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: no 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
