Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6
- Node 9: 6, 7

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 44.
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>
