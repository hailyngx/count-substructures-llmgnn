Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 7, 8
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 5, 7
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 5, 8
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 4, 6

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8
\(4 \times \binom{3}{3} = 4\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
