Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

1: {3, 7}
2: {3, 5, 8}
3: {1, 2, 6, 7}
4: {7, 9}
5: {2, 6}
6: {3, 5, 9}
7: {1, 3, 4, 9}
8: {2}
9: {4, 6, 7}

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 5, 8)>
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (3, 5, 9)>
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>
Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 11.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<2, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>
