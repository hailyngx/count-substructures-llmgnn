Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2}
- Node 1: {0, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {1, 4}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 7, 8
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 9
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 9)>, and <9, (4, 5)>.
