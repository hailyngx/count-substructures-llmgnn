Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 3, 7

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \(inom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(inom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \(20 + 4 = 24\) which should be written as [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
