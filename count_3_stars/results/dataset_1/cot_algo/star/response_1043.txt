Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 4, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: Neighbors are 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 3, 6
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 8, 9. So, there are 1 3-star. 
- Node 2: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 3: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 4: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 5: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 6: Forms 3-stars with neighbors 1, 5, 7 and 1, 8, 9. Total of 2 3-stars.
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 8, 9. So, there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 9: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.

Putting it all together, we have a total of [4] 3-stars, which are:
- <1, 6, 7, 8>
- <1, 6, 8, 9>
