Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 5)>, <9, (0, 6, 2)>

The total number of 3-stars is 5, so the answer is [5].
