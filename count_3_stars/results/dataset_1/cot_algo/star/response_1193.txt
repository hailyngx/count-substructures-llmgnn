Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 6, 8
- Node 2: forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 7, 9
- Node 8: forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, which we will represent as [4], and these 3-stars are <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>.
