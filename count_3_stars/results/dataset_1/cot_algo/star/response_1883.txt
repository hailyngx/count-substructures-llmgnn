Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 5
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: Neighbor is 0
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 2
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 6, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 2)>
<5, (4, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
