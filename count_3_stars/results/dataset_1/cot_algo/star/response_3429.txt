Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: Can form 1 3-star
- Node 3: Can form 1 3-star
- Node 4: Can form 1 3-star
- Node 7: Can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives 3 (1 + 1 + 1 + 10) =  13.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>. 

So, the final result is [13].
