Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 6, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 2, 4}

Now, let's check for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, so the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 4)>
