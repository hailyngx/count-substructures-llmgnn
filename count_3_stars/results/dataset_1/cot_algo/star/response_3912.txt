Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will list out the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: not enough for a 3-star
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: not enough for a 3-star
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: not enough for a 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32, which we'll represent as [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

So, the final answer is [32], with the unique 3-stars identified.
