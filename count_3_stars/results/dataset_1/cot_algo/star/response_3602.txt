Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 6
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 7, 9: <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, 5: <6, (1, 3, 5)>
  
We have found 2 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [2].
