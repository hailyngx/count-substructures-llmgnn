Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6, 8

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [\binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} +  \binom{4}{3}] = [10 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [28] \]

There are 28 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (8, 9, 5)>, <0, (8, 9, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 9, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 9, 1)>, <6, (5, 9, 7)>, <6, (7, 9, 3)>, <6, (9, 7, 3)>, <6, (9, 8, 0)>, <6, (9, 8, 5)>, <6, (9, 0, 1)>, <6, (9, 0, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 0)>, <6, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (9, 5, 8)>, <6, (9, 5, 0)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (3, 7, 6)>
