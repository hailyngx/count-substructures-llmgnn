Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 7, 8

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1 3-star (exactly 3 neighbors: 6, 9)
- Node 4: 1 3-star (exactly 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 9)
- Node 5: 0 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1 3-star (exactly 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4)
- Node 7: 0 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (exactly 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 9)
- Node 9: 1 3-star (exactly 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 8)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
So, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

Unique 3-stars:
- <3, (6, 9, 4)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 2)>
- <8, (6, 9, 2)>
- <9, (4, 8, 3)>
