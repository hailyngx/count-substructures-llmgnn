Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2}
- Node 6: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {4, 6}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 4] = 14 \).

The unique 3-stars formed are:
1. <0, 1, 3, 4>
2. <0, 1, 3, 5>
3. <0, 1, 3, 8>
4. <0, 1, 4, 5>
5. <0, 1, 4, 8>
6. <0, 1, 5, 8>
7. <0, 3, 4, 5>
8. <0, 3, 4, 8>
9. <0, 4, 5, 8>
10. <1, 2, 5, 7>
11. <1, 2, 5, 8>
12. <3, 4, 9, 6>
13. <0, 1, 3, 4>
14. <0, 1, 3, 5>
