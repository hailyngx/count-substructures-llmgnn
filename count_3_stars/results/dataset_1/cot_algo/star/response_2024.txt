Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9
So, the total number of 3-stars is [9].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>
