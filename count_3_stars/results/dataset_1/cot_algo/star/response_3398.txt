Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 8
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 3

Nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

Therefore, there are 16 3-stars in this graph.
Putting the final number inside brackets: [16]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<5, 4, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
