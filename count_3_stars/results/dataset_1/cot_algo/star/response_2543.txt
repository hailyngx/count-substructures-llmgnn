Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 8
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors (3-stars possible)
- Node 1: 6 neighbors (3-stars possible)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (3-stars possible)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (3-stars possible)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (3-stars possible)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (3-stars possible)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 58 \]

So, there are 58 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
