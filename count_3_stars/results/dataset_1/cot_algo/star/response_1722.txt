Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3-stars: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 3, 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9, 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 9) = 40

Therefore, there are 40 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 9, 0)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>.
