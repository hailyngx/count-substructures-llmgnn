Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 5
Node 1: 2, 6
Node 2: 1, 7
Node 3: 6, 9
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 0, 9
Node 6: 1, 3, 9
Node 7: 2
Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 = 5

So, the final answer is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
