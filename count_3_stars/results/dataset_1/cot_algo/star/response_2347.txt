Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1, 5

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [10 + 1 + 1] = [12]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (8, 9, 6)>
- <1, (8, 9, 7)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
