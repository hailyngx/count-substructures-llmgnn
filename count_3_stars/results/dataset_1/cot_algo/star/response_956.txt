Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 3 can form a 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 can form a 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 6 can form a 3-star: <6, (3, 9, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, and <6, (3, 9, 7)>.
