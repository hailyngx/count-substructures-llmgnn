Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbor {0}
- Node 5: Neighbor {3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbor {7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 6}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 15 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>
