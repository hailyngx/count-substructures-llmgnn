Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7

Next, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1, 4, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7]

Unique 3-stars found: <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>
