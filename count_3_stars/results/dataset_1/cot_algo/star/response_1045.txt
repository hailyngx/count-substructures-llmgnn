Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 6}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {3}

Applying the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 29

Therefore, inside brackets [] we have 29 3-stars. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
