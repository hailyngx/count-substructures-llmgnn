Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18

So, the final result is [18] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
