Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3
- Node 9: 2, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13\), and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>,
<2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>,
<3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>,
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
