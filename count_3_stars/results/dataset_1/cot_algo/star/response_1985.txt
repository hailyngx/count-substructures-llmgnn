Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 2 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form a 3-star.
- Node 1 and Node 4 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form a 3-star.
- Node 6 also has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
There are 3 unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>.

Thus, the final result is: [3].
