Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {2, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 7, 8}

Now, we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 \), so the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (7, 8, 9)>
