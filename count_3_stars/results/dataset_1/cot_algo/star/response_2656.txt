Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 7
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3
Node 6: 3, 7
Node 7: 2, 4, 6
Node 8: 0, 1, 2
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 9 have 5 neighbors each.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed from each of these nodes:

- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- For node 4 with 4 neighbors: It does not have enough neighbors to form any 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 50 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final result is: [50]
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
