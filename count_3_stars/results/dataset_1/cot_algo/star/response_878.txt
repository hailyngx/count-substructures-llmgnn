Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 8, 9
Node 1: 4
Node 3: 4, 7, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 3
Node 5: 6, 7
Node 6: 5, 8
Node 7: 3, 5
Node 8: 0, 6
Node 9: 0, 3

Next, let's identify the 3-stars formed in this graph:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

There are a total of 3 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>.
