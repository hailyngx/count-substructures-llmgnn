Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [45] \]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 8, 9)>
