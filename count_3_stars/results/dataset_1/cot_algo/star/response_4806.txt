Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will first create the adjacency list to determine the neighbors of each node:

0: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9]
1: [0, 6]
2: [0, 3, 8]
3: [0, 2, 5, 6]
4: [7, 9]
5: [3, 8, 9]
6: [0, 1, 3, 8]
7: [4]
8: [2, 5, 6]
9: [0, 4, 5]

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

For node 0, inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 3, inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 5, inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 6, inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing these up gives a total of 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
