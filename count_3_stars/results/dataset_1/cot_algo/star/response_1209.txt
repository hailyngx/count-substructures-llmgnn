Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 1: neighbor {7}
- Node 2: neighbors {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbor {8}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 7, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {5, 8, 9}. <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {2, 6, 9}. <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 8 forms two 3-stars:
  - With neighbors {3, 4, 6}. <8, (3, 4, 6)>
  - With neighbors {2, 4, 7}. <8, (2, 4, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
