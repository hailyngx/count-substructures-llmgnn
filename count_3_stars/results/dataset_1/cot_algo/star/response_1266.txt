Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = 6 \]

Therefore, the final result is [6] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>
