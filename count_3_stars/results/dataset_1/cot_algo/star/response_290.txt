Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes: 5
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes: 2, 4
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes: 1
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes: 7, 8
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes: 0, 7
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes: 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes: 3, 4
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes: 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 7, 8), total number of 3-stars = 1
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes (3, 4, 6), total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <4, (1, 7, 8)> and <7, (3, 4, 6)>.
