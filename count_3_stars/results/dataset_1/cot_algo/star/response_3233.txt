Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: neighbors {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].
