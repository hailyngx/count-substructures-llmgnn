Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Now, we'll look for nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- For Node 0: Does not form any 3-star
- For Node 1: Does not form any 3-star
- For Node 2: Does not form any 3-star
- For Node 6: Forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- For Node 7: Does not form any 3-star

Thus, there is a total of [1] 3-star in the given graph:
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
