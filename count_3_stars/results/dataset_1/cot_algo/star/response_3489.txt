Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 32\)

Therefore, the final answer is [32] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (6, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 9, 7)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (5, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 7, 9)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
