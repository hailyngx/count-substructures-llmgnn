Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 2, 4
- Node 9: 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [0 choose 3] = 0
- Node 1: [0 choose 3] = 0
- Node 2: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 3: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 4: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 6: [0 choose 3] = 0
- Node 7: [0 choose 3] = 0
- Node 8: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 9: [3 choose 3] = 1

Adding them up: 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, and <4, (2, 3, 8)>.
