Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {0, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 5, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each node forms:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the final result is [29] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>
