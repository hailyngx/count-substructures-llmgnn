Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 4, 6

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: (1, 4, 6)
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: (2, 6, 7)
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: (6, 1, 2)
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: (7, 1, 2)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 6), (2, 6, 7), (6, 1, 2), (7, 1, 2)>.
