Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 51, and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 9)>
