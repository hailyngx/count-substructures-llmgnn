Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: 6
Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 1, 4, 7, 8
Node 3: 6
Node 4: 2, 5, 8
Node 5: 4, 6
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 6
Node 8: 2, 4
Node 9: 1, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 29 3-stars.
Therefore, the final answer is [29].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 2)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 2)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<6, (2, 1, 7)>
<6, (2, 1, 9)>
<6, (7, 1, 2)>
<6, (7, 1, 9)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
