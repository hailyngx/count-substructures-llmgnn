Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 8
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: 0, 2, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 8

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 0 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
1 (from Node 0) + 20 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 4) + 4 (from Node 9) = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, (2, 4, 8)>
2. <2, (0, 6, 4)>
3. <2, (0, 7, 4)>
4. <2, (3, 9, 8)>
5. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
6. <9, (2, 3, 4)>
