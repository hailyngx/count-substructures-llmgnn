Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {6}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 9: {1}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <1, (2, 4, 5)> and <5, (1, 3, 6)>.
