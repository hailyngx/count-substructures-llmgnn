Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 3, 5
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 6
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding them up: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, and <9, (2, 4, 6)>.
