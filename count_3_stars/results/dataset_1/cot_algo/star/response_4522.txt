Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's build the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 7}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 8}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <(0, 3, 7), (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 6), (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <(0, 1, 8)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <(7, 8, 2)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars formed: 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars found are <(0, 3, 7), (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 6), (0, 3, 9), (0, 1, 8), (7, 8, 2)>.
