Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1, 6}

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 5, and 8 have 6 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total = \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \)

Therefore, inside brackets [], we have [60].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
