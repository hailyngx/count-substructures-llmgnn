Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 8

Now, we see that nodes 0 and 9 have 4 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars:
- [2] 3-stars

The 3-stars in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
