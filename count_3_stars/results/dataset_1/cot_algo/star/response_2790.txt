Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: [3]
- Node 1: [6, 8, 9]
- Node 2: [5, 6, 7]
- Node 3: [0, 6]
- Node 4: [7, 9]
- Node 5: [2]
- Node 6: [1, 2, 3, 8, 9]
- Node 7: [2, 4]
- Node 8: [1, 6]
- Node 9: [1, 4, 6]

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 10 + 1] = 13

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 9, 8)>, <6, (2, 1, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 9, 8)>, <6, (1, 9, 2)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>
