Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, for nodes that have three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can also form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [58], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
