Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, there is 1 3-star in this graph. 
The unique 3-star is: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
