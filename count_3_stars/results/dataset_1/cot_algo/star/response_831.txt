Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format:
- Node 0 is connected to node 1.
- Node 1 is connected to node 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.

Now, let's calculate the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {2, 4}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {2, 7}

Next, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 2 and Node 9 have 2 neighbors each, so we skip them.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
