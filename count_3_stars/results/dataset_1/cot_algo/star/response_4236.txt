Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \(\binom{n}{3}\), where \(n\) is the number of neighbors.

- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
