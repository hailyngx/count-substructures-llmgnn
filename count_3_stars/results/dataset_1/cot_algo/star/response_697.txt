Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 5, 9} <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 9} <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 4} <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 3} <9, (1, 2, 3)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>.
