Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following structure:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: 
  - (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)
  - (1, 3), (1, 4)
  - (2, 0), (2, 9)
  - (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 9)
  - (4, 1)
  - (5, 0)
  - (6, 0), (6, 3)
  - (7, 0)
  - (8, 0)
  - (9, 2), (9, 3)

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 0:
Neighbors: {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3-stars: 
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>

For Node 1:
Neighbors: {3, 4}
Number of 3-stars: 0

For Node 2:
Neighbors: {0, 9}
Number of 3-stars: 0

For Node 3:
Neighbors: {1, 6, 9}
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3-stars: <3, (1, 6, 9)>

For Node 4:
Neighbors: {1}
Number of 3-stars: 0

For Node 5:
Neighbors: {0}
Number of 3-stars: 0

For Node 6:
Neighbors: {0, 3}
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

For Node 7:
Neighbors: {0}
Number of 3-stars: 0

For Node 8:
Neighbors: {0}
Number of 3-stars: 0

For Node 9:
Neighbors: {2, 3}
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by different nodes, we get a total of 11 3-stars: [11]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>
