Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 7}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:

- Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: Node 5 has less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed
- Node 6: Node 6 has less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed
- Node 7: Node 7 has less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed
- Node 8: Node 8 has less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed
- Node 9: Node 9 has less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([4 + 1 + 1] = [6]\), and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
