Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 1, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [7]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (5, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
