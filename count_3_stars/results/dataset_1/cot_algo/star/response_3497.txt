Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 6}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 4, 7 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>
