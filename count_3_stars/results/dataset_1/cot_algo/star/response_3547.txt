Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors: Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, and Node 9.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 21, which we represent as [21].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 1)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>.
