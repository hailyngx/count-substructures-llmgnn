Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows: 

```
0 -- 4 -- 8 -- 1 -- 9
 \   |   |   |
  \  |   |   |
    6 -- 7
      \
        3
        |
        2
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 9). Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 9). Therefore, it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8). Therefore, it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 9). Therefore, it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 8). Therefore, it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 33

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 9, 1)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (2, 8, 1)>
