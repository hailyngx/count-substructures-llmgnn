Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Next, we will identify the number of 3-stars around each node:
- Node 3 and Node 7 each have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 6 has inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star. <6, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 1] = [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, and <6, (5, 8, 9)>.
