Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 6)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 7)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (nodes 3, 8)
- Node 3: 6 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 6, 9)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (nodes 7, 8)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 5, 6)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 5)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (nodes 4, 6)

Now, we need to find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Summing up the 3-stars from each node: 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
