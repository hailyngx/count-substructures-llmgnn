Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, for nodes with three or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: There are less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: There are less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: There are less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: There are less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: There are less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: There are less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 8) = 25

So, the final answer is [25] with the unique 3-stars being <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, and <8, (2, 3, 4)>
