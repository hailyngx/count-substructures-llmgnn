Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 5, 8
Node 1: 7, 9
Node 2: 3, 6
Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 8
Node 4: 5, 6, 7
Node 5: 0, 3, 4
Node 6: 2, 3, 4
Node 7: 1, 4
Node 8: 0, 3, 9
Node 9: 1, 8

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
