Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 5, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 7, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 3, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 3, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 5
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>.
- Node 3 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>.
- Node 4 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>.
- Node 8 can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>.

Summing up the number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 10] = [27].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (0, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<7, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<7, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<7, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<9, (0, 2, 3)>, 
<9, (0, 3, 4)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<9, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<9, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<9, (3, 5, 6)>.
