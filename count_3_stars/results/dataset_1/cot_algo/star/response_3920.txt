Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [4 + 4] = [8] \]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
