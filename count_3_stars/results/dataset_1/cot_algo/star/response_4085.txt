Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges in terms of the nodes they connect:
- 0 is connected to 2, 4, and 6
- 1 is connected to 5, 6, 8, and 9
- 2 is connected to 0 and 4
- 3 is connected to 5
- 4 is connected to 0, 2
- 5 is connected to 1, 3, 8
- 6 is connected to 0, 1, 7
- 7 is connected to 6 and 8
- 8 is connected to 1, 5, 7
- 9 is connected to 1

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors {2, 4, 6}
- Node 1 has neighbors {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2 has neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 3 has neighbors {5}
- Node 4 has neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 5 has neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 6 has neighbors {0, 1, 7}
- Node 7 has neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 8 has neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 9 has neighbors {1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node:
- Node 0 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- No 3-stars are formed with nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, or 9 as they have less than 3 neighbors
- Node 5 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 8.
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>.
