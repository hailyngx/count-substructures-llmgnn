Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can represent it as follows:
      
```
    1 -- 9
    |      
    0 -- 3 -- 5 -- 6 -- 8
      \  |  |     /    /
       \ |  |    /    /
         4  7 --/
```

Using the given edges, we can find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 7}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 4 + 10] = 18 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 0, 4)>
- <7, (4, 0, 2)>
- <7, (4, 2, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
