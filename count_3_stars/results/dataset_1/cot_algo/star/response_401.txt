Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: Neighbor is 4
- Node 2: Neighbor is 8
- Node 3: Neighbor is 0
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 7
- Node 7: Neighbors are 4, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 2
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 7

Now, let's look at nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. [\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)]
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found is:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
