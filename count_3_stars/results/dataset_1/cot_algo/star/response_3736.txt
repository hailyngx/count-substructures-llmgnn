Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 18 \)

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (8, 7, 9)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
