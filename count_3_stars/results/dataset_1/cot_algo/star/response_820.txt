Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 3

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 2 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 3 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 6 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
