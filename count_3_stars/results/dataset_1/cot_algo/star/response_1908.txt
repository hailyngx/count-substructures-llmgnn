Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 3 3-stars: <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, and <4, (0, 3, 8)>.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1] = 8.
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>
