Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 9
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 1, 3, 7, 9
Node 3: 2, 6
Node 4: 8
Node 5: 6, 7
Node 6: 3, 5, 8
Node 7: 2, 5, 8
Node 8: 4, 6, 7
Node 9: 0, 2

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

\( \text{Node 2: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
\( \text{Node 3: } \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
\( \text{Node 6: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
\( \text{Node 7: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
\( \text{Node 8: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the 3-stars formed in this graph are: <<2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 5, 9)>, <2, (7, 5, 6)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>>.
