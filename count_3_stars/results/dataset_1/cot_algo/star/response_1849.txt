Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 6, 8, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: 2, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1, 3 (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4 (3 neighbors)

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 4, 6, and 9 have 4 neighbors each.

For nodes with 4 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 23 \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
