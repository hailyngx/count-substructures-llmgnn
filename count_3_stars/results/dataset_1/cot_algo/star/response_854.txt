Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to node 3 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to node 1.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars involving node 0 are: <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars involving node 1 are: <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 2)>.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. The 3-stars involving node 6 are: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (7, 5, 8)>.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 8)>.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 27, which can be represented as [27]. The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, and <8, (0, 1, 4)>.
