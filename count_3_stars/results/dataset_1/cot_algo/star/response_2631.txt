Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 2, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 7}

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \[ [10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [21] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
