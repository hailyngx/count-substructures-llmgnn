Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1, Node 6, and Node 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
  - For Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  - For Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  - For Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 9 have exactly 3 neighbors, so each can form 1 3-star.
  - <0, (1, 4, 8)>
  - <3, (4, 6, 8)>
  - <4, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <7, (4, 5, 9)>
  - <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [17]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, and <9, (1, 4, 7)>.
