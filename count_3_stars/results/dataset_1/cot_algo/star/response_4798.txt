Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {4, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 8}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 5}

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 3 and Node 4 have 4 neighbors each.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 8 <1, (3, 0, 4)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 0, 2)>, <1, (4, 0, 3)>, <1, (4, 0, 7)>, <1, (4, 2, 3)>.
