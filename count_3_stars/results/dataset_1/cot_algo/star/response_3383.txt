Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 1}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
