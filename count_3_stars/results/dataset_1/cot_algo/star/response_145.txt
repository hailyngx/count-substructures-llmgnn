Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 9. 

The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 2}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {4}

We can now calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up, we find that there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>
