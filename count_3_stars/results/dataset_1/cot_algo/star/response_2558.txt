Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more visual format. 

The graph has 10 nodes labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4
- Node 9 is connected to node 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors, which is enough to form 10 unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6, 8)>.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10, so the final answer is [10].
