Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 1: 3, 7, 9
Node 2: 4, 7
Node 3: 0, 1, 8
Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 7
Node 5: 8
Node 6: 0, 4, 7, 8
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6
Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 8

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>.
