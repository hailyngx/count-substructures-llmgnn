Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, 6: <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 7, 8: <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, 7: <8, (5, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is 3, so the final answer is [3].
