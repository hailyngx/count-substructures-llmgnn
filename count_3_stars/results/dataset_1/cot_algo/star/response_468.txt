Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 5
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 7, 5, 3
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 8

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars from each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [21] \). 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (7, 8, 5)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 5, 3)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (5, 6, 7)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 8)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (2, 5, 9)>
