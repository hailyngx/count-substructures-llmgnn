Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4] = [5]

Unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <3, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (6, 8, 9)>
