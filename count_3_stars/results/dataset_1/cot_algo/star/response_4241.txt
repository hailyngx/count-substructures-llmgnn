Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 6, 9
Node 1: 8
Node 4: 0, 5
Node 5: 4, 8
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 9
Node 8: 1, 5, 9
Node 9: 0, 7, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, there are a total of 3 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, 4, 5>
<8, 1, 5>
<9, 7, 8>

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [3].
