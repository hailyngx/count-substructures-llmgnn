Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms no 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 forms no 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 3 forms no 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 forms no 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 forms no 3-star as it only has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 forms no 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms no 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, and they are: 
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
