Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5
Node 1: 0, 6, 7
Node 2: 0, 3, 4
Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
Node 4: 2, 5
Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 6: 1
Node 7: 1, 3, 5
Node 9: 3, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 3: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
Node 3 forms two 3-stars:
- With nodes 0, 5, 7: <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- With nodes 2, 5, 9: <3, (2, 5, 9)>

Since the 3-stars are unique, we have a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph.
