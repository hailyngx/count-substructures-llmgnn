Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {0, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [10] \]

Finally, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>
