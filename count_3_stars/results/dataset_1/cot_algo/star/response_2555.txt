Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 2, and 4
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 5, and 6
- Node 2: neighbors are 0 and 5
- Node 3: neighbors are 4, 5, and 7
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 3, and 5
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 7: neighbors are 3, 6, and 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 5 and 6
- Node 9: neighbors are 6 and 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8, which we can represent as [8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
