Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 0
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 2, 7

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, which we will put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 7, 2)>
