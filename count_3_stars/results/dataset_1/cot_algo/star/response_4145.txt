Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 7
Node 1: 3, 5, 8
Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 4: 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
Node 9: 5, 7

Next, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up these counts: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 69

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 69, which we put inside brackets: [69].

Lastly, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
