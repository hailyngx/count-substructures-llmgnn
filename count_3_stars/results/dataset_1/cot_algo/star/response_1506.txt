Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 3, 8
- Node 8: 1, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1

Next, we'll look for nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 7: 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (less than 3, so no 3-star)

Finally, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
Total 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 7) = 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 5, 7> 
<1, 4, 8>
<7, 3, 8>
