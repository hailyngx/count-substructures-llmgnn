Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
Node 0: {2, 6}
Node 1: {5}
Node 2: {0, 6}
Node 3: {8}
Node 4: {8}
Node 5: {1, 6}
Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 7}
Node 7: {6}
Node 8: {3, 4}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 
Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars found: <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>
