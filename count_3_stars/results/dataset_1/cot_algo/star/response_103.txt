Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: neighbor {6}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 4}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<(4, 1, 9), 3>
<(4, 3, 5), 1>
<(4, 5, 7), 9>
<(4, 7, 9), 1>
