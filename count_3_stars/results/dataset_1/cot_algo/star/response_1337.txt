Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 4, 5
Node 1: 8
Node 2: 4, 8, 9
Node 3: 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 7
Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 6: 5
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 1, 2, 5
Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Next, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
These 3-stars are:
<5, 0, 4>, <5, 0, 8>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 4, 9>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
