Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6 (degree 3)
- Node 2: 6, 9 (degree 2)
- Node 3: 5 (degree 1)
- Node 4: 1, 6 (degree 2)
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7 (degree 3)
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 (degree 5)
- Node 7: 5, 6 (degree 2)
- Node 9: 0, 2 (degree 2)

Next, we identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 5, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<5, (0, 3, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 7)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 5, 7)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 2, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 9)>.
