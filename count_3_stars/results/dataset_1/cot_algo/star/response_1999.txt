Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {7, 9}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 7)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 7)>
- Node 4 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 forms 5 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 8 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 7)>, <3, (2, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>
