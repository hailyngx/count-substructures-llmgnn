Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
Node 2: 3, 6
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
Node 4: 0, 1, 3
Node 5: 3, 8
Node 6: 0, 2, 3
Node 7: 9
Node 8: 1, 5, 9
Node 9: 1, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: 6 neighbors -> \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are 35 3-stars in this graph, and they are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (3, 8, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>
