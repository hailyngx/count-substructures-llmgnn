Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 4 <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 8 and 9 <6, (8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
