Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 6}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
