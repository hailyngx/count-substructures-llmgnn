Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually to make it easier to work with:

```
    0 -- 3 -- 6 -- 1 -- 8
    |         |    |    |
    7 -- 2    9 -- 5    |
             |         |
             4         |
                       |
                       5
```

Now, let's calculate the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (3, 6, 7)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (6, 8)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (4, 7)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 4: 1 neighbor (2)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (8, 9)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 7, 9)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 9)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (1, 5)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 7)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (7, 6, 9)>, <3, (9, 6, 7)>.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, but only 2 of them are unique: <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 9, 3)>, <7, (9, 6, 3)>.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 3)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 15, represented as [15]. The unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (7, 6, 9)>, <3, (9, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 9, 3)>, <7, (9, 6, 3)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 3)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>.
