Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {1, 3, 9}: <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 9}: <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {2, 5, 6}: <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 6}: <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 6}: <9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
