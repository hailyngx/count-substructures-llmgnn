Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors are 5 and 9
- Node 1: neighbors are 2, 3, and 6
- Node 2: neighbors are 1 and 5
- Node 3: neighbors are 1 and 5
- Node 4: neighbor is 5
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 2, 3, and 4
- Node 6: neighbors are 1 and 8
- Node 7: neighbor is 8
- Node 8: neighbors are 6 and 7
- Node 9: neighbor is 0

Now, let's look at the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: has 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: has 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, forms 4 3-stars
- Node 6: has 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors (less than 3)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1+4=5]. The unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
