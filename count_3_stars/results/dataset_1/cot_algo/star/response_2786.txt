Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 7}
Node 1: {4, 8, 9}
Node 2: {0, 5}
Node 3: {0, 4}
Node 4: {1, 3, 6}
Node 5: {2, 6, 8}
Node 6: {0, 4, 5}
Node 7: {0, 8, 9}
Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
Node 9: {1, 7}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} \]
\[ = 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
