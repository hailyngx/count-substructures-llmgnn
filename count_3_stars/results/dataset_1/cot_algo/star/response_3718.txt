Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of [14] 3-stars.
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 2, 7)>, <4, (5, 4, 7)>, <4, (5, 4, 8)>, <4, (7, 2, 8)>.
