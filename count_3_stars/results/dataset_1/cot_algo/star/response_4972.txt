Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format for easier visualization:

Node 0: 4, 6, 8
Node 1: 2, 5, 9
Node 2: 1, 8, 9
Node 3: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 9
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 0, 3, 4
Node 7: 3, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's go through each node and its neighbors to count the 3-stars:

Node 0: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed: <0, (4, 6, 8)>
Node 1: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed: <1, (2, 5, 9)>
Node 2: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed: <2, (1, 8, 9)>
Node 3: 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars formed: <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>
Node 4: 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed: <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>
Node 5: 1 neighbor (not enough to form a 3-star)
Node 6: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed: <6, (0, 3, 4)>
Node 7: 2 neighbors (not enough to form a 3-star)
Node 8: 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed: <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>
Node 9: 6 neighbors, so there are 20 3-stars formed: <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20] = [42]

Therefore, the final number of unique 3-stars in this graph is 42.
