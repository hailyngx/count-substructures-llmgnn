Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1,  3, 4 and 5 each have 4 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{8}{3} = 56

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 56 = 80

Therefore, the final answer is [80] and the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
