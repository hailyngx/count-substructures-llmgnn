Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
These 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
These 3-stars are <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
These 3-stars are <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
This 3-star is <3, (1, 2, 9)>.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
These 3-stars are <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
These 3-stars are <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
These 3-stars are <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
This 3-star is <9, (2, 3, 4)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 48, so the final answer is [48]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>.
