Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [24]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (5, 1, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
