Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: [1 3-star]
- Node 1: [1 3-star]
- Node 4: [1 3-star]
- Node 8: [1 3-star]
- Node 9: [1 3-star]

Total number of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 9, 4>
<4, 8, 9>
