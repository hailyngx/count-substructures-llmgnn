Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 4
- Node 2: Neighbor is 1
- Node 3: Neighbors are 7, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 8
- Node 5: Neighbor is 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 7, 8
- Node 7: Neighbors are 3, 6
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: Neighbor is 3

Next, we check the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{8}{3} = 56 \]

So, there are a total of 56 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
