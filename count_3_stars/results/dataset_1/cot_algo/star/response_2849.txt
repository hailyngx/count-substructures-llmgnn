Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 8}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {0, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. These are:
  <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, there is a total of [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
