Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 1: 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 5, 8
Node 3: 1, 5, 6
Node 4: 5, 9
Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6
Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 7
Node 7: 1, 6, 9
Node 8: 2, 9
Node 9: 1, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 1: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors 3, 6, 7
Node 3: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, 6
Node 5: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors 2, 4, 6
Node 6: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, 5
Node 7: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors 1, 6, 9
Node 9: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, 8

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, and <9, (1, 7, 8)>.
