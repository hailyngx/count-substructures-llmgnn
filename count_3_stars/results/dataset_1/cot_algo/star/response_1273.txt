Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 3 forms 16 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (3, 7, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 2)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 3, 6)>, <3, (9, 1, 2)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 16 + 1 + 1] = 20.
