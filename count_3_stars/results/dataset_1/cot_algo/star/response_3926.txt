Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph would be the sum of these, which is 20 + 4 + 4 = 28. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>.
