Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4}, degree 2
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 9}, degree 4
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 8}, degree 2
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 7}, degree 2
- Node 5: Neighbors {6}, degree 1
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}, degree 3
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}, degree 3
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6}, degree 2
- Node 9: Neighbors {1}, degree 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star (1, 6, 7)
- Node 2: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 0 3-stars
- Node 5: 0 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star (6, 1, 8)
- Node 7: 1 3-star (7, 1, 2)
- Node 8: 0 3-stars
- Node 9: 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, 6, 7>
- <6, 1, 8>
- <7, 1, 2>
