Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can represent it as a list of edges:

(0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9),
(1, 4), (1, 7),
(2, 8), (2, 9),
(3, 0), (3, 7),
(4, 1), (4, 9),
(5, 6), (5, 8),
(6, 5), (6, 9),
(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 8),
(8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 7),
(9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6).

Let's now find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: Neighbors {3, 7, 8, 9} => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<Node 0, (3, 7, 8)>, <Node 0, (3, 7, 9)>, <Node 0, (3, 8, 9)>, <Node 0, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7} => No 3-star

Node 2: Neighbors {8, 9} => No 3-star

Node 3: Neighbors {0, 7} => No 3-star

Node 4: Neighbors {1, 9} => No 3-star

Node 5: Neighbors {6, 8} => No 3-star

Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9} => No 3-star

Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 8} => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<Node 7, (0, 1, 3)>, <Node 7, (0, 1, 8)>, <Node 7, (0, 3, 8)>, <Node 7, (1, 3, 8)>

Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7} => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<Node 8, (0, 2, 5)>, <Node 8, (0, 2, 7)>, <Node 8, (0, 5, 7)>, <Node 8, (2, 5, 7)>

Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6} => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<Node 9, (0, 2, 4)>, <Node 9, (0, 2, 6)>, <Node 9, (0, 4, 6)>, <Node 9, (2, 4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16]

Unique 3-stars: 
<Node 0, (3, 7, 8)>, <Node 0, (3, 7, 9)>, <Node 0, (3, 8, 9)>, <Node 0, (7, 8, 9)>,
<Node 7, (0, 1, 3)>, <Node 7, (0, 1, 8)>, <Node 7, (0, 3, 8)>, <Node 7, (1, 3, 8)>,
<Node 8, (0, 2, 5)>, <Node 8, (0, 2, 7)>, <Node 8, (0, 5, 7)>, <Node 8, (2, 5, 7)>,
<Node 9, (0, 2, 4)>, <Node 9, (0, 2, 6)>, <Node 9, (0, 4, 6)>, <Node 9, (2, 4, 6)>
