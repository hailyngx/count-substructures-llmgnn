Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph:

```
  1 -- 2
 /  \ | \
0 -  3-  8
 \  /   /
  4 --- 5
     \
      6
       \
        7
```

Now, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4: Only 1 3-star (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 47

So, the final result is [47] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (2, 3, 9)>, <3, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 1)>
