Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star

Adding them up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
