Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars -> {<4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>}
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Counting up the total number of 3-stars: [8]
Unique 3-stars: {<4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>}
