Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
