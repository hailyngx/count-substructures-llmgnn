Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {1}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 6: neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {4}
- Node 8: neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1, 6, 8}

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: forms 3-stars with {(0, 1, 3), (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 5)}, total 3
- Node 4: forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: forms 3-stars with {(0, 1, 9), (1, 6, 9), (6, 8, 9)}, total 3

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 11
So, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars are <(0, 1, 3), (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 5), (0, 1, 9), (1, 6, 9), (6, 8, 9)>.
