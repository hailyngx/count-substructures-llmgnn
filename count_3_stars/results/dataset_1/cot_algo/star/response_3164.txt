Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Now we'll check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 2 each have 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9, written as [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
