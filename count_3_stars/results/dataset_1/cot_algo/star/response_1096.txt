Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 8

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4

Therefore, the final answer is [4] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
