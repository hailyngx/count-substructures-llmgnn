Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbor set for each node. Then we will check if any node has three or more neighbors to form a 3-star.

The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 8}

Nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8 each have three or more neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
  - <2, (3, 5, 8)>
  - <2, (5, 6, 8)>
  - <2, (3, 6, 8)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 7, 5)>
  - <4, (7, 9, 5)>
  - <4, (3, 9, 5)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (2, 3, 7)>
  - <5, (2, 3, 8)>
  - <5, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (2, 7, 8)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <8, (2, 5, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 13. 

The unique 3-stars found are <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 5)>, <4, (7, 9, 5)>, <4, (3, 9, 5)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>.
