Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 2 forms 6 different 3-stars: <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (8, 7, 9)>
2. Node 8 forms 3 different 3-stars: <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
3. Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (2, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<2, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (8, 7, 9)>, 
<8, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<8, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<8, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 7, 3)>
