Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we'll identify the 3-stars. From the neighbor sets:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 have 5 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up these numbers: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 48 \)

Therefore, there are 48 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)> 

So, the final answer is [48].
