Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {3}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: neighbors {7}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- No other node has 3 or more neighbors to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>
