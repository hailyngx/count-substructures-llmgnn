Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0, 6, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors which can potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (potential)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (potential)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (potential)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (potential)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10. Thus, the final result is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <7, (6, 4, 8)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 8)>
- <8, (4, 7, 8)>
