Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 8}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6, 7}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 23 3-stars.

Therefore, the final result is [23] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>
