Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {0, 2}
- Node 7: {2, 3}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6} (Has 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 9} (Has 4 neighbors)
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 8} (Has 4 neighbors)
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8, 9} (Has 4 neighbors)

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: [\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)]
- Node 2: [\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)]
- Node 3: [\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)]
- Node 4: [\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
