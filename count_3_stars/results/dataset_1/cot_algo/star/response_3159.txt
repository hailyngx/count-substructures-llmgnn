Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3

Next, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars it can form:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up: 4 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
