Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 9: 3, 4, 6

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
