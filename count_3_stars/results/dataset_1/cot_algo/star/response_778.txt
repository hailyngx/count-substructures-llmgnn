Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 5, and 9 each have 4 neighbors.
- Node 0 and 8 each have 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Finally, we compute the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \]

Therefore, the final result is [12] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
