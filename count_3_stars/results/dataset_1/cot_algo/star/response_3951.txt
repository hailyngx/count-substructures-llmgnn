Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2}
Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 7}
Node 2: {0, 6}
Node 3: {1, 6, 8, 9}
Node 4: {6}
Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 9}
Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Node 7: {1, 5, 8}
Node 8: {3, 7, 9}
Node 9: {3, 5, 8}

Now, we will identify 3-star structures:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 6)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 8, 9)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 7)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 3)> <6, (1, 4, 5)> 

Since only nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, which is represented as [4].
