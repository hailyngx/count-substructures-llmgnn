Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 7 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 9 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 16]

Unique 3-stars found: <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (7, 6, 9)>, <4, (9, 5, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>
