Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 1, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 13. 

Therefore, the result is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>.
