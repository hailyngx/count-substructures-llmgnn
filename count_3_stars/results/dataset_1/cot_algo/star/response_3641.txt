Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {7}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 2: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars are:

<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 9, 8)>
