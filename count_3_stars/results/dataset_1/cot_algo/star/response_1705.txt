Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 5: 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6

Next, we will check nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to see if they form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Counting the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 28

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28]. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, and <9, (5, 6, 9)>.
