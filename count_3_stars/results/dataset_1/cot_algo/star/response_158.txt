Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 7}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {1, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (Exactly 1 3-star with node 5 as center)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [19] \)

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 2, 4)>
