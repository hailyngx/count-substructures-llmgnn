Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7 have 6 neighbors each.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 3: \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 4: \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 7: \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \)

There is 1 3-star for Node 1 and 1 3-star for Node 9.

Adding them up, we have a total of 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 82 3-stars. So, the final result is [82].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <7, (0, 7, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- (1, 3, 6)
- (4, 7, 9)
