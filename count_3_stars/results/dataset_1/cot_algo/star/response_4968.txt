Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the provided edges:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 27, so we have a total of 27 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)> 

Therefore, the final result is:
[] = 27
