Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: neighbor nodes are 6.
- Node 2: neighbor nodes are 3, 5.
- Node 3: neighbor nodes are 2, 7.
- Node 4: neighbor nodes are 7, 8, 9.
- Node 5: neighbor nodes are 2.
- Node 6: neighbor nodes are 1.
- Node 7: neighbor nodes are 3, 4, 9.
- Node 8: neighbor nodes are 4.
- Node 9: neighbor nodes are 4, 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2, 3-stars: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 4, 3-stars: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7, 3-stars: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [2]
Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
