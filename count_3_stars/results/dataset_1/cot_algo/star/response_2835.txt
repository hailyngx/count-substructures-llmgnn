Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4+4] = 8.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>
