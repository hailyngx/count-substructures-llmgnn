Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 6
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 2, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 6

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 1
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for Node 2
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 6
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 7
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 9

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
