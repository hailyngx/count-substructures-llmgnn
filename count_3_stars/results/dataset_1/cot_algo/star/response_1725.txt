Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 9: <2, (4, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7: <3, (4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3: <4, (2, 3)>
- Node 8 forms 3 3-stars:
  - <8, (0, 3, 4)>
  - <8, (3, 7, 4)>
  - <8, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
