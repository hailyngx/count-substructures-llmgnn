Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- No other node has at least 3 neighbors, so we only need to consider the 3-stars involving node 3.

Therefore, we have a total of [4] 3-stars, which are:
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (8, 9, 7)>
