Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 6}: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 6, 7}: <2, (4, 6, 7)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 4}: <7, (2, 3, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
