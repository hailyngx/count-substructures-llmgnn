Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 2.

Next, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 8}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {2}

Now, let's check each node to see if it can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: can form 1 3-star with neighbors {5, 8} => Total 3-stars: 1
- Node 1: can form 1 3-star with neighbors {3, 5, 7} => Total 3-stars: 1
- Node 2: can form 1 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 9} => Total 3-stars: 1
- Node 3: cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 4: cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 5: can form 1 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 2} => Total 3-stars: 1
- Node 6: cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 7: cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 8: can form 1 3-star with neighbors {0, 5, 6} and 1 3-star with neighbors {3, 5, 6} => Total 3-stars: 2
- Node 9: cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors

Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
