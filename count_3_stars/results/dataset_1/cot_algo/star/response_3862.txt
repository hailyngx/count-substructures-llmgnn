Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 8: 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, we see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 7 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 5, 7)> 
- Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 7)> 
- Node 2: <2, (0, 5, 7)> 
- Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars = [5]
