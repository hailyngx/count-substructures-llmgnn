Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up: [4 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [16]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (8, 9, 1)>, <0, (8, 9, 4)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 0, 9)>, <8, (2, 0, 9)>, <8, (3, 0, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (4, 0, 8)>
