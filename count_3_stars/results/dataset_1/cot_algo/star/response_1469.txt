Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 6, 9
Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 7
Node 2: 1, 4, 7, 9
Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6
Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7
Node 5: 1, 3, 9
Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 7
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 7
Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 7

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
For nodes with 4 neighbors, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars per node, so a total of \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) 3-stars.
For node 7 with 6 neighbors, we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [24 + 20] = 44 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
