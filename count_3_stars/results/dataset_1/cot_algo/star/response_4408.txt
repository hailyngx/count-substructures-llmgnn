Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 = 18, which gives us the final number inside brackets: [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the given graph.
