Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, forming [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars: <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (8, 9, 1)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <1, (0, 8, 5)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 9, 3)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [21].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, 
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<0, (4, 8, 9)>, 
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<0, (8, 9, 1)>, 
<1, (0, 8, 5)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 9)>, 
<5, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<5, (1, 9, 3)>, 
<5, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<6, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<8, (0, 2, 3)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 3)>.
