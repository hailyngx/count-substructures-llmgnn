Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 8: 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 8

Next, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [7] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <9, 0, 5>
- <9, 0, 8>
- <9, 4, 8>
- <9, 5, 8>
