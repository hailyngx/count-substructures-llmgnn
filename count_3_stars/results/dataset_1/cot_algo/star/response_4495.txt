Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Yes (3 neighbors)
- Node 1: Yes (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: Yes (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: Yes (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: Yes (5 neighbors)

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 17.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
