Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars: <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 20 = 28, which can be written as [28].
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>
