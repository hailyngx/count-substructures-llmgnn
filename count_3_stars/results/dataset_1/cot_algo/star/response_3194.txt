Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 4}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Nodes 2 and 3 each have 5 neighbors, so they can each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 0, 4, and 6 each have 3 neighbors but cannot form a 3-star as they need at least 3 edges to different nodes.
- Nodes 1, 7, and 8 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form a 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 10 + 4] = [24] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (2, 6, 8)>
- <6, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (4, 6, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- <7, (3, 4, 8)>
