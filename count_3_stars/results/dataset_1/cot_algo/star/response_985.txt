Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's build the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 8}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 8}

Next, we'll apply the combinatorial calculation to each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 can form a 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <9, (1, 4, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, and <9, (1, 4, 8)>.
