Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can create the following neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {3, 6, 7}
Node 1: {5, 7, 9}
Node 3: {0, 6, 7}
Node 4: {5, 8, 9}
Node 5: {1, 4, 9}
Node 6: {0, 3, 8}
Node 7: {0, 1, 3}
Node 8: {4, 6}
Node 9: {1, 4, 5}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 2 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars we found, we get a total of [8].

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
