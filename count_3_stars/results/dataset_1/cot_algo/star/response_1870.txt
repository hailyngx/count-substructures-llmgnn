Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 6

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 and Node 7 have 5 neighbors each.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 = 20.

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 7, 8)>
