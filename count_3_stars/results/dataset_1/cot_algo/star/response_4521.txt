Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4] = [12] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 2, 6, 7>
- <0, 2, 6, 9>
- <0, 6, 1, 7>
- <0, 6, 3, 5>
- <2, 0, 8, 4>
- <2, 0, 8, 7>
- <2, 8, 4, 9>
- <6, 0, 1, 7>
- <6, 0, 3, 5>
- <6, 1, 7, 8>
- <6, 3, 5, 0>
- <8, 2, 4, 9>
