Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {2, 5, 6}
Node 1: {2, 4, 6}
Node 2: {0, 1, 3}
Node 3: {2, 4}
Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8}
Node 5: {0, 6}
Node 6: {0, 1, 5, 9}
Node 7: {4}
Node 8: {4, 9}
Node 9: {6, 8}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0] = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 9, 9)>.
