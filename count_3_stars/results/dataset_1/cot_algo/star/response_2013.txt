Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
For this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 2, 8
Node 1 neighbors: 5, 7
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 6, 8
Node 3 neighbors: 7, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 5, 6
Node 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 8
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 4
Node 7 neighbors: 1, 3, 5
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 3, 8

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 8, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 7, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 8, 6)> and <5, (1, 7, 8)>.
