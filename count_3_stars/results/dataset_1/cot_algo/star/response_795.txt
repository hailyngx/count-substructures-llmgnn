Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 7, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 4] = [76] \]

Therefore, we have found a total of 76 unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>

Similarly, there would be 6 such 3-stars (but are not unique).
