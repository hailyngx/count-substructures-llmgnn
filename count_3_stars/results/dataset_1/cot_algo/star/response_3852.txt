Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9 and the edges are given as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to node 9
- Node 2 is connected to node 8
- Node 3 is connected to node 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 3
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to node 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, and 9. So it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
These 3-stars are: <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>.

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 8, and 9. So it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
These 3-stars are: <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>.

Thus, there are a total of [4 + 4] = 8 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>.
