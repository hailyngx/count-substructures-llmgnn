Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph, and they are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
