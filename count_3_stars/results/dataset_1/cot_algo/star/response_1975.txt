Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes - 4
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes - 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes - 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes - 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes - 0
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes - 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes - 1, 9
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes - 5
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes - 1, 2
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes - 1, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars using the given information:
- For Node 1, we have 5 neighbors, so we can form (inom{5}{3}) = 10 3-stars. 
  The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, and <1, (6, 8, 9)>.
  
Total number of 3-stars formed: [10]
