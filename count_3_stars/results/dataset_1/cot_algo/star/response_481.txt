Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 4, 6) <0, (4, 6)>
- Node 5: 1 3-star (5, 7, 8) <5, (7, 8)>
- Node 8: 1 3-star (8, 4, 5) <8, (4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
