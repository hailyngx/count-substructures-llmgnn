Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 7 and 8.
- Node 1: Neighbor is 6.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 3: Neighbor is 2.
- Node 4: Neighbor is 5.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 2, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 6, 7.
- Node 9: Neighbor is 7.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, which we will represent inside brackets as [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>.
