Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1, 8, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 cannot form a 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 cannot form a 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with neighbors 2, 8, and 9. <8, (2, 9, 8)>
- Node 9 can form a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, and 8. <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <8, (2, 9, 8)> and <9, (1, 2, 8)>.
