Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: (2, 3, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 1: (4, 8, 9)
- Node 2: (0, 3, 4)
- Node 3: (0, 2, 9)
- Node 4: (1, 2, 7)
- Node 5: (8, 9)
- Node 6: (7, 8)
- Node 7: (0, 4, 6, 8)
- Node 8: (0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 9: (0, 1, 3, 5, 8)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph. We'll focus on nodes with 3 or more neighbors.
By calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 47 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [47] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 8, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
