Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's figure out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes are 5. (1 neighbor)
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes are 7, 8. (2 neighbors)
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes are 5, 9. (2 neighbors)
- Node 4: Neighbor node is 5. (1 neighbor)
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes are 0, 3, 4. (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes are 2, 9. (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes are 2, 9. (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes are 3, 7, 8. (3 neighbors)

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, 4: <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, 8: <9, (3, 7, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
