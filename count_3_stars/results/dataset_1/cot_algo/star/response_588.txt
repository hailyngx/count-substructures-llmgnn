Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 2
- Node 1: neighbors are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 4, 9
- Node 3: neighbors are 1, 7, 8
- Node 4: neighbors are 1, 2
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 6
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 5
- Node 7: neighbors are 1, 3, 8
- Node 8: neighbors are 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: neighbors are 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13, which we will represent as [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
