Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is \([1 + 1 + 4] = 6\).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
