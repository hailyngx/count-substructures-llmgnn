Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {6, 7}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 10 + 1] = 15 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 5)>
<1, (8, 9, 5)>
<1, (4, 9, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 1)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 1)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 1, 9)>
<5, (7, 1, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 5)>
<7, (6, 9, 5)>
