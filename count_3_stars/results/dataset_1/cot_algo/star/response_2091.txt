Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we'll find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, we can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 4, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, and <7, (5, 6, 9)>.
