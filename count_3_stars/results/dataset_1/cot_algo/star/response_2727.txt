Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: (1, 3, 4, 6, 7)
- Node 1: (0, 2, 4, 8)
- Node 2: (1, 4, 7)
- Node 3: (0, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 5: (3, 8, 9)
- Node 6: (0, 4, 8)
- Node 7: (0, 2, 3)
- Node 8: (1, 4, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 9: (3, 4, 5, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 48.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>.
