Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: neighbors {6}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 9: neighbor {4}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:

- Node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars each node can form:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph. The total number of 3-stars is 0, which we represent as [0].
