Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we need to first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 \)

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 0)>

So, the final answer is [22].
