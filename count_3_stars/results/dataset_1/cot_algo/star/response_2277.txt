Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:

Node 0: 4, 5, 8  
Node 2: 3, 5, 9  
Node 3: 2, 5  
Node 4: 0, 7, 8, 9  
Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 9  
Node 7: 4  
Node 8: 0, 4, 9  
Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 8  

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 8)>  
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 5, 9)>  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:  
<4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>  
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:  
<5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>  
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 4, 9)>  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:  
<9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 15, which can be written as [15].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>
