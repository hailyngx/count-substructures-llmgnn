Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2 and 5
- Node 1: Neighbor is 2
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 3: Neighbor is 2
- Node 4: Neighbor is 5
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 4, and 8
- Node 6: Neighbor is 2
- Node 7: Neighbor is 2
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2 and 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total 3-stars formed: 20 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [21].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
