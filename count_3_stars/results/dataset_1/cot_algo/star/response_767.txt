Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 7}

Next, we will check for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find any possible 3-stars:
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 9 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <7, (3, 8, 4)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- <7, (8, 4, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>
