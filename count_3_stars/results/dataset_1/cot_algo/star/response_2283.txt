Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 0, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 = 20.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 4)>
<6, (2, 8, 4)>
<6, (3, 8, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
