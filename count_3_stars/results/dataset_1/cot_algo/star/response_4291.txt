Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {7, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {6, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 4}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 6, 8} <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 6} <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 6 also forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 3, 5} <6, (1, 3, 5)>, in addition to the 3-star with Node 4 that was already counted
- Nodes 0, 3, 7, and 9 do not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, and <6, (1, 3, 5)>.
