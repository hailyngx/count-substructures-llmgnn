Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 6, 7, 8
- Node 1 neighbors: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 3, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4 neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 4
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 9 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [22], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.
