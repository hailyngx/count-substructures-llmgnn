Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 5, 8
- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2 neighbors: 1, 7, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6 neighbors: 1
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 9 neighbors: 2, 3

Nodes 1 and 8 have more than 3 neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [20 + 4] = 24 \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (8, 9, 3)>
