Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 9

Calculating \( \text{inom}{n}{3} \) for the above nodes:
- Node 0: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
