Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5
- Node 7: 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 1, 5, 7

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these up: 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>.
