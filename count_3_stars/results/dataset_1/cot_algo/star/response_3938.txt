Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {0, 8}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 5, 7, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (8, 9, 9)>
