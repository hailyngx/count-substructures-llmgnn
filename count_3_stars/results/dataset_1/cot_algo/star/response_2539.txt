Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <1, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <1, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <1, (2, 4, 7)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <2, (1, 7, 8)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <3, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <3, (0, 8, 9)>
  - <3, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (2, 3, 4)>
  - <8, (2, 4, 9)>
  - <8, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <8, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [13] \). The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>.
