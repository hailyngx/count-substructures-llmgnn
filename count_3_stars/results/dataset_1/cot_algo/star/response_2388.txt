Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1, 6, 9
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 7

Next, let's identify 3-stars in this graph based on the neighbors:
- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. 
- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are: <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 2)>, <1, (7, 9, 4)>.
- Node 4: It has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 9: It has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are: <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (7, 4, 5)>.

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10. So, the final answer is [10].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 2)>, <1, (7, 9, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (7, 4, 5)>.
