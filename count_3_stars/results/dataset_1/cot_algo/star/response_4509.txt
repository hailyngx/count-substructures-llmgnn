Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph consists of the following nodes and their neighbors:

Node 0: {4, 8}
Node 1: {5, 6, 9}
Node 2: {4}
Node 4: {0, 2, 6}
Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 9}
Node 6: {1, 4, 5}
Node 7: {5, 9}
Node 8: {0}
Node 9: {1, 5, 7}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 9)>
Total number of 3-stars: [1]
