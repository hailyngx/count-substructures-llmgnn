Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6
- Node 9: 6

Now, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total:
10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 3)>, <0, (2, 4, 1)>, <0, (2, 8, 5)>, <0, (2, 8, 6)>, <0, (4, 8, 6)>, <0, (4, 7, 0)>, <0, (4, 3, 5)>, <0, (4, 3, 1)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 7, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 0)>, <2, (1, 4, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 1)>, <4, (1, 2, 0)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 0)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>
