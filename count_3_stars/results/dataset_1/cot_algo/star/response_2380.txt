Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph described with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: Since it has 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star with node 0: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 3: Since it has 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star with node 3: <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 6: Since it has 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star with node 6: <6, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, and <6, (2, 3, 9)>.
