Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5
- Node 9: 5, 7

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 4: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 4: <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 3: <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, 9: <5, (3, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 3 (since duplicates are removed), so the final answer is [3].
