Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 6, 8
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 8

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 6, 8, and 9. 

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
