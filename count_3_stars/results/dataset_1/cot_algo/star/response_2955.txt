Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

Now, we'll identify the 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4] = 5, and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>.
