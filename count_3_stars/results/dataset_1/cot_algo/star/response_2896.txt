Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 3 and 7
- Node 1: neighbors are 2, 3, 4, and 7
- Node 2: neighbors are 1 and 6
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6
- Node 4: neighbors are 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 3 and 8
- Node 6: neighbors are 2, 3, and 4
- Node 7: neighbors are 0 and 1
- Node 8: neighbors are 4 and 5
- Node 9: neighbor is 4

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 = 24

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, and <4, (1, 3, 8)>.
