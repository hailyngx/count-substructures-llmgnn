Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 1: 3, 4
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 1, 9
Node 4: 1, 2, 8
Node 6: 9
Node 7: 8
Node 8: 4, 7
Node 9: 3, 6

Next, we will find the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1  (1 unique 3-star <4, (1, 2, 8)>)
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [1] and the unique 3-star found is <4, (1, 2, 8)>.
