Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 3, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 1, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 7

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 4 + 10] = [24] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>
