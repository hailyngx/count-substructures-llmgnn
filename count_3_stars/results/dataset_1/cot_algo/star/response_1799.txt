Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
