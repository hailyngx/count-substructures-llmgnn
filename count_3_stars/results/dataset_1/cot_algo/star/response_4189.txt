Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 6, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>
