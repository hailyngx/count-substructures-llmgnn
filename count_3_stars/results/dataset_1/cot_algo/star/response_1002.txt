Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we can start by finding the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (7, 9, 0)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <8, (5, 9, 0)>, <8, (5, 9, 1)>, <8, (5, 0, 1)>, <8, (9, 0, 1)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 8, 3)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 0)>, <9, (5, 3, 4)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, <9, (5, 4, 0)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10] = [27].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (7, 9, 0)>
- <8, (5, 9, 0)>
- <8, (5, 9, 1)>
- <8, (5, 0, 1)>
- <8, (9, 0, 1)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 3)>
- <9, (5, 6, 4)>
- <9, (5, 6, 0)>
- <9, (5, 8, 3)>
- <9, (5, 8, 4)>
- <9, (5, 8, 0)>
- <9, (5, 3, 4)>
- <9, (5, 3, 0)>
- <9, (5, 4, 0)>
