Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1}
- Node 9: {0, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, and <0, (3, 8, 9)>.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, and <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, and <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars found, we have a total of [19]. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, and <5, (3, 4, 7)>.
