Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5
- Node 9: 6

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: inom{1}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these up: \( 1 + 10 + 1 = 12 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (2, 5, 0)>
