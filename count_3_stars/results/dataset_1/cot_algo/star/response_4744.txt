Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list for better visualization:

Node 0: [1, 3, 5]
Node 1: [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
Node 2: [1, 6, 8]
Node 3: [0, 5, 9]
Node 4: [1, 9]
Node 5: [0, 1, 3] 
Node 6: [1, 2, 8, 9]
Node 7: [9]
Node 8: [1, 2, 6]
Node 9: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph based on the neighbor sets and the number of neighbors for each node:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 2.

Therefore, the final answer is [2], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
