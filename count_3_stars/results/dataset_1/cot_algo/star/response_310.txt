Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph information, we can determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 9 \).

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>.
