Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {5}
Node 1: {4, 5, 9}
Node 2: {3}
Node 3: {2, 4, 5}
Node 4: {1, 3, 6}
Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 8}
Node 6: {4, 8, 9}
Node 7: {9}
Node 8: {5, 6}
Node 9: {1, 6, 7}

Now we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 9)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 5)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 6)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 3)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (4, 8, 9)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 6 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
