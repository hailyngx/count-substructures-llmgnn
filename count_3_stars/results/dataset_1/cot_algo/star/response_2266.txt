Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 0, 6, 9
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Since it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1: Since it has 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2: Since it has 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3: It can form a 3-star with neighbors (6, 9).
- Node 4: Since it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5: It can form a 3-star with neighbors (0, 2, 4) and another with neighbors (6, 7, 8).
- Node 6: It can form a 3-star with neighbors (3, 5, 9).
- Node 7: Since it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8: Since it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9: It can form a 3-star with neighbors (3, 4, 6).

Therefore, the 3-stars are:
- <3, (6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Since we have found 4 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
