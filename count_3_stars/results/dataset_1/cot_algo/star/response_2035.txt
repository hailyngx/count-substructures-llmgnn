Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 9}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves {3, 9}.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves {2, 9}.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves {5, 7, 9}.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 3, and they are represented as follows:
[3]
<2, (3, 9)>, <3, (2, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>
