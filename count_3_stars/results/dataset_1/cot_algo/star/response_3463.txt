Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {5, 9}
Node 1: {4, 9}
Node 2: {5, 9}
Node 3: {6, 8}
Node 4: {1, 7, 9}
Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
Node 6: {3, 5, 7}
Node 7: {4, 6}
Node 8: {3, 5, 9}
Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with nodes having 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3-star configurations:
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 32

Therefore, the final count is [32] and the unique 3-stars are:
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 9)>

<9, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 9)>
