Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2}
- Node 7: {2, 3}
- Node 8: {0, 5}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
