Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-star graph in the given network, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 9}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 5}
Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
Node 3: Neighbors {2, 7, 8, 9}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
Node 5: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7}
Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5} -> Total 3-stars = 1
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 9, 7} -> Total 3-stars = 2

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 5)>
<3, (8, 9, 7)>
