Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0, 3, 9
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed at each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph, which are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>
