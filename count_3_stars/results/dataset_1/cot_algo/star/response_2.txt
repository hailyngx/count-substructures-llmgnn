Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 6)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 5, 6)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 6)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 5, 5)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 7, 8)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 8)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (nodes 7, 8)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
4. Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
5. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, and <8, (4, 5, 7)>.
