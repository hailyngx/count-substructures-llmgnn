Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5, 6, 9
Node 1: 4, 7
Node 2: 8, 9
Node 3: 5, 7, 9
Node 4: 1
Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 8
Node 7: 1, 3, 5
Node 8: 2, 5, 6
Node 9: 0, 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( C(3,3) = 1 3\text{-star} \)
Node 3: \( C(3,3) = 1 3\text{-star} \)
Node 5: \( C(4,3) = 4 3\text{-stars} \)
Node 8: \( C(3,3) = 1 3\text{-star} \)
Node 9: \( C(3,3) = 1 3\text{-star} \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [8] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>.
