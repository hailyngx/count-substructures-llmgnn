Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6
Node 1: 0, 3, 8, 9
Node 2: 5, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 2, 9
Node 6: 0, 3
Node 7: 3, 4, 8
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:

Node 0: Forms 3-stars
Node 1: Forms 3-stars
Node 3: Forms 3-stars
Node 4: Forms 3-stars
Node 8: Forms 3-stars
Node 9: Forms 3-stars

Calculating the total number of unique 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 4 + 10 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 14. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
