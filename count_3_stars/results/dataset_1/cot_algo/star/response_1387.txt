Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars:
Total Number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 26

So, in this graph, there are 26 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [26].
