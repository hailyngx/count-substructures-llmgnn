Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

So, the total number of 3-stars [] = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 16

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 6, 8)>
