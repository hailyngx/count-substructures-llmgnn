Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars. Nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 28 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
