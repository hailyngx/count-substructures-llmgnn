Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, which we put inside brackets: [6].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>

So, the final answer is:
[6]
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>
