Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 4, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 2, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {6}
- Node 6: neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 can form 1 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star: <7, (2, 4, 6)>

Summing up, we have a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
