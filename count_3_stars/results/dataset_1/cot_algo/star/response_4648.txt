Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we'll determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (less than 3)

Summing up, we have a total of 3 3-stars, which are: <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, and <7, (1, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
