Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8 have 5 neighbors each.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Total number of 3-stars: 4*10 = 40

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [40].
