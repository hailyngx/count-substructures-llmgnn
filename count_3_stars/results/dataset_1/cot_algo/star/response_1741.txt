Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8
Node 1: 0, 4, 5
Node 2: 8
Node 3: 0
Node 4: 0, 1, 9
Node 5: 1, 6
Node 6: 5, 8
Node 7: 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [11] \)

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
