Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 2)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (nodes 3, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (node 1)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (nodes 6, 8, 9)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 7, 8)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 8)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 5, 9)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (nodes 4, 7)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars for each of these nodes. This gives us a total of 20 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [20] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
