Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 has neighbors {2, 6, 7}.
- Node 1 has neighbors {2, 7}.
- Node 2 has neighbors {0, 1}.
- Node 3 has neighbors {4, 7, 8, 9}.
- Node 4 has neighbors {3, 6}.
- Node 5 has neighbors {8, 9}.
- Node 6 has neighbors {0, 4}.
- Node 7 has neighbors {0, 1, 3}.
- Node 8 has neighbors {3, 5}.
- Node 9 has neighbors {3, 5}.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 = 5]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
