Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 2

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 unique 3-stars)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 10] = [12] \)

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>
