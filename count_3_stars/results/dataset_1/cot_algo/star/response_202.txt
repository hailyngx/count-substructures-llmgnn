Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8
- Node 6: 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: Since it only has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 51 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [51] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>
