Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: {3, 8}
- Node 1 neighbors: {2, 5}
- Node 2 neighbors: {1, 7}
- Node 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 4 neighbors: {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5 neighbors: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 6 neighbors: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 7 neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8 neighbors: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 9 neighbors: {3, 6, 7}

Now, we need to count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 4, 9)>,
<4, (3, 6, 7)>,
<5, (1, 7, 8)>,
<6, (4, 7, 9)>,
<7, (2, 4, 5) (4, 5, 8) (4, 6, 9) (5, 6, 9) (5, 7, 9)>
