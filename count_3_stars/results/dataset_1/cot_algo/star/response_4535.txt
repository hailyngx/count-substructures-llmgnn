Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Next, we identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors, which are nodes 2, 5, and 8. 

Now, for each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 1 = 15. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 9)>
