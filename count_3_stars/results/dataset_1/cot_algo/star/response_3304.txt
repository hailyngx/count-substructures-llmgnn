Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 33 3-stars.

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [33], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>
