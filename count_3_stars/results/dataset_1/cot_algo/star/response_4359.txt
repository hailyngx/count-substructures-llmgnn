Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6

Based on the above neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes:

- Node 1 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (6, 9, 3)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (5, 4, 6)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (8, 5, 4)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 6, 4)>
- <5, (4, 2, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 2)>
- <6, (1, 9, 3)>
- <6, (3, 9, 1)>
- <6, (4, 2, 5)>
- <6, (4, 5, 2)>
- <6, (9, 3, 1)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <8, (5, 3, 6)>
- <8, (6, 3, 5)>
- <8, (6, 5, 3)>
