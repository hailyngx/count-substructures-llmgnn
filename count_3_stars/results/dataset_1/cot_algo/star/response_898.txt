Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 14

So, the final result is [14] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 4)>
