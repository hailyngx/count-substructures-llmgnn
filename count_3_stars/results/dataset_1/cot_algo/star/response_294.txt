Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 3, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 = 15

List of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<3, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<3, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<3, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<7, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 5)>, 
<7, (0, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<7, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (7, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (7, 5, 0)>, 
<7, (7, 5, 3)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [15], and the unique 3-stars found are listed above.
