Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 24

Therefore, the final result is [24] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
