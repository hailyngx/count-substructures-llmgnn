Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
