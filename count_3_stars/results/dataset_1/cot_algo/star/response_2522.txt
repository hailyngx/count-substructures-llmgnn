Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 7}

Now, we can identify the 3-star patterns:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [14]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 0)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 0)>, <7, (1, 8, 0)>, <7, (8, 6, 0)>, 
<8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 8)>
