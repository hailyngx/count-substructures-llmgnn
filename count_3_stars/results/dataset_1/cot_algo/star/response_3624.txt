Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10] = 39 \)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (7, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 6)>
<9, (5, 8, 8)>
