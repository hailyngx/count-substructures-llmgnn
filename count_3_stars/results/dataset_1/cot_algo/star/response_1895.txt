Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: No 3-stars formed (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-stars formed (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: No 3-stars formed (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars formed (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-stars formed (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: No 3-stars formed (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-stars formed (has 1 neighbor)
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>
- <9, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (3, 1, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 9)>
