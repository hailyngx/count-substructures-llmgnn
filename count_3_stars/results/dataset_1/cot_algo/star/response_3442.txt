Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 6}

Now, we need to find the 3-stars in this graph. 
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars. Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors can form a unique 3-star with them as the center.
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star: <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star: <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star: <8, (0, 5, 6)>

Now, we need to count the total number of 3-stars, which is 4 in this graph, and represent them inside brackets: [4].
