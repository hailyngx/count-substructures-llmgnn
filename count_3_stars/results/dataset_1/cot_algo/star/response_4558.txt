Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 3, Node 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 
\[ [1 + 10 + 4] = [15] \]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6), (0, 2, 8), (0, 6, 9), (2, 6, 9), (2, 8, 9), (6, 8, 9), (6, 9, 7), (8, 9, 7), (8, 3, 9), (3, 8, 9)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8), (5, 7, 9), (8, 6, 7), (6, 7, 9)>
