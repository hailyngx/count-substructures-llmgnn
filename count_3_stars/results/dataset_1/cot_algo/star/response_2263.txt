Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To begin, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 7

Now, we analyze nodes with three or more neighbors to find potential 3-stars:

- Node 0: has 2 neighbors
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Possible 3-stars with Node 5 as the center: <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 7: has 2 neighbors
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Possible 3-stars with Node 9 as the center: <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 = 8], and the unique 3-stars found are <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>.
