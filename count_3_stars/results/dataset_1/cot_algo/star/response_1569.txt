Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {6, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up: 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 33

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 33. 

Therefore, the answer is [33] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 9, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>
