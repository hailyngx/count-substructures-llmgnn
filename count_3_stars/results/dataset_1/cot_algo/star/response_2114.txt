Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 8
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: neighbors are 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: neighbors are 1, 9
- Node 4: neighbors are 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: neighbor is 2
- Node 8: neighbors are 0, 2, 5
- Node 9: neighbors are 1, 3, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 4 + 1] = 15 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 9, 5)>
<1, (5, 3, 4)>
<1, (5, 3, 9)>
<1, (5, 4, 9)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<1, (9, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 5)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 4)>
