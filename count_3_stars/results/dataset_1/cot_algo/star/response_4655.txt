Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 29 3-stars, which we represent as [29].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the final result is [29], with the unique 3-stars listed above.
