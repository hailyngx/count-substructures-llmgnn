Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information about the graph provided, let's analyze the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors are 5 and 8.
- Node 1: neighbors are 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 2: neighbors are 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 3: neighbors are 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 4: neighbor is 5.
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 6: neighbor is 5.
- Node 7: neighbors are 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 8: neighbors are 0, 1, and 7.
- Node 9: neighbor is 3.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, and 8. That's one 3-star.
- Node 7 also forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, and 8. Another 3-star.
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 5, and 7. One more 3-star.

Counting the total number of 3-stars formed gives us [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, and <2, (1, 5, 7)>.
