Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

For each node, let's calculate their neighbors:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 7, 8}: <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 3, 6}: <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 7, 9}: <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 7}: <1, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4, which can be written as [4].
