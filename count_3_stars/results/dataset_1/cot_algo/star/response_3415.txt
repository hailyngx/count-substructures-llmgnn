Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can determine the 3-star structures present in the graph by examining the neighborhoods of each node.

### Node 0:
- Neighbors: 7
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

### Node 1:
- Neighbors: 6, 7
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

### Node 2:
- Neighbors: 3
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

### Node 3:
- Neighbors: 2, 6, 9
- 1 3-star can be formed with node 3: <3, (2, 6, 9)>

### Node 4:
- Neighbors: 7, 8
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

### Node 5:
- Neighbors: 6, 9
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

### Node 6:
- Neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 8
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed with node 6:
    - <6, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <6, (3, 5, 8)>

### Node 7:
- Neighbors: 0, 1, 4
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

### Node 8:
- Neighbors: 4, 6, 9
- 1 3-star can be formed with node 8: <8, (4, 6, 9)>

### Node 9:
- Neighbors: 3, 5, 8
- 1 3-star can be formed with node 9: <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7
Therefore, the final answer is [7]
