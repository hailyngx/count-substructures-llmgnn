Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {0, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {5}

Now let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star -- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars -- <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>.
