Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually with the given edges:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0,3), (0,7), (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (2,8), (3,0), (3,1), (3,4), (3,8), (4,3), (4,5), (5,1), (5,4), (5,6), (6,1), (6,5), (6,9), (7,0), (7,9), (8,2), (8,3), (9,6), (9,7)

```
   0 --- 3 --- 1 --- 6
   |           |     |
   7           4 --- 5
               |     |
               9     2 --- 8
```

Next, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbor {8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star <6, (1, 5, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4, so the answer is [4].
