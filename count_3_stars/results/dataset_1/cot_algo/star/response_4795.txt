Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}

Now, we will check the nodes that have three or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:

- Node 0 doesn't form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 3 doesn't form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 doesn't form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 7 doesn't form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 doesn't form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and they are:
<1, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>
