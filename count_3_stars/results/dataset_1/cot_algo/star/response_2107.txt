Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 2, 5

Now, we can check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (less than 3)

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 4] = [5] \)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 3, 6)>
