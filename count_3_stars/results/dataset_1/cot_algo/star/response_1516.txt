Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a neighbor list for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star: <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 has 7 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars:
  - <6, (0, 2, 3)>
  - <6, (0, 2, 5)>
  - <6, (0, 2, 7)>
  - <6, (0, 2, 8)>
  - <6, (0, 2, 9)>
  - <6, (0, 3, 5)>
  - <6, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <6, (0, 3, 8)>
  - <6, (0, 3, 9)>
  - <6, (0, 5, 7)>
  - <6, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <6, (0, 5, 9)>
  - <6, (0, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (0, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 3, 5)>
  - <6, (2, 3, 7)>
  - <6, (2, 3, 8)>
  - <6, (2, 3, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 5, 7)>
  - <6, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <6, (2, 5, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (2, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (3, 5, 7)>
  - <6, (3, 5, 8)>
  - <6, (3, 5, 9)>
  - <6, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (3, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (5, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (5, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 1 + 35 = 37, which we can represent as [37].
