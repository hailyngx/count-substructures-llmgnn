Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 3, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors

For each node with three or more neighbors, we can form:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: Only 1 3-star
- Node 6: Only 1 3-star
- Node 7: Only 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [13] \)

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 1)>
- <6, (2, 9, 3)>
- <7, (0, 3, 2)>
