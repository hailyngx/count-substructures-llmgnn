Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: Ineligible (3 neighbors)
- Node 1: Ineligible (4 neighbors)
- Node 6: Eligible (\( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \))
- Node 9: Eligible (\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \))

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 35 + 10 = 45, so we represent this as [45].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<6, (0, 4, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<6, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
