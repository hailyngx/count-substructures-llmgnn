Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 1
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 6, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 3, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 2, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 7, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 4, 8
- Node 8 neighbors: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 3, 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 9. <1, (6, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 6. <8, (2, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, 4. <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
