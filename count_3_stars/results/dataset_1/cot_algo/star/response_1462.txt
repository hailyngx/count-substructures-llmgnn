Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 1: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 5, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we have 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 6 total 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>.
