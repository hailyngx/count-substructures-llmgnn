Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6
- Node 9: 2

Based on the above neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

1. For Node 1: 
   - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
   - Unique 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 7)>

2. For Node 4: 
   - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
   - Unique 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 6)>

3. For Node 7: 
   - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
   - Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>

4. For Node 8: 
   - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
   - Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 6)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us:

\[ [1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [7] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 7.
