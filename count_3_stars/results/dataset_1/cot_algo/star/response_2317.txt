Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

```
      0 -- 9
      |    |
1 -- 7 -- 9 -- 2
|    |    |    |
4 -- 8 -- 5 -- 6
  \  |    |  /
     3 -- 7
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 8. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5.
2. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 10] = 14 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
