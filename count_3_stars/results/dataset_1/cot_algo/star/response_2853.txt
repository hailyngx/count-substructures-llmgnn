Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 7

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
