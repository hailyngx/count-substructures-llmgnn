Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <7, (3, 8, 9)>

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
