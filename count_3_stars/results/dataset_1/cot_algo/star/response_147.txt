Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 0, 1, and 3. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 8
   - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 8)>

2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, and 9
   - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 9)>

3. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 7
   - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, and <3, (0, 2, 7)>.
