Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62

So, there are 62 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [62] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
