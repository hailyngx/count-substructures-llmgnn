Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 (degree = 5)
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9 (degree = 5)
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4 (degree = 3)
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7 (degree = 3)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9 (degree = 6)
- Node 5: 0, 6, 9 (degree = 3)
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 9 (degree = 4)
- Node 7: 1, 3 (degree = 2)
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 9 (degree = 4)
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8 (degree = 5)

Next, we identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the final answer is [58] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
