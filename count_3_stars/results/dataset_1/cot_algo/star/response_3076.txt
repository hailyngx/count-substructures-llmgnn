Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 5, and 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 6 and 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0
- Node 3: Neighbors are 6, 7, and 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 6, 7, and 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0 and 6
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, and 5
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 3, and 4
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0 and 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 3, 4, and 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 5, and 8, creating the 3-star <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 7, and 9, creating the 3-star <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 7, and 9, creating the 3-star <4, (6, 7, 9)>

Count of total 3-stars = [3]
