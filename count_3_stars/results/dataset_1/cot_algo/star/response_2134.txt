Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, we will determine the 3-stars:
- Node 2, 3, and 9 have 5 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 3-star with {(1, 5, 8), (1, 5, 9), (1, 8, 9), (4, 5, 8), (4, 5, 9), (4, 8, 9), (5, 8, 9)}.
- Node 3 forms 3-star with {(0, 5, 7), (0, 5, 9), (0, 7, 9), (4, 5, 7), (4, 5, 9), (4, 7, 9), (5, 7, 9)}.
- Node 9 forms 3-star with {(0, 3, 6), (0, 3, 8), (0, 3, 5), (0, 6, 8), (0, 6, 5), (0, 8, 5), (3, 6, 8), (3, 6, 5), (3, 8, 5), (6, 8, 5)}.

Counting the total 3-stars, we have [15].
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 8, 5>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 8, 5>, <6, 8, 5>.
