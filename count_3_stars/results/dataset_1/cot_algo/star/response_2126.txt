Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {3, 8}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 7}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)> 

So, the final result is [12].
