Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>

Adding them up:
[1 + 1 + 3 + 4] = [9]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 9.
