Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 4: 2, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, the final result is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>.
