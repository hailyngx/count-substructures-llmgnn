Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [14] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
