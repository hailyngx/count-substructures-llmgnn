Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {0}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0: There are 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 3: There are 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star can be formed: <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 6: There are 5 neighbors, so 1 3-star can be formed: <6, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 2, 6)> and <6, (0, 1, 2)>.
