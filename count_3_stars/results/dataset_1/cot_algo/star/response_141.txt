Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 4, 5
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 3, 4
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7
Node 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 6
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 5, 7
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, 7
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 7)>, and <4, (1, 2, 7)>.
