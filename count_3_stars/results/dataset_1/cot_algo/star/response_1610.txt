Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's summarize the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbor {9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 7}

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 (<1, (3, 6, 8)>)
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 (<2, (6, 8, 9)>)
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 (<3, (1, 5, 9)>)
- Node 4: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 (<6, (1, 2, 8)>)
- Node 7: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 (<8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>)
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 (<9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>.
