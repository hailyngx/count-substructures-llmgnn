Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {2, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {0, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \]

Therefore, the final answer is [5], and the unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>.
