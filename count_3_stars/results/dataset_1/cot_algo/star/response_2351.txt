Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
