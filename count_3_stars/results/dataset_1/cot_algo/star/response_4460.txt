Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 7}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {4, 7}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {2, 7}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
  Unique 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 4)>
  
Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
