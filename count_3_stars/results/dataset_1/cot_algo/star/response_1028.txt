Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor nodes {5}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes {2}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes {2}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes {0, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes {7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes {7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes {2, 6, 7, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, and for each such node, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing these up:

4 + 10 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
