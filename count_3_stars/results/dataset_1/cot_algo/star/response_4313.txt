Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 7}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 0\) (Does not form any 3-star)
- Node 2: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) (Forms exactly one 3-star)
- Node 3: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\) (Does not form any 3-star)
- Node 4: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\) (Does not form any 3-star)
- Node 7: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) (Forms exactly one 3-star)
- Node 9: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) (Forms four 3-stars)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \([0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4] = 6\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6, and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 9, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 7, 6)>, <9, (6, 7, 2)>, <9, (7, 2, 6)>
