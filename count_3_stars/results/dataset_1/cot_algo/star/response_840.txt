Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 2, 4, 8
Node 1: 4, 9
Node 2: 0, 4, 8
Node 3: 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 7
Node 6: 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
