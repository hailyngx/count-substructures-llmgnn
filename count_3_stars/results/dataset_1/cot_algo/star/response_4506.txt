Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8}

Now let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 3)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
