Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: forms 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
