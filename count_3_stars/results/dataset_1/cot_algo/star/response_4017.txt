Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 8 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.

For the nodes with 4 neighbors (Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 8), we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
