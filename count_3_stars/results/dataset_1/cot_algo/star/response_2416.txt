Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula:
- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9: Does not form a 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [3].

The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>.
