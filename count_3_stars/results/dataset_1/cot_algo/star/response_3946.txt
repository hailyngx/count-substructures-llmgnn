Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>
