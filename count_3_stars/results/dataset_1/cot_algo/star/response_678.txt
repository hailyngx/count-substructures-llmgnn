Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graph for the given set of nodes and edges is as follows:

Total number of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 3)>
<1, (8, 9, 2)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 5)>
