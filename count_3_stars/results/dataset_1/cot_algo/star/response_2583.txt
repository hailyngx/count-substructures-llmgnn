Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we'll construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {2, 4}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4] = [29] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 4)>
- <4, (3, 8, 4)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
