Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
