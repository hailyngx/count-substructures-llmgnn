Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8

Next, we will find the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

List of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
