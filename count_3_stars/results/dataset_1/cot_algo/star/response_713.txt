Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 8}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {0, 7}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, let's identify the 3-star graphs:
- Node 0: has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 1: has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 2: has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 5: has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 6: has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
    - <7, (0, 3, 8)>
    - <7, (0, 3, 9)>
    - <7, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
    - <8, (1, 2, 6)>
    - <8, (1, 2, 7)>
    - <8, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 9: has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

In total, there are 8 3-stars formed. Thus, the final answer is [8]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 6)>
- <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
