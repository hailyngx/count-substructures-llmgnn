Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 3
Node 2 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 7
Node 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 4, 8
Node 6 neighbors: 4, 7, 8
Node 7 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 5, 6, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 18 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
