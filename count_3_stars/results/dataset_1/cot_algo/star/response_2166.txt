Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To begin, we first need to find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {3}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- The only node with exactly three neighbors is node 2. So, we have 1 3-star: <2, (3, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
