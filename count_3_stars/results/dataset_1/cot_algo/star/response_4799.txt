Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors -> [1 3-star can be formed]
- Node 2: 5 neighbors -> [10 3-stars can be formed]
- Node 4: 3 neighbors -> [1 3-star can be formed]
- Node 5: 4 neighbors -> [4 3-stars can be formed]
- Node 8: 4 neighbors -> [4 3-stars can be formed]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 8) = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 8, 5)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (8, 4, 5)>
- <2, (8, 5, 7)>
- <2, (8, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (8, 4, 5)>
- <5, (8, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
