Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 0, 6
Node 2: 3, 6, 8
Node 3: 2, 6
Node 4: 5, 8, 9
Node 5: 4, 7, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
Node 7: 5
Node 8: 2, 4, 6
Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node:

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Finally, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 15

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>
