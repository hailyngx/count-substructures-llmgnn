Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5
Node 2: 0, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 5
Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 6: 5
Node 7: 0, 8
Node 8: 5, 7
Node 9: 0, 2, 3

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 38 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>
