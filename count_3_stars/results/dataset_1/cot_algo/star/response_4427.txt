Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 1 has neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2 has a neighbor: {1}
- Node 3 has neighbors: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 4 has neighbors: {1, 9}
- Node 5 has neighbors: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 6 has neighbors: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 7 has neighbors: {1, 6}
- Node 9 has neighbors: {0, 3, 4}

Now let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
    - <0, (3, 5, 9)>

- Node 1 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
    - <1, (2, 3, 4)>
    - <1, (2, 3, 5)>
    - <1, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 4, 5)>
    - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (3, 4, 5)>
    - <1, (3, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (3, 4, 7)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 7)>

- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
    - <9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 20 + 1] = 22.
