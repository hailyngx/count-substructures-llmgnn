Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 7}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 10.
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>.
