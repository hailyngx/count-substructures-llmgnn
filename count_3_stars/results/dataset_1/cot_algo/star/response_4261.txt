Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 5: 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 1, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7

Now, we'll determine the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 13, so the final result is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
