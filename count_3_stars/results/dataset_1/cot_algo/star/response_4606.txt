Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can begin by identifying the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 1, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 49.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
