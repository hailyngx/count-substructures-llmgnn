Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {4, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves (4, 6, 9)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves (3, 6, 8)

So, the total number of 3-stars [2] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>.
