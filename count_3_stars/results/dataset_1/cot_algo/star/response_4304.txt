Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {7}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 neighbors or more:

- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

From the list above, nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors. For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [26] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4, 6)>
