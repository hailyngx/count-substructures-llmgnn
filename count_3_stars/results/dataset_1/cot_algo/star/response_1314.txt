Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 different 3-stars
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 different 3-stars
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 different 3-stars
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 different 3-stars
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 24

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
