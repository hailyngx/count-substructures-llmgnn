Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [21]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
