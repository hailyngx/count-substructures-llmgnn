Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes where a 3-star can be formed:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
