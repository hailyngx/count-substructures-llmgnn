Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor: {1}
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: {1, 7}
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: {3, 9}
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: {5, 8}

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with those nodes:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2, 3, 4, and 5 have 3 neighbors each, so each forms 1 3-star.

Total 3-stars: \( [10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [14] \)

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
