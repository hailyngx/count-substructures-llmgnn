Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbor 9
- Node 2: Neighbors 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: Neighbors 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: Neighbor 2
- Node 5: Neighbors 6, 7
- Node 6: Neighbors 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: Neighbors 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors 2, 6
- Node 9: Neighbors 0, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, 8: <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 7, 9, *: <3, (7, 9, *)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7, 8: <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, 9: <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, 7: <9, (0, 3, 7)>

Since each mentioned node forms only one 3-star, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
