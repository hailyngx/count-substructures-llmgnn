Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Summing these up: \([20 + 1] = [21]\)

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (6, 5, 7)>
- <1, (6, 5, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
