Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 6 (1 neighbor)
- Node 3: 0, 6 (2 neighbors)
- Node 4: 5, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: 4 (1 neighbor)
- Node 8: 0 (1 neighbor)
- Node 9: 6 (1 neighbor)

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 9, 6)>
