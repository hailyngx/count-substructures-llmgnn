Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors (form 20 3-stars)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (form 1 3-star)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (form 4 3-stars)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (form 10 3-stars)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (form 10 3-stars)

There are a total of 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 45 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the answer is [45], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (0, 7, 8)>
