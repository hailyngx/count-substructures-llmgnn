Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-stars formed

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 11, so we'll represent this as [11].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
1. <0, (2, 5, 7)>
2. <0, (2, 5, 9)>
3. <0, (2, 7, 9)>
4. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
5. <0, (4, 5, 7)>
6. <0, (4, 5, 9)>
7. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
8. <0, (5, 6, 9)>
9. <0, (5, 7, 9)>
10. <0, (6, 7, 9)>
11. <0, (0, 7, 9)>
