Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0, 4 (2 neighbors)
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 4 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0 (1 neighbor)
- Node 9: 1 (1 neighbor)

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, and 5: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, and 4: <1, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
