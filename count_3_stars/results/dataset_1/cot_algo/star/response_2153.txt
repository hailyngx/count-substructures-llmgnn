Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we will first find all the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 1: 3, 4, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 (6 neighbors)
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 4, 8, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8 (5 neighbors)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 48, so there are a total of 48 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>
