Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 3, 6
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 4
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5 has neighbors: 6, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 4
- Node 8 has neighbors: 5
- Node 9 has neighbors: 6

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation to nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 10] = [16], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 1, 6)>, <0, (2, 1, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 6)>.
