Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 6 and 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2 and 4
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 4, 7, and 8
- Node 3: Neighbor is 4
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, and 6
- Node 5: Neighbor is 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 4, 7, and 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 8: Neighbor is 2
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 6, and 7

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, and 7: <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, and 6: <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 4, and 7: <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 6, and 9: <7, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
