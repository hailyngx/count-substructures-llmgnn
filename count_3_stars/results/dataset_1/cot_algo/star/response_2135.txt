Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (3, 6, 5)>

Counting the total 3-stars found in the graph, we get [5].
