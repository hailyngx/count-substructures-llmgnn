Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 23

So, the total number of 3-stars is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
