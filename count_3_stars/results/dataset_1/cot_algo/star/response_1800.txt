Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [15].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>
