Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 1 neighbors: 2, 7, 8, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8
Node 5 neighbors: 6
Node 6 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-stars are formed
Node 5 has only 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars are formed
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [56].

The unique 3-stars are:
