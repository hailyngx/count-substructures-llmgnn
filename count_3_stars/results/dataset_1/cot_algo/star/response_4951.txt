Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 1, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 1, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are a total of 6 3-stars in this graph. Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, 5, 9>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>

These 3-stars are listed inside <> each only once.
