Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (6 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 2 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1, 3, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 4 (2 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0, 3 (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: 2, 3 (2 neighbors)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, and 7 have 6 neighbors each.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors. 

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, and <2, (1, 3, 9)>.
