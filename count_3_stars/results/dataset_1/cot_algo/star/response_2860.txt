Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 4] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
