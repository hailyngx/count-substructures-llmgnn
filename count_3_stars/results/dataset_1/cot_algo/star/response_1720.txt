Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Node 0 has 1 neighbor (node 7).
2. Node 1 has 1 neighbor (node 9).
3. Node 2 has 2 neighbors (nodes 5 and 8).
   - There are no 3-stars formed with node 2 because it only has 2 neighbors.
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors (nodes 4, 6, 9, and 3). 
   - There is 1 3-star formed with node 3: <3, (4, 6, 9)>.
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors (nodes 3, 7, 9, and 4).
   - There is 1 3-star formed with node 4: <4, (3, 7, 9)>.
6. Node 5 has 1 neighbor (node 2).
7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors (nodes 3 and 8).
   - There are no 3-stars formed with node 6 because it only has 2 neighbors.
8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 4, 8, and 7).
   - There is 1 3-star formed with node 7: <7, (0, 4, 8)>.
9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8).
   - There is 1 3-star formed with node 8: <8, (2, 6, 7)>.
10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9).
   - There is 1 3-star formed with node 9: <9, (1, 3, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>.
