Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {2, 5}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-star graphs they form:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7, which can be represented as [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 2, 6, 7>
- <2, 0, 1, 8>
- <6, 0, 3, 4>
- <6, 0, 4, 5>
- <6, 0, 5, 7>
- <6, 3, 4, 5>
- <5, 6, 8, 9>
