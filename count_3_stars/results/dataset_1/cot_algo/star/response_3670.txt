Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {6, 7}
Node 1 neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
Node 3 neighbors: {2, 6}
Node 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 8}
Node 5 neighbors: {1, 4, 6, 8}
Node 6 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
Node 7 neighbors: {0, 1, 9}
Node 8 neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 9}
Node 9 neighbors: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 1, Node 2, Node 6, and Node 9 can form 3-stars because they each have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [40] \)

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
