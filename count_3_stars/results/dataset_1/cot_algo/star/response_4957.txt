Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 8)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
