Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 3, 5
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the final answer is [41] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 7, 5)>
- <3, (0, 5, 4)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
