Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbor = {4}
- Node 2: Neighbor = {9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbor = {7}
- Node 9: Neighbor = {2}

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>
