Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 5: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 8: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- <7, (2, 3, 6)>
- <7, (3, 4, 5)>
