Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

In total, there are 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final result is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
