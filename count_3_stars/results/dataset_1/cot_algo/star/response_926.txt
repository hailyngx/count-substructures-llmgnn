Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 7}
Node 1: {0}
Node 2: {4, 6}
Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6}
Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 9}
Node 5: {0, 3, 4}
Node 6: {2, 3}
Node 7: {0}
Node 8: {9}
Node 9: {4, 8}

We can see that nodes 0, 3, and 4 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 = 12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 3, 5>
<3, 2, 4, 6>
<4, 2, 3, 9>
