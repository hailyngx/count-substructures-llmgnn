Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 0, 9
Node 2: 7
Node 3: 4, 5, 7
Node 4: 3, 7
Node 5: 3, 7, 9
Node 6: 8
Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 8: 6
Node 9: 1, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 9, and 5: <1, (0, 9, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 5: <3, (4, 7, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 9: <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 9: <7, (2, 4, 9)> and a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5: <7, (3, 4, 5)> and a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 9: <7, (4, 5, 9)>
  
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph: <1, (0, 9, 5)>, <3, (4, 7, 5)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>.
