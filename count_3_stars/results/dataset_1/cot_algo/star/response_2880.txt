Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighborhood of each node:

- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 5, 8} <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 also forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 4, 9} <5, (1, 4, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
