Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}

For the nodes with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 4, 8)
- Node 3: 1 3-star (3, 4, 8)

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 8>
