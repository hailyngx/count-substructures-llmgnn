Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>

So in total, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
