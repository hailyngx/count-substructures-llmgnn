Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with its nodes and edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 7), (5, 2), (5, 9), (6, 3), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 8)
```

Next, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors are 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: neighbors are 2, 9
- Node 2: neighbors are 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: neighbors are 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 7
- Node 5: neighbors are 2, 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 3, 7
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: neighbor is 3
- Node 9: neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed in this graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 7, 9: <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 8, 9: <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 4, 9: <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms multiple 3-stars, so we need to calculate the total number. 
  Applying \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) for node 9. Each unique set of 3 neighbors form a 3-star. 
  The unique 3-stars with node 9 as the center are: 
  <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 (from node 0, 3, 7) + 20 (from node 9) = 24.
So, the final result is [24].
