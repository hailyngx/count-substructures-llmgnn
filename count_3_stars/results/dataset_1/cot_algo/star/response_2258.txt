Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7}

Next, let's check for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11, which we will represent as [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (0, 1, 7)>
- <9, (1, 2, 7)>
- <9, (2, 7, 9)>
