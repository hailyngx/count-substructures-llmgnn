Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 3, 5
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 8
Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6
Node 4: 2, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 6
Node 6: 2, 3, 5
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 9
Node 9: 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 1: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 2: 10C3 = 120
Node 3: 4C3 = 4
Node 5: 3C3 = 1
Node 8: 4C3 = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 120 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 131

Therefore, the final answer is [131] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 3)>
<1, (0, 5, 3)>
<2, (3, 8, 4)>
