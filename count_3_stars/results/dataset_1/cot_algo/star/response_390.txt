Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 5, and 9 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

So, the total number of 3-stars is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
