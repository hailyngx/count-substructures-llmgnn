Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and check if they can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 4: 5 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 7: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 8: 2 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 9: 2 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star

So, we have a total of 4 unique 3-stars: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
