Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {0, 1}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 7}

Now, let's calculate the possible 3-stars:
- Node 0: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \({2 \choose 3} = 0\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \({2 \choose 3} = 0\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({2 \choose 3} = 0\) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \(4 + 1 + 1 = 6\).

Therefore, the answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 1, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 3)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, and <2, (0, 1, 6)>.
