Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 4: 2
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 1, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
1. <1, 6, 8>
2. <1, 9, 7>
3. <2, 4, 7>
4. <6, 1, 8>
5. <7, 2, 9>
