Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor set = {1}
- Node 1: Neighbor set = {0, 5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbor set = {3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbor set = {2, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbor set = {2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbor set = {1}
- Node 6: Neighbor set = {4}
- Node 7: Neighbor set = {1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbor set = {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor set = {4, 8}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
