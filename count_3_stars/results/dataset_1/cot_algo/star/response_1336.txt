Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 20 = 25

Therefore, the final result is: [25] 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 9, 5)>, <2, (6, 1, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>
