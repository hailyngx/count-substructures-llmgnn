Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 5 and 7.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2 and 3.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1 and 8.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1 and 6.
- Node 4: Neighbor is 8.
- Node 5: Neighbor is 0.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 3 and 9.
- Node 7: Neighbor is 0.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2 and 4.
- Node 9: Neighbor is 6.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Has 2 neighbors (5, 7).
- Node 1: Has 2 neighbors (2, 3).
- Node 2: Has 2 neighbors (1, 8).
- Node 3: Has 2 neighbors (1, 6).
- Node 4: Has 1 neighbor (8).
- Node 5: Has 1 neighbor (0).
- Node 6: Has 2 neighbors (3, 9).
- Node 7: Has 1 neighbor (0).
- Node 8: Has 2 neighbors (2, 4).
- Node 9: Has 1 neighbor (6).

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 have 0 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <6, (3, 9, 6)>
- <8, (2, 4, 8)>
