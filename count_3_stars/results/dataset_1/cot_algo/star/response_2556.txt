Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph using the method described earlier.

First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 26.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 4, 6)>, <4, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>.
