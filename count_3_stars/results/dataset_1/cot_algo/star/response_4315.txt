Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 8 have 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 and Node 6 have 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 and Node 9 have 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] is 6.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
