Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6

Now, we will identify the 3-star structures formed:
Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, 6.
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, 9.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 8, 9, 5.
Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 7, 9.
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 7, 9, 5.
Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, 5.
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7 ([]), and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 9, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
