Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor nodes {1, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes {1}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes {1, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes {9}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes {8}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes {3, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes {5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes {1, 4, 7, 8}

Now, we will check for each node which can form a 3-star:

- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 9, 6}
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 7, 8}

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 6)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>.
