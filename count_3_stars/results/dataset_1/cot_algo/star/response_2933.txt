Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: neighbors are 2, 6, 7
- Node 1: neighbors are 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 6
- Node 3: neighbors are 8, 9
- Node 4: neighbor is 1
- Node 6: neighbors are 0, 2, 8
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 1
- Node 8: neighbors are 1, 3, 6
- Node 9: neighbors are 1, 3

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: forms a 3-star
- Node 1: forms a 3-star
- Node 6: forms a 3-star
- Node 8: forms a 3-star
- Node 9: does not form a 3-star

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 3)>
