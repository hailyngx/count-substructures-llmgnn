Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2}

Next, we look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars. In this case, nodes 2, 5, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 3, represented as [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
