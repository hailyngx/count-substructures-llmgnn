Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7}
- Node 1: {8, 9}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 7, 8): <4, (0, 7, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
