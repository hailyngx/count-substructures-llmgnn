Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: [2, 9]
Node 1: [4, 8]
Node 2: [0, 9]
Node 4: [1]
Node 5: [8]
Node 6: [7, 9]
Node 7: [6]
Node 8: [1, 5]
Node 9: [0, 2, 6]

Now, we will go through each node and find its neighbor set:

Node 0: [2, 9] --> neighbors {2, 9}
Node 1: [4, 8] --> neighbors {4, 8}
Node 2: [0, 9] --> neighbors {0, 9}
Node 4: [1] --> neighbors {1}
Node 5: [8] --> neighbors {8}
Node 6: [7, 9] --> neighbors {7, 9}
Node 7: [6] --> neighbors {6}
Node 8: [1, 5] --> neighbors {1, 5}
Node 9: [0, 2, 6] --> neighbors {0, 2, 6}

Next, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they form a 3-star:

Node 0: No 3-star formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 1: No 3-star formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 2: No 3-star formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 6: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 9}. <6, (7, 9)>
Node 8: No 3-star formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 9: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 6}. <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <6, (7, 9)> and <9, (0, 2, 6)>.
