Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 7
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), forms 4 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \), does not form any 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \), does not form any 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), forms 1 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), forms 10 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>.
