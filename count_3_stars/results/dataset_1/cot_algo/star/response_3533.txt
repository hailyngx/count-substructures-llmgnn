Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 5

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 4: 6 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors, can form 2 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1] = 9

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
