Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbor nodes are 9
- Node 1: neighbor nodes are 5
- Node 2: neighbor nodes are 4, 8
- Node 3: neighbor nodes are 5
- Node 4: neighbor nodes are 2, 9
- Node 5: neighbor nodes are 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: neighbor nodes are 5
- Node 7: neighbor nodes are 9
- Node 8: neighbor nodes are 2
- Node 9: neighbor nodes are 0, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
