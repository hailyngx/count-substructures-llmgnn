Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (6 neighbors)
- Node 1: 9 (1 neighbor)
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0, 6 (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 7 (4 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 4)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 9, 4)>, <0, (2, 9, 5)>, <0, (4, 2, 5)>, <0, (4, 2, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 2)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 5)>, <0, (4, 9, 2)>, <0, (4, 9, 5)>, <0, (5, 2, 4)>, <0, (5, 2, 9)>, <0, (5, 4, 6)>, <0, (5, 4, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 4)>, <0, (5, 9, 2)>, <0, (5, 9, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 2)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 5)>, <4, (0, 9, 2)>, <4, (0, 9, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 2)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>
