Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The 3-star graph for the given set of nodes and edges can be analyzed as follows:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8.
2. Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 5.
3. Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9.
4. Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8.
5. Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6.
6. Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 4.
7. Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 4, 7.
8. Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 6, 8.
9. Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7.
10. Node 9 has neighbors: 2.

Node 0, 2, 3, and 8 have 6, 5, 5, and 4 neighbors respectively, which is not enough for forming a 3-star.

So, the only node that has exactly 3 neighbors is Node 1.

Thus, the unique 3-stars and summing them up:
\[ [1] = 1 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1.

The unique 3-star found:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
