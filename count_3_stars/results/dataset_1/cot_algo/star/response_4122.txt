Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 10 + 20 = 40. 

The unique 3-stars are:

- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>
