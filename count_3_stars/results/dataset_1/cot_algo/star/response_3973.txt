Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 1, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we have a total of 7 3-stars, so the final answer is [7].  
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
