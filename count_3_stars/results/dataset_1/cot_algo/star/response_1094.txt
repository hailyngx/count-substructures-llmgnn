Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}

Nodes 2, 4, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (0, 1, 4)>
  - <2, (0, 4, 9)>
  - <2, (1, 4, 9)>
  - <2, (0, 1, 9)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (2, 3, 5)>
  - <4, (2, 3, 6)>
  - <4, (2, 3, 7)>
  - <4, (2, 3, 8)>
  - <4, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <4, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <4, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (3, 6, 7)>
  - <4, (3, 6, 8)>
  - <4, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (2, 5, 6)>
  - <4, (2, 5, 7)>
  - <4, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <4, (5, 6, 7)>
  - <4, (5, 6, 8)>
  - <4, (5, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <4, (2, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (2, 8, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 6, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 8, 9)>
  - <4, (6, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (6, 8, 9)>
  - <4, (7, 8, 9)>
  - <4, (2, 5, 9)>
  - <4, (5, 6, 9)>
  - <4, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (5, 8, 9)>
  - <4, (6, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (3, 5, 6)>
  - <4, (3, 5, 7)>
  - <4, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <4, (4, 5, 7)>
  
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (0, 4, 7)>
  - <8, (0, 4, 9)>
  - <8, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <8, (0, 7, 9)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 35 + 4] = 43, and the unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (4, 5, 7)>.
