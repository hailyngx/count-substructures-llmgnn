Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {6, 9}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4}

Next, we need to find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 5}, giving <3, (0, 2, 5)>.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 7}, giving <6, (2, 4, 7)>.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 4, 3}, giving <9, (0, 4, 3)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3] with the unique 3-stars being <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, and <9, (0, 4, 3)>.
