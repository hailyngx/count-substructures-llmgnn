Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 3, 6

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 8 as the center.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 10 + 1 = 31, so we'll put this final number inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 4)>, <1, (4, 8, 7)>, <1, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 1)>, <1, (3, 9, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 1)>, <4, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 4)>, <4, (1, 8, 7)>, <4, (1, 8, 4)>, <4, (3, 8, 4)>, <4, (3, 8, 1)>, <4, (5, 0, 4)>, <1, (4, 5, 0)>, <1, (5, 0, 4)>

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the graph.
