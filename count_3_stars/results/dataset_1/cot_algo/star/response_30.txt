Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4 forms \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7 forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \([4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [10]\)

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
