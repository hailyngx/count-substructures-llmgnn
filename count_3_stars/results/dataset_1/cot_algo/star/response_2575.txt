Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 3, 8
- Node 2: 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 1, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

So, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars are: <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>
