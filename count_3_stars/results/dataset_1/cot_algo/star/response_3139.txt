Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 19 3-stars. Thus, the final number inside brackets is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (3, 6, 9)>

These unique 3-stars are listed inside <> each only once.
