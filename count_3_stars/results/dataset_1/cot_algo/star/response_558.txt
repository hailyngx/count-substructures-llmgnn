Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 8
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 4, 5, 7

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 27

So, we found 27 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [27].
