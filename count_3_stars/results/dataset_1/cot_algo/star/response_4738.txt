Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 4.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 7, 9.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 4, 8.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 6, 7.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 2, 7.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 9.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 3, 7, 9.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 6.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 9.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 5, 6, 8.

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations:
- Node 1 can form one 3-star: <1, 7, 9>
- Node 2 can form one 3-star: <2, 4, 8>
- Node 3 does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 4 can form one 3-star: <4, 0, 7>
- Node 6 can form one 3-star: <6, 3, 7>
- Node 7 can form one 3-star: <7, 1, 4>
- Node 9 can form one 3-star: <9, 1, 6>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 6, and they are as follows:
<1, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <4, 0, 7>, <6, 3, 7>, <7, 1, 4>, <9, 1, 6> 

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [6].
