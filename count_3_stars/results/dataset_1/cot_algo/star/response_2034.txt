Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighboring nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {3}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 6, 3)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
