Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood set for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 15 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [15] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>.
