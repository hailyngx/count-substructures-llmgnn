Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: neighbors are 3 and 4
- Node 2: neighbor is 7
- Node 3: neighbors are 1, 5, 6, and 7
- Node 4: neighbors are 1 and 7
- Node 5: neighbors are 3 and 8
- Node 6: neighbor is 3
- Node 7: neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8
- Node 8: neighbors are 5 and 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1: Since it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2: Since it has 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3: It forms 1 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 7) and also has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) potential 3-stars.
- Node 4: Since it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5: Since it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6: Since it has 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7: It forms 1 3-star with nodes (3, 4, 6) and also has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) potential 3-stars.
- Node 8: Since it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

Summing up the 3-stars formed:
Total number of 3-stars: \( [ 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 ] = 16 \)

Unique 3-stars:
