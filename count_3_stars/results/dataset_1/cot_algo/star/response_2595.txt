Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this 10-node graph is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
