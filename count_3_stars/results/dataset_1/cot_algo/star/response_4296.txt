Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 = 8.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)> 

So, the final answer is [8].
