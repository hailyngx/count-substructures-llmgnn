Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {7}

By applying the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes that have three or more neighbors, we find:
- Node 1 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [16]

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
