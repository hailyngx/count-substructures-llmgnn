Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 8
Node 2: 1, 5, 7, 9
Node 3: 1, 5
Node 4: 0, 8, 9
Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 6: 1, 9
Node 7: 2, 5, 8
Node 8: 1, 4, 7
Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6

Now, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, there are 19 unique 3-stars in this graph. Listing them:
<1, (2, 6, 8)> 
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (8, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
