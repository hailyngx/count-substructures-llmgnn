Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbor {3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 4, 5} <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 5, 6} <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 2, 6} <5, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, and <5, (1, 2, 6)>.
