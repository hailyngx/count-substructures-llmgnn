Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars around each node (nodes with at least 3 neighbors):
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 20. 

Therefore, the final result is [20] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, and <9, (0, 4, 6)>.
