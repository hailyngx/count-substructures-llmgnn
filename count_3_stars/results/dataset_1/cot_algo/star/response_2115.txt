Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 38 edges, we start by finding the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 4}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 7, 8}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us 40. 

Therefore, the final answer is [40] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 8, 5)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, and additional 35 instances of <8, (0, *, *)> where * represents any of the remaining neighbors of Node 8.
