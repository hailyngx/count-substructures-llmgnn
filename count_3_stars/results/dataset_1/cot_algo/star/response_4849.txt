Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its nodes and edges for better visualization:

Nodes: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4)

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 5}
- Node 9: {4}

Next, we will calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0  (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1  (3-star: <4, (3, 6, 9)>)
- Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0  (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1  (3-star: <6, (4, 5, 7)>)

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars are <4, (3, 6, 9)> and <6, (4, 5, 7)>.
