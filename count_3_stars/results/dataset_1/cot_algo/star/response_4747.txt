Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {7}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 4, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 and its neighbors (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 7 and its neighbors (0, 1, 9) form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 and its neighbors (2, 5, 9) form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20 + 1 + 1] = 22. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
