Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {1, 2}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Node 0, Node 3, and Node 4 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they induce.
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 = 9]. The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
