Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 7 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 1 + 1] = 6 \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 3)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
