Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {3, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 7}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 3, 9}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 2, 8}
Node 4 neighbors: {1, 5}
Node 5 neighbors: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
Node 6 neighbors: {5}
Node 7 neighbors: {1}
Node 8 neighbors: {3, 5}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 2, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star since it has 4 neighbors: <1, (2, 4, 5), 7>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors: <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors: <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star since it has 5 neighbors: <5, (1, 4, 6, 8, 9)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
