Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 7}

Now, let's check for each node if it has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 3, 5, 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 has less than 3 neighbors

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16, so the answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
