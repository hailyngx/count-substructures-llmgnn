Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 7
- Node 5: 2, 6, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form C(4,3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form C(4,3) = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
