Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 7}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, which we will represent as [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
