Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8, which we will represent as [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
