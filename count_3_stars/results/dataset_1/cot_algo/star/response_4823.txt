Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 (has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 (has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 (has 5 neighbors)

Summing up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 20 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
