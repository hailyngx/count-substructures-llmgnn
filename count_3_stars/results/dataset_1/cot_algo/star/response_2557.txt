Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <7, (2, 7, 9)>
