Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 6}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 10 + 1 = 12.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (7, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is 12, and they are listed above.
