Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {4}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 has 3 or more neighbors, so it can form a 3-star with its neighbors: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 unique 3-stars.
  These are: <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, 
            <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 unique 3-stars.
  These are: <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 unique 3-stars.
  These are: <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 19. 
So, the final answer is [19].
