Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 8

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-stars (2 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-stars (1 neighbor)
- Node 2: No 3-stars (1 neighbor)
- Node 3: No 3-stars (1 neighbor)
- Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 6)> (3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars (2 neighbors)
- Node 6: <6, (4, 5, 9)> (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-stars (1 neighbor)
- Node 9: <9, (0, 6, 8)> (3 neighbors)

There are 4 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [4].
