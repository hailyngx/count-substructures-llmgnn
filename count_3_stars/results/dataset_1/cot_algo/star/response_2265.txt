Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {3, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8}

Now, we will determine the number of 3-stars:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [20 + 1 + 0 + 1] = 22 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 2, 9>

So the final answer is [22].
