Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {4, 6}
Node 1: {2, 6}
Node 2: {1, 7, 8, 9}
Node 3: {4, 5, 8, 9}
Node 4: {0, 3, 8, 9}
Node 5: {3}
Node 6: {0, 1, 9}
Node 7: {2, 9}
Node 8: {2, 3, 4}
Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

For Node 2:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3-stars for Node 2: <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>

For Node 3:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3-stars for Node 3: <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>

For Node 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3-stars for Node 4: <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>

For Node 9:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
3-stars for Node 9: <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22

So, the final result is: [22]
And the unique 3-stars found are: <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>
