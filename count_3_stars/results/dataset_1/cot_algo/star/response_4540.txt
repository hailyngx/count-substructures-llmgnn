Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 9}
Node 1: {3, 7, 8}
Node 2: {4, 8}
Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}
Node 4: {0, 2, 8}
Node 5: {3, 8}
Node 6: {0, 9}
Node 7: {1}
Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Node 9: {0, 3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1] = [26] \)

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 0)>
