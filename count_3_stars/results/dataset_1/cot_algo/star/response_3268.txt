Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 9
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 5, 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5. Hence, we put this final number inside brackets: [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <1, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
3. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
4. <1, (4, 5, 6)>
5. <5, (6, 7, 9)>
