Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: inom{1}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: inom{1}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{1}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 (exactly 3 neighbors) => <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 6: inom{1}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom{1}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{1}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: inom{1}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [1]
Unique 3-stars: <5, (4, 6, 9)>
