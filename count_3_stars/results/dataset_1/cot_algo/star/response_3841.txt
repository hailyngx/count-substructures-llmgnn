Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 9
Node 1: 0, 7, 9
Node 2: 7
Node 3: 4, 6, 8
Node 4: 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 8
Node 6: 3, 7
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 7
Node 9: 0, 1, 4

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19, which we will represent as [19].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>
