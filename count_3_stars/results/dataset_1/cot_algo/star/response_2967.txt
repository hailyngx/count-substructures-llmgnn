Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
We start by identifying the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {4, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 6}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 = 9]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 2)>
