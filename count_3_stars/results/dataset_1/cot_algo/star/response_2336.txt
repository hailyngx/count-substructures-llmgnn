Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 7

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7, which can be represented inside brackets as [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
