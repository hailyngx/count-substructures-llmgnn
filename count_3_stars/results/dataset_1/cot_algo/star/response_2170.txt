Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 1, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 20 + 4 + 1] = 29 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
