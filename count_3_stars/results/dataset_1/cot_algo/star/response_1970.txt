Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 6, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star formations:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Total 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 19

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19], and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
