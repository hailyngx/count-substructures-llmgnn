Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 8

Next, we'll identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star. <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star. <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star. <4, (7, 0, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star. <8, (6, 7, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
