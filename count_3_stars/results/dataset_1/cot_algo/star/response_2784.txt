Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars with Node 8 as the center:
    - <8, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <8, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <8, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 4 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars with Node 4 as the center:
    - <4, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <4, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <4, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star:
    - <5, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is 4 (from Node 8) + 4 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 5) = 9.   
So, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>.
