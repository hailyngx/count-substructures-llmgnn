Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

- Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 1: <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 7. Therefore, the final result is [7].
