Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: neighbor is 6
- Node 2: neighbors are 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: neighbor is 0
- Node 4: neighbors are 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: neighbors are 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 2, 9
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 9
- Node 8: neighbor is 4
- Node 9: neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 6, 7

Next, we look at the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 can form inom{3}{3} 3-stars = 1 3-star
- Node 2 can form inom{4}{3} 3-stars = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 can form inom{3}{3} 3-stars = 1 3-star
- Node 5 can form inom{3}{3} 3-stars = 1 3-star
- Node 6 can form inom{3}{3} 3-stars = 1 3-star
- Node 9 can form inom{5}{3} 3-stars = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 18

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 7)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
