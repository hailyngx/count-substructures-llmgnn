Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To solve this problem, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor nodes {4}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes {3, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes {3, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes {1, 2, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes {0, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes {9}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes {2, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes {2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes {1, 5, 8}

Next, we will find the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star because it has 3 neighbors: (2, 3, 6), (2, 3, 8), (2, 6, 8)

Node 3 forms a 3-star because it has 3 neighbors: (3, 1, 8), (3, 2, 8), (3, 8, 9)

Node 8 forms a 3-star because it has 3 neighbors: (8, 2, 3), (8, 2, 9), (8, 3, 9)

Counting the 3-stars from the above combinations, we have a total of [9] 3-stars.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <3, 1, 8>
- <3, 2, 8>
- <3, 8, 9>
- <8, 2, 3>
- <8, 2, 9>
- <8, 3, 9>
