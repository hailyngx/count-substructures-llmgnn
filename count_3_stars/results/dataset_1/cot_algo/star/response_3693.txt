Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we will first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbor {1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor {8}

Now, for the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, there are a total of 32 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>.

Thus, the final result is [32].
