Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 6
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 8

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 17, so we have [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 2, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9, 5>
<8, 7, 4, 1>
<8, 9, 5, 0>
<8, 9, 5, 0>
