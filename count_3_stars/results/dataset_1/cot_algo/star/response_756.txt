Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 0
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 0, 5

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, with 6 neighbors, can form 20 3-stars
- Node 7, with 2 neighbors, cannot form any 3-star
- Nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9 do not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 20, and the unique 3-stars are: 
<[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 4], [0, 1, 7], [0, 1, 8], [0, 1, 9], [0, 2, 4], [0, 2, 7], [0, 2, 8], [0, 2, 9], [0, 4, 7], [0, 4, 8], [0, 4, 9], [0, 7, 8], [0, 7, 9], [0, 8, 9]>
