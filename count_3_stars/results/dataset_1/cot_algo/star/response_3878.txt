Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 8
Node 1: 8, 9
Node 2: 3, 6, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 6
Node 4: 3, 6, 7
Node 5: 8, 9
Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 7: 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 6
Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 7

Now, let's identify which nodes can form a 3-star:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (0, 2, 4, 6)
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (2, 3, 4, 7, 8)
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1, 5, 6)
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (1, 2, 5, 7)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 3 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = 4
Node 6 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars = 10
Node 8 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = 4
Node 9 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: [4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [22]

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
