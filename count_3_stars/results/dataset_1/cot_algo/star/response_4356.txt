Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 6, 8
Node 1: 2, 5
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 7
Node 3: 2, 7
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 1, 7, 8
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 5, 7
Node 9: 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 16 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is [16].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
