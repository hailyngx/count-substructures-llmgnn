Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 7, 8
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0
- Node 4: Neighbors are 5
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 7
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 5
- Node 9: Neighbors are 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>

Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 7.
