Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 20 + 4 = 34.

The unique 3-stars formed in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (3, 2, 6)>
