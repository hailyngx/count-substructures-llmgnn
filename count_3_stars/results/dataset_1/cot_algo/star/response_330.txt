Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 59

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [59], and the unique 3-stars are listed below:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
