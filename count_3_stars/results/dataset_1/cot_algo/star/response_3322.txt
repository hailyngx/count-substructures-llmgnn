Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, 9: <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 3, 4: <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 4, 6: <9, (2, 4, 6)>

There are a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph.
