Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the details of the graph, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes = {5}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes = {5}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes = {3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes = {2, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes = {6}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes = {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes = {4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes = {5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes = {3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes = {2, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors: <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star since it has 5 neighbors: <5, (0, 1, 2)> and <5, (7, 8, 6)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
