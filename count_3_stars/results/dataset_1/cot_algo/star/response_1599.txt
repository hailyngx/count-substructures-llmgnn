Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we can determine the neighboring nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbor {5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbor {0}
- Node 8: Neighbor {4}
- Node 9: Neighbor {0}

Now, we will count the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
