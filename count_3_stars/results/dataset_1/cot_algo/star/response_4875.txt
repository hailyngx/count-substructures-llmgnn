Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {0, 6}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 and Node 8 have more than 3 neighbors each, so we calculate their number of 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, )>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
