Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Since there are 10 nodes in the graph, we will first calculate the number of neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 1 (neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 9)
Node 1: 4 (neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7)
Node 2: 3 (neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6)
Node 3: 3 (neighbors: 0, 4, 9)
Node 4: 5 (neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8)
Node 5: 3 (neighbors: 1, 2, 6)
Node 6: 4 (neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9)
Node 7: 4 (neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8)
Node 8: 4 (neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 9)
Node 9: 4 (neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 8)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (2, 4, 5) -> <1, (2, 4, 5)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (6, 7, 8) -> <4, (6, 7, 8)>
Node 6 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (8, 9, 2) -> <6, (8, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars found inside <> are <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, and <6, (8, 9, 2)>.
