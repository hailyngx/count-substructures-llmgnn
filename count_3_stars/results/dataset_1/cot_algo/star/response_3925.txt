Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:  
Node 0: 1, 6  
Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 9  
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9  
Node 3: 2, 4  
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9  
Node 5: 2, 6, 8  
Node 6: 0, 5, 7  
Node 7: 4, 6, 9  
Node 8: 4, 5  
Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 7  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:  
Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4  
Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10  
Node 4: inom{6}{3} = 20  
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 38  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<1, (2, 4, 9)>  
<2, (1, 4, 9)>  
<4, (1, 2, 9)>  
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
