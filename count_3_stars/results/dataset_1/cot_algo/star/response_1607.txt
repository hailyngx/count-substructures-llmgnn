Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first determine the neighborhood sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, and <3, (2, 4, 8)>.
