Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these up: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
