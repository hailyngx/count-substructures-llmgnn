Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in an adjacency list format:

Node 0: {2, 3, 4}
Node 1: {5, 6, 9}
Node 2: {0, 6, 9}
Node 3: {0, 5, 8}
Node 4: {0, 5}
Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 7}
Node 7: {5, 6}
Node 8: {3}
Node 9: {1, 2, 5}

Now we need to identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: Forms 1 3-star <0, (2, 3, 4)>
Node 1: Forms 1 3-star <1, (5, 6, 9)>
Node 2: Forms 1 3-star <2, (0, 6, 9)>
Node 3: Forms 1 3-star <3, (0, 5, 8)>
Node 5: Forms 1 3-star <5, (1, 4, 9)>
Node 6: Forms 1 3-star <6, (1, 2, 7)>
Node 9: Forms 1 3-star <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
