Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (5, 6, 9)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 2, 4)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 4, 8)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 6, 9)

Counting the 3-stars:
- Total number of 3-stars = [4]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
