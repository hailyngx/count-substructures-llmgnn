Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4
- Node 9: 2, 6

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there's only 1 3-star with this node.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with this node.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there's only 1 3-star with this node.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed with this node.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed with this node.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed with this node.

Adding up the 3-stars we found, we get a total of [1 + 4 + 1] = 6 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, and <5, (0, 2, 4)>.
