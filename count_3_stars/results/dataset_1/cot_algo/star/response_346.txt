Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2, with neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9} forms 4 3-stars: <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, and <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 3, with neighbors {6, 7, 8, 9} forms 4 3-stars: <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, and <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 9, with neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6, 7} forms 10 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, and <9, (3, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 10 = 18, which we represent as [18].
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
