Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4] = [40] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>
