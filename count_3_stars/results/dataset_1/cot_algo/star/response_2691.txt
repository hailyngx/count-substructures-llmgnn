Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13, which we represent as [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <0, (5, 4, 8)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <0, (5, 3, 4)>
- <0, (5, 3, 9)>
- <0, (5, 3, 4)>
- <0, (5, 2, 3)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
