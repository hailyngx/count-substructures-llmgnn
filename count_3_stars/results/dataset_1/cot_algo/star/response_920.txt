Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the neighbors of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7
- Node 3: 0, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 9: 3, 6

Nodes 0, 5, and 8 each have 5 neighbors, so we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10+10+10] = [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- <5, (0, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 8, 5)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (0, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (4, 5, 8)>
