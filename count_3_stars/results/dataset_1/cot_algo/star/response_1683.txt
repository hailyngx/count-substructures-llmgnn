Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 2, 3, 4
- Node 1: neighbors are 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 6: neighbors are 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: neighbors are 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 6
- Node 9: neighbors are 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star (0, 3, 4)
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star (1, 5, 7)
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star (2, 3, 5)
- Node 3 can form 3-stars with any combination of (0, 2, 4, 5) so there are 4 possible 3-stars for node 3: (3, 0, 4), (3, 2, 5), (3, 4, 5), (3, 0, 5)
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star (4, 5, 6)
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star (5, 3, 4)
- Node 6 cannot form a 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star (7, 3, 6)

Counting all the 3-stars, we have a total of [8]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 0, 4>, <3, 2, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 0, 5>, and <4, 5, 6>.
