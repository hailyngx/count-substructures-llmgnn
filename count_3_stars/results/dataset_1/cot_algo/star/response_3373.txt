Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 4
Node 1: 4, 9
Node 2: 0
Node 3: 4, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 5: 4, 8, 9
Node 6: 4, 7
Node 7: 4, 6
Node 8: 3, 4, 5
Node 9: 1, 3, 5

Now, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 = 21

Therefore, there are a total of 21 3-stars formed in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
