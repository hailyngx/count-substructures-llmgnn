Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 6}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star because it has exactly 3 neighbors: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star because it has exactly 3 neighbors: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star because it has exactly 3 neighbors: <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star because it has exactly 3 neighbors: <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star because it has exactly 3 neighbors: <8, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
