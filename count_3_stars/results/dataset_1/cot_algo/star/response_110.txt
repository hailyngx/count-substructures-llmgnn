Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
We can start by listing the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Next, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 5 each have 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 and Node   have 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 and Node 9 each have 3 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 6, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 8, there is 1 3-star.
- For Node 9, there is 1 3-star.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 24.

Therefore, the final result is [24] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <3, 2, 5>
- <3, 2, 6>
- <3, 2, 7>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <6, 5, 7>
- <6, 5, 8>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <6, 7, 5>
- <6, 7, 3>
- <6, 8, 0>
- <8, 6, 3>
- <8, 6, 9>
- <9, 0, 4>
- <9, 0, 8>
- <9, 4, 0>
- <9, 4, 8>
- <9, 8, 0>
- <9, 8, 4>
