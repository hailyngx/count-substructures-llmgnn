Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 7}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {1, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star    <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 1: No 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars   
<7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (9, 0, 2)>, <7, (9, 0, 6)>, <7, (9, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 8: No 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
