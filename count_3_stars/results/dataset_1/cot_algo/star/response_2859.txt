Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 8}

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [22] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5, 8)>
