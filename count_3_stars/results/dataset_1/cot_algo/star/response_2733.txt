Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 1, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
