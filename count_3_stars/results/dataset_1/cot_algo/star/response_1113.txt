Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 3

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 5, so we put it inside brackets: [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>.
