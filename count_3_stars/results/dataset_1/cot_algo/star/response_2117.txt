Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {6}

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, and Node 4 have 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate how many 3-stars are formed with these nodes:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [34] \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
