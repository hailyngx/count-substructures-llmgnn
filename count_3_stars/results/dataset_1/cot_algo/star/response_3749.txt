Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 8

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 16

So, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>
