Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {7, 8}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)]
- Node 3: [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)]
- Node 5: [\( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)]
- Node 6: [\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)]
- Node 7: [\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)]
- Node 8: [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)]
- Node 9: [\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)]

Total 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 30 \)

So, the final number of 3-stars is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
