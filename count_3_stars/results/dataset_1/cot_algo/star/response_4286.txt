Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 4: <1, (0, 5, 8)> and <4, (2, 6, 6)> 
- Node 9: <9, (2, 5, 8)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [3] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 6)>, and <9, (2, 5, 8)>.
