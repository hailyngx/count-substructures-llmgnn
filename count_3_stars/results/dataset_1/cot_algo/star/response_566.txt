Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5

Next, we need to find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8. 

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
