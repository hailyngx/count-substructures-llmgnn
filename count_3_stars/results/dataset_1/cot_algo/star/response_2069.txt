Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 6, 9
Node 1: 8
Node 2: 8
Node 3: 4, 7
Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 6
Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
Node 9: 0, 4, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

For these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [41].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 7, 4)>
