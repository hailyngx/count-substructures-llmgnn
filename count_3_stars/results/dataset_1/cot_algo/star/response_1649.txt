Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20] = 33.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
