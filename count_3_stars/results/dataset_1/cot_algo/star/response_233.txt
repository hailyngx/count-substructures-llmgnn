Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
  Therefore, we have <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>.
  
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
  Therefore, we have <3, (0, 4, 8)>.
  
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
  Therefore, we have <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>.
  
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
  Therefore, we have <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, 
  <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>.

Adding them all up, we have a total of 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 19 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [19].
