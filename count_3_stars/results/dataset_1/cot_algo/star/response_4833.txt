Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph by first finding the neighbors of each node.

Neighborhood sets:
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {4, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 7}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars based on the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: <2, (4, 9, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 4, 9)> and <7, (3, 5, 8)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total} = \left[ \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} \right] = [0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0] = [3] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, and they are:
- <2, (4, 9, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
