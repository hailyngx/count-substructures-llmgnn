Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 5, 9
Node 2: 4, 7, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 8
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 9
Node 7: 2, 4
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 1, 2, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 2 and Node 4 have 3 neighbors each, so they form 1 3-star each. 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars are <2, (4, 7, 8)>.
