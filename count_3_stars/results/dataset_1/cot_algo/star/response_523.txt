Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {0, 1}
- Node 5: {1, 8}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 10 + 10 + 1] = [22] \)

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- <7, (1, 9, 2)>
- <7, (2, 9, 1)>
- <7, (9, 1, 2)>
- <9, (1, 2, 7)>
