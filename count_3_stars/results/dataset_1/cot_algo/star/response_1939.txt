Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 1, 5, 7

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: 
  <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars:
  <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 7)>

There are 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 12 3-stars in total, so we put this final number inside brackets: [12].
