Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edge list:
- Node 1: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (<2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (<7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the final output is: [12]
And the unique 3-stars are: <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>
