Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 7}

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- For node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- For node 5, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- For node 6, there is 1 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- For node 7, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- For node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 29
Therefore, the final answer is [29]
