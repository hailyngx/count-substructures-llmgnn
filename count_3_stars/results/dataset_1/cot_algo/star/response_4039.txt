Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 7}
Node 1: {3}
Node 2: {0, 9}
Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 5: {3, 6}
Node 6: {3, 5}
Node 7: {0, 8, 9}
Node 8: {3, 7}
Node 9: {2, 3, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [23]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
