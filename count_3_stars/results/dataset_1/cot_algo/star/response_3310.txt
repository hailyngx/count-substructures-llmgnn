Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's map out the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 6, 7
Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 2: 0, 3, 5
Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 8
Node 4: 1, 5, 9
Node 5: 2, 4, 6
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 6
Node 8: 1, 3, 6
Node 9: 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>

<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
