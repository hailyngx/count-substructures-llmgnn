Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 3, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32 \), which we represent as [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>.
