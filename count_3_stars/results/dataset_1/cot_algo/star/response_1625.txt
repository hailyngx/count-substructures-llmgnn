Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we'll list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 27 \)

So, the final answer is [27] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (8, 9, 6)>, <8, (8, 9, 9)>, <8, (8, 9, 9)>, <8, (8, 9, 9)>
