Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7
- Node 9: 7

Nodes 0, 5, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 2

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
