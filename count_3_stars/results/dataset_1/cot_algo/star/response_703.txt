Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 5, 6, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: 6 (1 neighbor)
- Node 5: 2, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 7: 5, 8 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 7 (1 neighbor)
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6 (4 neighbors)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with nodes having 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 11

So, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3, 6)>
