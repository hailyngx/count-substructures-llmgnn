Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 6

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, and 6 have 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 and 3 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

So the total number of 3-stars is [10 + 10 + 10 = 30].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
