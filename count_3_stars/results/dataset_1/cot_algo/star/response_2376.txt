Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2: 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7

Now, let's identify any nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [15] in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>.
