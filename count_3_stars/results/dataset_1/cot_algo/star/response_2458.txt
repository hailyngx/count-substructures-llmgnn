Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {6}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 10 + 1 = 15 \), so we put this inside brackets: [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>,
<3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>
