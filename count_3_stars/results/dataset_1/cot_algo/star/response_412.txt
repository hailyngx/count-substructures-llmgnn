Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbor {6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbor {1}

Now, we will look at nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <1, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (0, 6, 4)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <3, (2, 6, 7)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <6, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <6, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <6, (0, 1, 7)>
    - <6, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <6, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <6, (3, 5, 7)>

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us 15. Therefore, the answer is [15].
