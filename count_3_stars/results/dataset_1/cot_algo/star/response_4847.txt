Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 3, 5  
Node 1: 3, 6, 9  
Node 2: 5, 6, 7  
Node 3: 0, 1, 8  
Node 4: 5, 8  
Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 8  
Node 6: 1, 2, 8  
Node 7: 2, 9  
Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 6  
Node 9: 1, 7  

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Summing up these, we get a total of \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 12 \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (3, 6, 9)>  
<2, (5, 6, 7)>  
<3, (0, 1, 8)>  
<5, (0, 2, 4)>  
<5, (0, 4, 8)>  
<5, (2, 4, 8)>  
<6, (1, 2, 8)>  
<8, (3, 4, 5)>  
<8, (3, 5, 6)>  
<8, (4, 5, 6)>  
<8, (5, 6, 8)>  
<8, (4, 6, 8)>
