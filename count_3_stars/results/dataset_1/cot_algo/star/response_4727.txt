Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
