Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 (satisfies condition for 3-star)
- Node 2: 0, 5, 8, 9 (satisfies condition for 3-star)
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 (satisfies condition for 3-star)
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9 (satisfies condition for 3-star)
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7 (satisfies condition for 3-star)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

So, the total number of 3-stars is 44, and they are:
