Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 24 \]

So, there are 24 3-stars in this graph.
