Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 6}

Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8 have 5, 4, 5, and 4 neighbors respectively, so they can form 5C3 + 4C3 + 5C3 + 4C3 = 35 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
