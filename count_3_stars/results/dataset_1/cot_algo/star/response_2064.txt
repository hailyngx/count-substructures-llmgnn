Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 5, 7

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

\[ [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10] = [20] \]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 

- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <5, (0, 7, 9)>
