Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format:

Node 0: 3, 9
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 1, 6
Node 3: 0, 6, 8
Node 4: 5, 6, 9
Node 5: 4, 7, 9
Node 6: 2, 3, 4
Node 7: 5, 8, 9
Node 8: 3, 7
Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 0: [0, 3, 9] → <0, (3, 9)>
For Node 3: [0, 3, 6, 8] → <3, (0, 6, 8)>
For Node 4: [5, 6, 9] → <4, (5, 6, 9)>
For Node 5: [4, 7, 9] → <5, (4, 7, 9)>
For Node 6: [2, 3, 4] → <6, (2, 3, 4)>
For Node 7: [5, 8, 9] → <7, (5, 8, 9)>
For Node 9: [0, 4, 5, 7] → <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 8, and they are: 
<0, (3, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>
