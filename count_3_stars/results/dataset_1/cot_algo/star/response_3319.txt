Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 3

Next, we look for nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars. In this case, only Node 3 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found in this graph is <3, (2, 4, 5)>.
