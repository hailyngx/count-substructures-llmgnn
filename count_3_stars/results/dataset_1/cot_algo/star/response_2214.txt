Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 35 = 43

So, the final answer is [43] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
