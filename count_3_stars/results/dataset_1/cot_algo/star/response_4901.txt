Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (7, 8, 6)>
