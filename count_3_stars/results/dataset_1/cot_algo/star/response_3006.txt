Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 7}

Now we will check the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These are:
  - <2, (0, 1, 8)>
  - <2, (0, 1, 9)>
  - <2, (0, 8, 9)>
  - <2, (1, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star:
  - <3, (6, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These are:
  - <7, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <7, (1, 4, 9)>
  - <7, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <7, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 9, and they are:
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
