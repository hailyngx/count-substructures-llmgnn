Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 19 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 4)>, <0, (5, 6, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>
