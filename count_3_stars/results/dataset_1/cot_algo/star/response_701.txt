Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 6
- Node 1 neighbors: 7, 8, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 6, 7
- Node 3 neighbors: 4, 5
- Node 4 neighbors: 3, 7
- Node 5 neighbors: 3
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 2, 4
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 6
- Node 9 neighbors: 1

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 6, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 7, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3 and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)> 

So, the final answer is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>.
