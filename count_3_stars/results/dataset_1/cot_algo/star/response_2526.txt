Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes {5}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes {8}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes {5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes {5}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes {7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes {5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes {1, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes {2, 5}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 5 have 3 or more neighbors.

For Node 2:
- There are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars with Node 2.

For Node 5:
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 5: 
  <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>.
