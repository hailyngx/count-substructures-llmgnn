Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Does not have enough neighbors.
- Node 1: Does not have enough neighbors.
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 6, 9).
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 7, 9).
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes (3, 5, 6).
- Node 5: Does not have enough neighbors.
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 2, 4) and a 3-star with nodes (3, 4, 7).
- Node 7: Does not have enough neighbors.
- Node 8: Does not have enough neighbors.
- Node 9: Does not have enough neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4] and they are:

- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
