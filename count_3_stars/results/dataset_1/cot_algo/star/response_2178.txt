Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>

Summarizing the total number of 3-stars: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>
