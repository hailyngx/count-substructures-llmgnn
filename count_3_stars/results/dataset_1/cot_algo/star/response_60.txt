Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, hence it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)> are the 3-stars involving node 0.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, hence it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 9, 9)> are the 3-stars involving node 2.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, hence it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)> are the 3-stars involving node 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4 + 4] = 18.
