Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: No 3+ neighbors
- Node 1: No 3+ neighbors
- Node 2: No 3+ neighbors
- Node 3: No 3+ neighbors
- Node 4: No 3+ neighbors
- Node 5: No 3+ neighbors
- Node 6: No 3+ neighbors
- Node 7: No 3+ neighbors
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: Forms 4 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 5

So, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
