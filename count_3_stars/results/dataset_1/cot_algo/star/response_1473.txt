Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 4, 5) <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 3 also forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 4, 5) <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 also forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 3, 6) <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 7, 0) <9, (2, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
