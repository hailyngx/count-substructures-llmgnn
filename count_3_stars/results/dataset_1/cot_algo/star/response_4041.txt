Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 1: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 2: <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars with node 6: <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
