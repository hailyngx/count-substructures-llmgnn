Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 20 = 57 \)

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [57], and the unique 3-stars found are:
