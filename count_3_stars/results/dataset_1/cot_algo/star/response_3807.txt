Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0,5), (0,8), (0,9), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (3,6), (4,2), (4,3), (4,8), (5,0), (6,3), (6,7), (6,8), (7,2), (7,6), (8,0), (8,2), (8,4), (8,6), (8,9), (9,0), (9,2), (9,8)

Now, let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 9
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 3
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 8
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 0
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 8

Since nodes 2, 3, 8 have 5 or more neighbors, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 8) = 31. 

Therefore, the answer is [31] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>.
