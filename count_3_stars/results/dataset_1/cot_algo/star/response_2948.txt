Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbor {2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbor {6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8}

Next, we'll check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars.

- Node 0 and Node 4 have 2 neighbors each, so they don't form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 is the only node with 3 or more neighbors (3 neighbors).
- Applying \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), there is 1 3-star formed with Node 8. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1, which we denote as [1].

The unique 3-star found is:

<8, (4, 5, 9)>
