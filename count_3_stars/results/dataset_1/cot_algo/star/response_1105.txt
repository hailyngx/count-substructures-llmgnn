Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 8, 9}: <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 6, 8}: <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 1, 9}: <6, (0, 1, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
