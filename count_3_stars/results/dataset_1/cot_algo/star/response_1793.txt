Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 2, 3, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is 17, so the final answer is [17].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
