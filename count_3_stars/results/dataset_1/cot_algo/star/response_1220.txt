Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 6
- Node 3: Neighbors are 5, 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 5, 7
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: Neighbor is 9
- Node 9: Neighbor is 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 7: <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, 7: <5, (0, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
