Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a table to represent the neighbors of each node:

| Node | Neighbors         |
|------|-------------------|
| 0    | 2, 3, 5, 7        |
| 1    | 3, 5              |
| 2    | 0, 3, 5, 7        |
| 3    | 0, 1, 2, 7, 9     |
| 4    | 5, 6, 9           |
| 5    | 0, 1, 2, 4, 7     |
| 6    | 4, 7              |
| 7    | 0, 2, 3, 5, 6    |
| 9    | 3, 4              |

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors for each node:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
