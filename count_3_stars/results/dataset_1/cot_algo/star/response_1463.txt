Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {2, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 7, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:
- Nodes 2, 5, and 8 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 * (inom{4}{3}) = 16 3-star graphs.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in this graph is [16].

The unique 3-star graphs are:
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
<8, (5, 9, 9)>
<8, (9, 6, 7)>
