Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 5) + 4 (from Node 8) = 10

So, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>
