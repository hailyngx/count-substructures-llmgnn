Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 7 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 3: \( \text{inom}{7}{3} = 35 \)
- For node 8: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 35 + 4 = 39

Therefore, the final answer is [39] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (5, 9, 8)>
