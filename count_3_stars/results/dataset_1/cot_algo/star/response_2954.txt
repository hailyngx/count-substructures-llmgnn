Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {}
- Node 9: {0, 1}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 2)>

Since each of these nodes has exactly three neighbors, each 3-star is unique and appears only once.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
