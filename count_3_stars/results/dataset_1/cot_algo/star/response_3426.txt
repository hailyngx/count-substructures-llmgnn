Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>
