Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 1, 9
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding all 3-stars together: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.

So, there are 7 unique 3-stars:
\[ <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)> \]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
