Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 1 3-star <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 2: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1 3-star <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 4: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 1 3-star <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 8: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1 3-star <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>
