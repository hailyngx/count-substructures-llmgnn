Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 7 3-stars. Thus, the answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, and <8, (0, 5, 7)>.
