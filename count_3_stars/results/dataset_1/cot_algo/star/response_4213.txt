Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9}, Degree 1
- Node 1: Neighbors {6}, Degree 1
- Node 2: Neighbors {6}, Degree 1
- Node 3: Neighbors {6}, Degree 1
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6, 7, 9}, Degree 4
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 8, 9}, Degree 3
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}, Degree 6
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6}, Degree 2
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9}, Degree 2
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}, Degree 5

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:
