Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 3, 4, 6
Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 8
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 5: 1, 2
Node 6: 0, 4, 7
Node 7: 6, 8
Node 8: 2, 3, 7
Node 9: 1, 3, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <2, (1, 4, 8)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <3, (0, 1, 4)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <9, (1, 3, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
