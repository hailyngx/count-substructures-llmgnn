Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following structure:  

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, with 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1, with 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3, with 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These are <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, and <3, (0, 4, 9)>.
- Node 8, with 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5, with 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 3-stars.  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, and <8, (0, 1, 5)>.
