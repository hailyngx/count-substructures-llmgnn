Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star structures in this graph can be determined by examining the neighbor sets for each node. 

Node 0 has neighbors: 4, 8
Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 8
Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 5, 8
Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 9
Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 7, 8
Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
Node 9 has neighbors: 3, 7

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 4 has 7 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 only has 4 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 also only has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 also has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, forming \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is then \( [35 + 10 + 20] = [65] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>
