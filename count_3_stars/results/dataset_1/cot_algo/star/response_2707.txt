Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars is 1. Thus, the final result is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <2, (0, 7, 9)>.
