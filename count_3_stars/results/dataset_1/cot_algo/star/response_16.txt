Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the graph can be found by analyzing each node and its neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 6, 8, 9}. There are 4 choose 3 3-stars: <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)> - total 4.
  
- Node 1: Neighbors {5}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}. There are 3 choose 3 3-stars: <2, (0, 5, 8)>

- Node 3: Neighbors {9}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7, 9}. There are 3 choose 3 3-stars: <4, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}. There are 3 choose 3 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 4)>

- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 9}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 8}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 9}. There are 4 choose 3 3-stars: <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)> - total 4.

- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}. There are 5 choose 3 3-stars: <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)> - total 5.

Total 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 5 = 15
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, and <5, (1, 2, 4)>.
