Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (4, 7, 9): <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 8, 9): <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors (5, 7, 8): <9, (5, 7, 8)>

There are 3 unique 3-stars found, so the total number of 3-stars is [3].
