Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {9}
Node 1: {2, 4, 7}
Node 2: {1, 7, 8}
Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 9}
Node 6: {4}
Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 9}
Node 8: {2, 9}
Node 9: {0, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 9
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 4

For nodes with 3 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For the node with 4 neighbors, there are:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars formed.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [1 + 4] = [5].

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>.
