Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 7}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 16 \)

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
