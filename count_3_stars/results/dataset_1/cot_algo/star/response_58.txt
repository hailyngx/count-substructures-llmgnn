Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 6, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 1 = 12, and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>.
