Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 2, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 7}: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 7}: <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 2}: <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 9 forms 10 distinct 3-stars with its neighbors:
  - <9, (3, 4, 5)>
  - <9, (3, 4, 6)>
  - <9, (3, 4, 7)>
  - <9, (3, 5, 6)>
  - <9, (3, 5, 7)>
  - <9, (3, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <9, (4, 5, 7)>
  - <9, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>.
