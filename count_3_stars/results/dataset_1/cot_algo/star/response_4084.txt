Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 7}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, 
<0, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<0, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<4, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<5, (0, 3, 6)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<9, (2, 4, 7)>.
