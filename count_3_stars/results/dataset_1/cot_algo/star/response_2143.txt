Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 --- 1 --- 2
|     |     |
|     |     |
3 --- 4     6
  \       \ /
   \       5
    \     / \
      8 --- 7
          |
          9
```

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 8  
Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9  
Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7  
Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 5, 8, 9  
Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 2  
Node 5 has neighbors: 3, 6, 8  
Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7  
Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8  
Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9  
Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 3, 8  

Calculating inom{n}{3} for each node with 3 or more neighbors:  
Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4  
Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10  
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4  
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10  

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 4 + 10] = 28  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 3, 8)>  
<1, (0, 2, 6)>  
<3, (0, 5, 8)>  
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
