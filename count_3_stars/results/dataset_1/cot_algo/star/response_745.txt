Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3}
Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 2: {4, 6}
Node 3: {0, 9}
Node 4: {2, 6}
Node 5: {1, 9}
Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 7}
Node 7: {1, 6, 8}
Node 8: {7}
Node 9: {1, 3, 5}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 5)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 2)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 7, 2)>, and <9, (1, 5, 3)>.
