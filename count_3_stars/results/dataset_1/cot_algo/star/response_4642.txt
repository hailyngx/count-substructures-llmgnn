Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
2. Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 5)>
3. Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 8)>
4. Node 3: <3, (1, 4, 5)>
5. Node 3: <3, (1, 4, 8)>
6. Node 3: <3, (1, 5, 8)>
7. Node 3: <3, (2, 4, 5)>
8. Node 3: <3, (2, 4, 8)>
9. Node 3: <3, (2, 5, 8)>
10. Node 3: <3, (4, 5, 8)>

Since all the 3-stars are centered at node 3, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
