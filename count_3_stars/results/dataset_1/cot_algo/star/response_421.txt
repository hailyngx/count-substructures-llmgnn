Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 6 is not connected to any other node.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 0, 7)>
