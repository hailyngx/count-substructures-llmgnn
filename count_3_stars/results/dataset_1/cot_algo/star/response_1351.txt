Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 1 + 35] = 44

Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
