Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {6, 8}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 3}

By applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors, we find:

- Node 0 does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
