Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 4, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 6

Next, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to see if any 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9) - can form 1 3-star
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 6) - can form 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 7) - can form 1 3-star
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9) - can form 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 4, as indicated by [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
