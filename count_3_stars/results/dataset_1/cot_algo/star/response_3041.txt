Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form a 3-star with 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 1 can form a 3-star with 9, 2, and 7.
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with 9, 0, and 7.
- Node 9 can form a 3-star with 1, 3, and 5.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4. 
Therefore, the answer is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (9, 2, 7)>
- <3, (9, 0, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
