Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, here is the process to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
