Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Now, we'll check which nodes have three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 5)>, <5, (1, 7, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>

Since each 3-star is unique, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 5 + 4] = 14. 

Therefore, the final result is: [14]
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 5)>, <5, (1, 7, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>
