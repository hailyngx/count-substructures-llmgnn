Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 8}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 8}

Next, let's count the 3-stars:
- Node 1, 4, and 5 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [7] \]

List of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (5, 1, 7)>
- <1, (4, 1, 5)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
