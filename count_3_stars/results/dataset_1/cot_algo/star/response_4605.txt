Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we'll find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 7

Next, we'll identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star:
- Node 0 and Node 2 have 4 neighbors each
- Node 1, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8 have 3 neighbors each

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- For Node 0 and Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars each
- For Node 1, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star each

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12 = [12]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
