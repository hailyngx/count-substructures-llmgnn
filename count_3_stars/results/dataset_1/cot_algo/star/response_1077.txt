Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph given:

```
0 -- 3 -- 4
|  / |      |
5 -- 2 -- 1
|     /    |
7 -- 9 -- 6
```

Now, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {2, 3}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, which we'll represent as [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (5, 2, 7)>
- <0, (5, 2, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
