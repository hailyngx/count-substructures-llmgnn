Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7

Nodes 1, 4, and 7 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will have  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations starting from each of these nodes. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 12, and they are:
<1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>
