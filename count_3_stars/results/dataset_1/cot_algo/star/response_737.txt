Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 7}
Node 1: {2, 3, 5}
Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 9}
Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 7}
Node 5: {1, 7}
Node 6: {2, 7, 8, 9}
Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 6}
Node 8: {6, 9}
Node 9: {2, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 6 total 3-stars with its neighbors.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 total 3-stars with its neighbors.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 total 3-stars with its neighbors.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 total 3-stars with its neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 total 3-stars with its neighbors.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 6 total 3-stars with its neighbors.

Adding these up gives a total of 24 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [24] and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>.
