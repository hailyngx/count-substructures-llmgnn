Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 6
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 4
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 4

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 10.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (8, 4, 9)>, 
<4, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>
