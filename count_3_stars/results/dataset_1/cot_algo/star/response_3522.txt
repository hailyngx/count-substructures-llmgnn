Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {4, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Thus, there are \(4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 21\) 3-stars in the graph.
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
