Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 4, 5, and 9
- Node 2: Neighbor is 9
- Node 3: Neighbor is 8
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 5, and 6
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 4, and 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 4 and 9
- Node 7: Neighbor is 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 3 and 5
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 2, 6, and 7

Now, we will check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 4, 5, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

For nodes with 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star.
For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, the number of 3-stars is calculated using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

From the calculations, we find:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 4 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7, which can be written as [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>

These form the 3-stars in the given graph.
