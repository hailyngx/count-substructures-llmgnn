Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 5), forming 1 unique 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 5)>.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 8), forming 1 unique 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <7, (1, 4, 5)> and <6, (2, 4, 8)>.
