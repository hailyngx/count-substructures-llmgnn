Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 0, 1, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 7
Node 4: 0, 6, 8
Node 5: 6, 8
Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 8: 4, 5
Node 9: 2, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 0, Node 6, and Node 7 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars. 

Applying the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 10 + 10 = 30]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
