Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9.
   - 3-star formed with node 0: <0, (1, 2, 5)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
   - 3-star formed with node 1: <1, (0, 6, 9)>

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
   - 3-star formed with node 2: <2, (0, 4, 6)>

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.

9. Node 8 is connected to node 7.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
   - 3-star formed with node 9: <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
