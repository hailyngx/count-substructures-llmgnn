Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 9
Node 2: 1, 5, 8
Node 3: 4, 6, 7
Node 4: 0, 3, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
Node 6: 3, 5, 7
Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 6
Node 8: 2, 4
Node 9: 1

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the contributions, we get a total of 26 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [26]
And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>.
