Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each applicable node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{7}{3} = 35
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 35 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 0 = 48

So, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
