Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 8
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 8, and Node 9 can form 3-stars because they have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 26

So, the final answer is [26] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>
