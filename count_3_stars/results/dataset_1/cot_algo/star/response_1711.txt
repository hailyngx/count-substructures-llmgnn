Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, let's analyze the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}

Now let's check for 3-stars. 
From the analysis, we see that nodes 0, 1, and 5 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars. 
Nodes 2, 8, and 9 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they can also form 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 1, and 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Nodes 2, 8, and 9 can form 1 3-star each.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( [4*3 + 1*3] = 15 \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
