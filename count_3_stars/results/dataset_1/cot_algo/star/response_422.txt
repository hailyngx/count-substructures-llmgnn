Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node in the graph:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6
- Node 6: 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 1, 6

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Yes
- Node 3: Yes
- Node 4: Yes
- Node 5: Yes
- Node 6: Yes
- Node 7: Yes

Next, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \(  \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \(  \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \(  \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \(  \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \(  \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (4, 0, 5)>
- <3, (5, 0, 4)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
