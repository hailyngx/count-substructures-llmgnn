Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 7

We observe that nodes 0, 2, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 + 4 = 18, which we will represent in brackets as [18].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>

These are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph.
