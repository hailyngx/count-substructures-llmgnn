Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {8}
Node 1: {2, 3}
Node 2: {1, 7, 8, 9}
Node 3: {1, 7}
Node 4: {7, 9}
Node 5: {7, 8}
Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 5}
Node 8: {0, 2, 5}
Node 9: {2, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (<2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (8, 9, 1)>)
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (<7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (<8, (0, 2, 5)>)
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = [4 + 4 + 1] = 9

The unique 3-stars are:

<2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (8, 9, 1)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>
