Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 3, 8}
- Node 8: neighbor {7}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 4, 6}

Next, we identify 3-stars formed by the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 4}. <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 5, 9}. <6, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
