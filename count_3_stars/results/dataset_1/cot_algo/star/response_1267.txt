Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 7, 9
Node 1: 5, 6
Node 2: 6, 7
Node 3: 8
Node 4: 5
Node 5: 1, 4, 9
Node 6: 1, 2
Node 7: 0, 2, 8
Node 8: 3, 7
Node 9: 0, 5

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 7

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>
