Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 8

Since nodes 5 and 8 each have 4 neighbor nodes, they can form 4 3-stars each:
- Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>,  <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 3)>, <8, (4, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
