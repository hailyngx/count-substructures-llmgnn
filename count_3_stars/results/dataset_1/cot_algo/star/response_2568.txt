Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}
- Node 10: {}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( [] = 4 + 1 = 5 \)

List of unique 3-stars:
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
