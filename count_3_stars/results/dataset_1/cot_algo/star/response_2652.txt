Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 9: 1

Next, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

So, the answer is [3] and the unique 3-stars are: <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>.
