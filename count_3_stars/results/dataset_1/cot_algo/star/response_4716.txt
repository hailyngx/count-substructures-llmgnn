Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Next, let's check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 2 and Node 3 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
