Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars found are <4, (5, 8, 1)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>.
