Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. 

Therefore, the result is [6] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>.
