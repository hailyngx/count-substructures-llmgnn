Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1}
- Node 9: {3, 7}

Next, we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 10

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>.
