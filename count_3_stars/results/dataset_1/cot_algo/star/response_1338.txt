Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 32

So, the total number of 3-stars is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <7, (0, 1, 6)>
