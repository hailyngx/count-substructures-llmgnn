Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Since the given graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges, it is not a 3-star graph. However, we can analyze the graph to find any 3-star structures. 

Let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
