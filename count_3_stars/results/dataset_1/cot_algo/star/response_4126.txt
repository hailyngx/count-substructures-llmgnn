Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 5
Node 1: 0, 4, 9
Node 2: 5, 6, 8
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 1, 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 2, 3
Node 6: 2, 7, 8
Node 7: 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 2, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's check which nodes can form 3-stars:

Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [3], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
