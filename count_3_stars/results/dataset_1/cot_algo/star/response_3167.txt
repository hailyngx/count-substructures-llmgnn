Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 2, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, and Node 6 have 5 neighbors each.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the final result is [19] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>.
