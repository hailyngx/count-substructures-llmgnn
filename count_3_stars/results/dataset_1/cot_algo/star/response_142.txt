Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list all the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 9
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 4, 6
Node 3: 9
Node 4: 0, 2
Node 5: 1, 8
Node 6: 2, 7
Node 7: 6
Node 8: 5
Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Thus, there are no 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [0].
