Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we will first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 5, 6, 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 2, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 2, 6
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8

Next, we will find the total number of 3-stars and list the unique ones:

Total number of 3-stars = [ inom{n}{3} ] = [ inom{10}{3} ] = [ 120 ] = 120

Therefore, there are 120 3-stars in the given graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 6, 2)>
<8, (1, 9, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
