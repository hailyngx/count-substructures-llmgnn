Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12, so the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
