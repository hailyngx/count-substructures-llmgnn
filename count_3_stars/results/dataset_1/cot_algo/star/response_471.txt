Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 5}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:
- Node 0: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 1: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 16
So, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars are <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, and <8, (3, 4, 5)>.
