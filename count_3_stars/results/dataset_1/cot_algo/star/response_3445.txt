Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 2 both have 3 neighbors each, so for each of them, there is one unique 3-star:
   - Node 1: <1, (2, 7, 9)>
   - Node 2: <2, (1, 6, 7)>

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars, we have [2].
