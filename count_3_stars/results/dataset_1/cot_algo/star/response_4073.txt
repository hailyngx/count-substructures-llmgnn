Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 (degree 5)
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7 (degree 3)
- Node 2: 0, 4 (degree 2)
- Node 3: 1, 7, 9 (degree 3)
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6 (degree 3)
- Node 5: 8 (degree 1)
- Node 6: 4, 7, 9 (degree 3)
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 6 (degree 4)
- Node 8: 0, 5 (degree 2)
- Node 9: 3, 6 (degree 2)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with a degree of 3 or more:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: No 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 3: No 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16

Thus, the final result is [16] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
