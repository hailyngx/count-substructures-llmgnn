Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (3, 5, 6)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 6, 8)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 7, 9)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes (6, 7, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
