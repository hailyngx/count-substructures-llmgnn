Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8
- Node 10: No neighbors

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: <5, (1, 4, 7)> - forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Overall, there are 4 + 1 + 4 = 9 3-stars in this graph: 
<5, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>
