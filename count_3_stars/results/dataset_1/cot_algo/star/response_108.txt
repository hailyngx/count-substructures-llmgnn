Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: neighbor {4}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 5: neighbor {6}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's look at the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 have 3 or more neighbors.
- For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
  - Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 3: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 4: \( inom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
  - Node 6: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
  - Node 7: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 9: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
