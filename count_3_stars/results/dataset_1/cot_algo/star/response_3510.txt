Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 6, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 32

So, there are a total of 32 3-stars in the given graph, and they can be represented as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
