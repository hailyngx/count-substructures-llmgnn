Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information about the graph provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2 and 6.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3 and 5.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 9: Neighbor is 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives a total of 21 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21], and the unique 3-stars found are:  
<2, (0, 4, 7)>  
<3, (1, 6, 7)>  
<4, (2, 7, 8)>  
<5, (1, 6, 8)>  
<6, (0, 3, 7)>  
<7, (2, 3, 6)>  
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
