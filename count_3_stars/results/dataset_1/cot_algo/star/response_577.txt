Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 6}

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24], and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
