Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
For each node, let's first list its neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 7  
Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6  
Node 2: 1  
Node 3: 5, 6, 7  
Node 4: 5, 6, 8  
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7  
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8  
Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8  
Node 8: 4, 6, 7, 9  
Node 9: 8  

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
<0, (1, 6, 7)>  
<0, (5, 6, 7)>  
<0, (1, 5, 6)>  
<0, (1, 5, 7)>

Node 1: Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.  
<1, (0, 5, 6)>  
<1, (0, 5, 7)>  
<1, (5, 6, 7)>  
<1, (0, 6, 7)>

Node 3: Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
<3, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 4: Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
<4, (5, 6, 8)>

Node 5: Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
<5, (0, 1, 6)>  
<5, (0, 4, 6)>  
<5, (0, 6, 7)>  
<5, (1, 4, 6)>  
<5, (1, 6, 7)>  
<5, (3, 4, 6)>  
<5, (3, 6, 7)>  
<5, (4, 6, 7)>  
<5, (0, 1, 7)>  
<5, (0, 3, 6)>

Node 6: Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
<6, (0, 1, 7)>  
<6, (3, 4, 7)>  
<6, (0, 4, 5)>  
<6, (1, 4, 5)>  
<6, (0, 3, 7)>  
<6, (1, 3, 7)>  
<6, (4, 5, 7)>  
<6, (0, 1, 5)>  
<6, (4, 5, 8)>  
<6, (0, 3, 4)>  
<6, (1, 3, 4)>  
<6, (5, 7, 8)>  
<6, (0, 1, 4)>  
<6, (3, 5, 7)>  
<6, (0, 5, 7)>  
<6, (1, 5, 7)>  
<6, (3, 5, 6)>  
<6, (4, 7, 8)>  
<6, (0, 5, 6)>  
<6, (1, 5, 6)>

Node 7: Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
<7, (0, 3, 6)>  
<7, (5, 6, 8)>  
<7, (0, 5, 6)>  
<7, (3, 6, 8)>  
<7, (0, 5, 8)>  
<7, (5, 7, 8)>  
<7, (0, 3, 5)>  
<7, (6, 8, 9)>  
<7, (0, 6, 8)>  
<7, (3, 5, 8)>

Node 8: Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.  
<8, (4, 6, 7)>  
<8, (6, 7, 9)>  
<8, (4, 6, 9)>  
<8, (6, 7, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 54\).  
So, the final answer is [54].
