Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we'll determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbor {6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7}

Now, we will check the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, we can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6] and the unique 3-stars are: 

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
