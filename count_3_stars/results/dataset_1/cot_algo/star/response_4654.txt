Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 1, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 7

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors for potential 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, 8, and 7 have three neighbors each.
- Node 6 also has three neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the final result is [36] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
(0, 1, 2), (1, 0, 6), (1, 0, 7), (1, 0, 8), (1, 6, 7), (1, 6, 8), (1, 7, 8), (1, 7, 9), 
(8, 0, 1), (8, 0, 4), (8, 0, 5), (8, 0, 6), (8, 0, 7), (8, 1, 4), (8, 1, 5), (8, 1, 6), 
(8, 1, 7), (8, 1, 9), (8, 6, 7), (8, 6, 9), (8, 7, 4), (8, 7, 6), (8, 7, 9), (8, 9, 7), 
(7, 1, 3), (7, 1, 6), (7, 1, 8), (7, 1, 9), (7, 3, 4), (7, 3, 9), (7, 4, 8), (7, 6, 8), (7, 6, 9), 
(6, 1, 7)
