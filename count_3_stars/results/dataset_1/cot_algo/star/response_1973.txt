Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 4 and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0, Node 2, and Node 6 have 2 neighbors each, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 = 8

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
