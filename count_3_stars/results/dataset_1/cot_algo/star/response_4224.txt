Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors = {2, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors = {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors = {0, 4, 6}
- Node 3: neighbors = {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors = {2}
- Node 5: neighbors = {1}
- Node 6: neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors = {0, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors = {3, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 3 and Node 9 both have 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each.
   - 3-stars for Node 3: <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 9, 7)>
   - 3-stars for Node 9: <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 3)>, <9, (6, 8, 3)>, <9, (7, 8, 3)>
- Node 0, Node 2, and Node 6 each have 3 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each.
   - 3-star for Node 0: <0, (2, 7, 9)>
   - 3-star for Node 2: <2, (0, 6, 4)>
   - 3-star for Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [11] \).
