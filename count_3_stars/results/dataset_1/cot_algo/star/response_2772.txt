Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6, 7

Next, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 4 = 9 3-stars. 
So, the final answer is [9], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, and <9, (0, 1, 6)>.
