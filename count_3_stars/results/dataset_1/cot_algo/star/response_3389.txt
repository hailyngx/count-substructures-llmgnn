Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 12, so the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
