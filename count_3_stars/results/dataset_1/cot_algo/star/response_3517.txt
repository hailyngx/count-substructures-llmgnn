Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 8, 9)>, 
<1, (5, 3, 8)>, 
<1, (5, 3, 9)>, 
<1, (5, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
