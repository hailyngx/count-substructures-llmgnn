Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
   - Possible 3-stars: [inom{7}{3}] = 35

2. Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 8
   - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

3. Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6
   - Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

4. Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 2
   - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

5. Node 4 has neighbors: 5, 6
   - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

6. Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 9
   - Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

7. Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8
   - Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

8. Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 5
   - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

9. Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6
   - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

10. Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 5
   - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: 35 + 4 + 4 = 43

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
