Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 2, 3, and 5. 

For node 2:
- Neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 0, 1, 7
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 7)>

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 2, 4, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 1 + 1 = 12]
