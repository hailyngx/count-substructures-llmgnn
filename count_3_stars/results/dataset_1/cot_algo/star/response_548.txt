Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 5}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: forms 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
