Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually to better understand its structure:

```
    0 --- 6 --- 2 --- 8
  / |   / |       |
1   | 5   |       |
   \ | /   |       |
    4 --- 7       |
        |         |
        9 --------
```

Now, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 4, 5, and 6 have 4 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate for them:
  - For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  
Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 20] = [28] \)

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
