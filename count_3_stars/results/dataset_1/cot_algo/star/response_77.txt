Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1 neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3 neighbors: {2, 4}
- Node 4 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 5 neighbors: {0}
- Node 6 neighbors: {2, 7}
- Node 7 neighbors: {6, 9}
- Node 8 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 9 neighbors: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 4, 8. So, <1, (2, 4, 8)>.
Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 8. So, <2, (1, 4, 8)>.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 9. So, <4, (1, 2, 9)>.
Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 9. So, <8, (1, 2, 9)>.

The total number of 3-stars is 4. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
