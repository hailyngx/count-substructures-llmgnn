Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 3 and 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2 and 8
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 6, and 7
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 4, and 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 5, and 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 4 and 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2 and 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2 and 5
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0 and 1
- Node 9: Neighbors are 3, 4, and 6

Next, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- For node 2: inom(3, 3) = 1
- For node 3: inom(3, 3) = 1
- For node 4: inom(3, 3) = 1
- For node 9: inom(3, 3) = 1

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
