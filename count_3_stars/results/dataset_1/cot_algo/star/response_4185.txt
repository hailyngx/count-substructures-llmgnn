Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually: 

```
  1-----7
  |     |
  2--3--8
     | 
     4--6
     |  |
     5--9
```

Now, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: 0 3-stars (only has 1 neighbor)
- Node 2: 0 3-stars (only has 1 neighbor)
- Node 3: 1 3-star (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0 3-stars (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0 3-stars (only has 1 neighbor)
- Node 6: 1 3-star (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0 3-stars (only has 1 neighbor)
- Node 8: 0 3-stars (only has 1 neighbor)
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (only has 1 neighbor)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 = 2, so we have [2].

The two unique 3-stars are: 
1. <3, (2, 4, 8)>
2. <6, (4, 5, 9)>
