Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 7

Next, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 7

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is 8, which we'll represent inside brackets as [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 7), (1, 4, 7), (3, 4, 7)>
