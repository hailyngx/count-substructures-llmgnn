Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 5, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 6: neighbor {2}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 7}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 2, 7}
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 3, 5}
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 4, 7}
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 4, 8}

Therefore, we have [4] 3-stars in total: <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>.
