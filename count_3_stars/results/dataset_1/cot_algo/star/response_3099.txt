Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16 \)

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 0)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the final result is:
\[ [16] = 16 \]
