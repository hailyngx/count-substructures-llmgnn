Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 4: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 4 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 3-stars: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 8, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they can also form 4 3-stars each: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, but that's not enough to form a 3-star
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough
- Node 6 and Node 7 have 2 neighbors each, so they cannot form any 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 4 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 1) + 4 (from Node 3) + 4 (from Node 4) + 4 (from Node 8) + 4 (from Node 9) = 24

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 2)>
- <0, (3, 7, 4)>
- <1, (3, 7, 4)>
- <1, (4, 8, 6)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (4, 9, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 6)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 9, 6)>
- <4, (3, 7, 0)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (4, 1, 6)>
- <8, (4, 1, 9)>
- <8, (6, 9, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
- <9, (4, 8, 6)>
- <9, (4, 8, 1)>
- <9, (4, 8, 6)>
