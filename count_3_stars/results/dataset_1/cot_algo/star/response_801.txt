Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 3-stars: 
<2, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 7)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 8, so the final answer is [8].
