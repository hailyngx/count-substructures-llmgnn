Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 2
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: \[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \] 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors:  \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors:  \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars up: 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 34

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (7, 9, 3)>
<2, (7, 9, 5)>
<2, (7, 9, 8)>
<7, (9, 5, 3)>
<7, (9, 5, 8)>
<7, (9, 3, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
