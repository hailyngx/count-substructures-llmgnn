Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 3

Now let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1: Not possible (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 7) - forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: Has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 8, 9) - can form 4 3-stars
- Node 4: Not possible (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: Has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 8) - can form 4 3-stars
- Node 6: Has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 5) - forms 1 3-star
- Node 7: Not possible (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: Has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5) - forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: Not possible (has less than 3 neighbors)

In total, there are 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>
