Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {5, 6}

Next, we can determine the 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
