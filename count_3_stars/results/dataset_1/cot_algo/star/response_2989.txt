Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars and the unique 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {3}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {7}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {7}

Now, we need to check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 3, 4, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

For Node 3:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (since it has only 2 neighbors)

For Node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (since it has only 2 neighbors)

For Node 8:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (since it has only 2 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all nodes, we have:
Total number of 3-stars = 0

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
