Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6

Next, let's apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Counting the total number of 3-stars:  
\( [] = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 6 \)

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>
