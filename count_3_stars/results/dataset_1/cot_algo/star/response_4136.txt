Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {6, 8, 9}
Node 1: {2, 3, 8}
Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 8}
Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 4: {3}
Node 5: {2, 8}
Node 6: {0}
Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
Node 9: {0, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars using the neighbor sets:

Node 0: [1 3-star]  
Node 1: [1 3-star]  
Node 2: [1 3-star]  
Node 3: [1 3-star]  
Node 8: [1 3-star]  

The total number of 3-stars is 5.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
