Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3
- Node 9: 3, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [0 3-stars]
- Node 1: [0 3-stars]
- Node 2: [0 3-stars]
- Node 3: [1 3-star] <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: [0 3-stars]
- Node 5: [0 3-stars]
- Node 6: [1 3-star] <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 7: [0 3-stars]
- Node 8: [0 3-stars]
- Node 9: [0 3-stars]

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Therefore, the final result is: [2]
