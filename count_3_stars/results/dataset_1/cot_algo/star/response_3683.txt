Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {3, 9}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the only nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 6, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (6, 8, 9)>.
