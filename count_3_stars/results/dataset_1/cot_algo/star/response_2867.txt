Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 2: 0, 9
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7, 8

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the final result is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
