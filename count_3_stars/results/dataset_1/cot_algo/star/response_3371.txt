Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 (degree = 5)
- Node 1: 0, 4 (degree = 2)
- Node 2: 6 (degree = 1)
- Node 3: 0, 5, 9 (degree = 3)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9 (degree = 6)
- Node 5: 3, 4 (degree = 2)
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4 (degree = 3)
- Node 7: 4, 8 (degree = 2)
- Node 8: 0, 7, 9 (degree = 3)
- Node 9: 3, 4, 8 (degree = 3)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the final answer is [33] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 4, 9)>.
