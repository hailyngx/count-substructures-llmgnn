Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 2, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 6, 9
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
