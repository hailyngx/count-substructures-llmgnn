Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 3}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {2, 6}

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 0] = 33

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
