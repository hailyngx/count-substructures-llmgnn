Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbor (4)
- Node 1: neighbors (2, 4, 6)
- Node 2: neighbors (1, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 3: neighbor (6)
- Node 4: neighbors (0, 1, 8, 9)
- Node 5: neighbor (6)
- Node 6: neighbors (1, 3, 5)
- Node 7: neighbor (2)
- Node 8: neighbors (2, 4)
- Node 9: neighbors (2, 4)

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 4, 6) <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 8, 9) <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 1, 8) <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 1, 9) <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 8, 9) <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 3, 5) <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 4, 9) <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 4, 8) <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
