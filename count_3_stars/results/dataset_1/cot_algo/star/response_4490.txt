Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Since there are 10 nodes and the graph is undirected, the total number of possible edges in the graph can be calculated using the formula \( \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2} \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes. 

For this graph with 10 nodes, the total possible edges would be \( \frac{10 \cdot 9}{2} = 45 \). However, we are given that there are 32 edges, so the graph is not complete.

Let's first construct the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 4}

Now we'll check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form no 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form no 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form no 3-star
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form no 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars gives us \( [10 + 10] = 20 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 3)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (0, 4, 2)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 2)>
- <6, (5, 7, 2)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
