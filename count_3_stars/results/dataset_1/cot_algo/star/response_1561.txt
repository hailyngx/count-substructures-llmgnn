Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 7
Node 1: 7, 9
Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 8
Node 4: 2, 5, 6
Node 5: 2, 3, 4
Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 8
Node 7: 0, 1
Node 8: 2, 3, 6
Node 9: 1

Now, we need to find the 3-stars in this graph. We look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of. 

Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>

Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 4, 6)>

Node 4: 4 choose 3 =  4
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 2, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 3, 6)>

Node 5: 3 choose 3 = 1
<5, (2, 3, 4)>

Node 6: 4 choose 3 =  4
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 3)>
<6, (4, 3, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>

Node 8: 4 choose 3 =  4
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 4)>
<8, (3, 6, 4)>
<8, (6, 3, 4)>

So the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 27.

Therefore, the answer is [27].
