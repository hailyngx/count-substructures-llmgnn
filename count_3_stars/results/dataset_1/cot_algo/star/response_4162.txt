Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 1, 6}
- Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with the following combinations:
     - <6, (3, 4, 5)>
     - <6, (3, 4, 8)>
     - <6, (3, 4, 9)>
     - <6, (3, 5, 8)>
     - <6, (3, 5, 9)>
     - <6, (3, 8, 9)>
     - <6, (4, 5, 8)>
     - <6, (4, 5, 9)>
     - <6, (4, 8, 9)>
     - <6, (5, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 6) = 11, so the answer is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 1, 6)> and all 10 combinations from node 6.
