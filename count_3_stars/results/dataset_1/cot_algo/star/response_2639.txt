Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 6}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

There are a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<2, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<7, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 2, 8)>.
