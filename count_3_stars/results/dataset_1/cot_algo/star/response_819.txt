Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
