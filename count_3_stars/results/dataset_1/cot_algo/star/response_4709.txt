Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Based on the given edges, the graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 -- 5 -- 6
    |    |    |
    7 -- 9 -- 2
    |         |
    3 -- 4 -- 8
      \    /
        0
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 1 neighbor (node 3).
Node 1 has 4 neighbors (nodes 5, 6, 7, 9).
Node 2 has 5 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, 9).
Node 3 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 4, 9).
Node 4 has 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 7, 8).
Node 5 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 6, 9).
Node 6 has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 5, 8, 9).
Node 7 has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 4, 9).
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, 6).
Node 9 has 7 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Adding them up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 35 = 65

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [65], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
