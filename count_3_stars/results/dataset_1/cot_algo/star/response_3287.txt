Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 4}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {7}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars using the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Thus, there are a total of \( [1 + 1] = 2 \) 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <8, 7, 9>
