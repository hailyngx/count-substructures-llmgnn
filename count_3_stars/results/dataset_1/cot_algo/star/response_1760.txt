Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

- Node 0 neighbors: 3, 8
- Node 1 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2 neighbors: 4, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 7, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 6
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 3, 5, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1 forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \({7 \choose 3} = 35\) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \(10 + 10 + 35 = 55\), and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 5)>, <1, (5, 8, 4)>
