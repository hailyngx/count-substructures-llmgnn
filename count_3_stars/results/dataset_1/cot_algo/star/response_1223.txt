Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
For this graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we will first find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Now, we will identify the 3-star configurations:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 4, 9).
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, there is only one 3-star in this graph, which is centered at node 6 and includes nodes 1, 4, and 9. 

Putting this final count in brackets, we have: [1].
The unique 3-star found in this graph is: <6, (1, 4, 9)>.
