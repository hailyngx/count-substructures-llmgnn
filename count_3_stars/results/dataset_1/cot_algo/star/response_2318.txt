Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30] with unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 8, 5)>, <1, (2, 6, 4)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 2, 6)>, <1, (5, 3, 8)>, <1, (6, 2, 4)>, <1, (8, 0, 5)>
