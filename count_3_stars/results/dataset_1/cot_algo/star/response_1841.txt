Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 3, 5, and 7 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 2 and 8 have 4 neighbors each.

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with them:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 40, which can be shown as [40].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
