Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor set = {5}
- Node 1: Neighbor set = {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbor set = {4, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbor set = {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor set = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbor set = {0}
- Node 6: Neighbor set = {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor set = {1, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbor set = {1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbor set = {3, 4, 6}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 20 + 4 = 34]

Listing unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
