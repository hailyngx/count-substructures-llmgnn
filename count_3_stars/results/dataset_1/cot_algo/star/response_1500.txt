Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor set = {1}
- Node 1: Neighbor set = {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbor set = {1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbor set = {2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbor set = {1, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbor set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbor set = {1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor set = {1, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 3: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 9: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 4 = 24. 

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>.
