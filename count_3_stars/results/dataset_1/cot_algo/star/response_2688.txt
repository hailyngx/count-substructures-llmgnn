Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 6, 7

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Therefore, the final result is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <7, (2, 9, 6)>
