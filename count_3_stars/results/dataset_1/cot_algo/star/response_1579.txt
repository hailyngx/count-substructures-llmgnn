Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format to better visualize the connections:

0: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
1: [0, 8, 9]
2: [0, 5, 7, 9]
3: [0, 6, 9]
4: [0]
5: [2]
6: [3, 8]
7: [0, 2]
8: [1, 6, 9]
9: [1, 2, 3, 8]

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the final answer is [21], and the unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
