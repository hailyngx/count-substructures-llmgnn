Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed starting from each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 20. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (8, 7, 9)>
