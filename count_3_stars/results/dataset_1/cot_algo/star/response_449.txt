Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [12]

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
