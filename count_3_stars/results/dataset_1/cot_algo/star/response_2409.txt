Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors: Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8.

For these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 17 3-stars: [17]

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
