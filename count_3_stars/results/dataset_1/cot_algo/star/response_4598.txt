Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
