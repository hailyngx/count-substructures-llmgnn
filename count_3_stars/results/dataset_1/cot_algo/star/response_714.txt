Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 4, 5

Nodes 4 and 2 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 10 three-star graphs overall. 
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 three-star graph.
Node 0, 5, and 6 have 2 neighbors each, which is not enough to form a three-star graph.
Nodes 3, 8, and 9 have 1 neighbor each, which is also not enough to form a three-star graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 11. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
