Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

1. Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7}
2. Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
3. Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6, 7}
4. Node 4: Neighbors {8, 9}
5. Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
6. Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 7}
7. Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
8. Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4}
9. Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 5}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 4 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 8 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14, which we represent as [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (6, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 2)>, <9, (5, 2, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>.
