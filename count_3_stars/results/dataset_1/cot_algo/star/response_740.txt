Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 9}
- Node 4: {}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {3}
- Node 10: {}

Now, for the nodes with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( [4 + 4 + 4] = [12] \)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 6, 5)>
