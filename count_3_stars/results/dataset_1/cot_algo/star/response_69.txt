Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {2, 6}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 5: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 9: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [4].

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>.
