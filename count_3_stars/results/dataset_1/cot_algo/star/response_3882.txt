Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 7}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 4, 7, and 9 have more than 3 neighbors.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10]

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (8, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
