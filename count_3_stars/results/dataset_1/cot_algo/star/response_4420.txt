Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 1: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 2: Can form 3-stars. (1)
- Node 3: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 4: Can form 3-stars. (1)
- Node 5: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 6: Can form 3-stars. (2)
- Node 7: Can form 3-stars. (1)
- Node 8: Can form 3-stars. (3)
- Node 9: Can form 3-stars. (3)

Counting the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 4) + 2 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) + 3 (from node 8) + 3 (from node 9) = 11

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [11].

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
