Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [inom{4}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} ] = 15. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 7, 8)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
- <9, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
