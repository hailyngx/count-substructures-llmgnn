Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \(20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42\)

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [42].
