Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 7}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed in this graph:

- Node 1: Since Node 1 has 5 neighbors, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 1 as the center. These are:
    - <1, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <1, (4, 5, 9)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <1, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <1, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (6, 8, 9)>

Thus, there are 10 3-stars with Node 1 as the center.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
