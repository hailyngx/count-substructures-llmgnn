Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1 3-star
- Node 4: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4 3-stars <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4 3-stars <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 9: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10 3-stars <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19
So, the final answer is [19]
