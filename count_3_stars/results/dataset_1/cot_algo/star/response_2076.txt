Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 2, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors as potential centers for 3-stars:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each potential center:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10] = 24. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (8, 9, 1)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (9, 2, 1)>
- <2, (1, 9, 7)>
- <7, (0, 6, 3)>
