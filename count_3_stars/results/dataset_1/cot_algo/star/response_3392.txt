Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's go through the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.

Next, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Number of 3-stars = [3 + 3 + 3] = [9]

Finally, we list the unique 3-stars:

- <0, 2, 4>
- <2, 0, 4>
- <4, 1, 8>
