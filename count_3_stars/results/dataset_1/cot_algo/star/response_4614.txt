Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 1: It has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 2: It has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 3: It has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 6: It has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars:
<6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>,
<6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 26, so the answer is [26].
