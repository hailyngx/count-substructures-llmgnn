Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors are 5, 8, 9
2. Node 2: Neighbors are 3, 7, 8
3. Node 3: Neighbors are 2
4. Node 4: Neighbors are 7
5. Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 6, 9
6. Node 6: Neighbors are 5, 7
7. Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 4, 6
8. Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 2
9. Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 5

Now, we need to check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4. Now let's list the unique 3-stars found:

\[ \text{[4]} \]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>
