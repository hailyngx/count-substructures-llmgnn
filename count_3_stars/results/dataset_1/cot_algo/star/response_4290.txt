Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up, there are 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 19 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 2)>
<9, (7, 8, 3)>
<9, (7, 2, 3)>
<9, (8, 2, 3)>
<9, (7, 8, 3)>
