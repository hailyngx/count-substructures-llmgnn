Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 3
- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6
- Node 4 neighbors: 2, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 3, 5, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 2
- Node 8 neighbors: 2, 5, 6
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, 8 <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 6, 9 <5, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
