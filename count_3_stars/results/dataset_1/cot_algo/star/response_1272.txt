Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5

Next, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 6
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8), (3, 4, 9), (3, 5, 8), (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
