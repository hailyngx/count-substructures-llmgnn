Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 7 neighbors: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 + 35 + 1 + 1 = 43, so we put this inside brackets: [43].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
