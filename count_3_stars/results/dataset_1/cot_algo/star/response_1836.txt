Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4
- Node 9: 0, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (3, 4, 8) - <4, (3, 8, 5)>
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, there is 1 3-star in this graph: <4, (3, 8, 5)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
