Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We will first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}

Now we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 and Node 5 form a 3-star with neighbors {1, 8, 9} <0, (1, 8, 9)>.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 9, 4} <1, (8, 9, 4)>.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 9, 5} <8, (1, 9, 5)>.
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it has only 4 neighbors.

There are 3 unique 3-stars found: <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (8, 9, 4)>, and <8, (1, 9, 5)>.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
