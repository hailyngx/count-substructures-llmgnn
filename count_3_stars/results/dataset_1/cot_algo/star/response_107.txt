Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 7, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 2, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

For node 1, the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), resulting in 4 unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (6, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 3)>

Similarly, for node 8, the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), resulting in 4 unique 3-stars:
<8, (0, 5, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (1, 5, 3)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 8, so the final answer is [8].
