Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we'll find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 0, 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of 15 3-stars. Therefore, the final count is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 1, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (6)>
<6, (4, 8, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 2)>
<8, (1, 6, 0)>
