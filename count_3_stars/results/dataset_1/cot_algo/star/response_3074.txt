Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 has inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 23 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [23].
