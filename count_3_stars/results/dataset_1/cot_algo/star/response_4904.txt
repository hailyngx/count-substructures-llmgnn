Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6}

Considering the neighbor sets, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 unique 3-stars)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 unique 3-stars)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 unique 3-stars)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 37. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
