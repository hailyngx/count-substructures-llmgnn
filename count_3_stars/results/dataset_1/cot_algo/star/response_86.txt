Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To begin, we will first determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges. Then we will identify the 3-stars in the graph.

### Neighbors of Each Node:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3

### 3-Stars in the Graph:
- There are 4 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
  - Node 2 can form 3-stars with neighbors (4, 8, 9) → <2, (4, 8, 9)>
  - Node 3 can form 3-stars with neighbors (1, 6, 7), (1, 7, 9) → <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>
  - Node 8 can form 3-stars with neighbors (2, 5, 7) → <8, (2, 5, 7)>
  - Node 9 can form 3-stars with neighbors (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 9) → <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 9)>

### Final Result:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 9)>.
