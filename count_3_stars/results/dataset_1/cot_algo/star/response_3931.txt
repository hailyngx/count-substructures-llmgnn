Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 6, 9
Node 1: 2, 5, 6
Node 2: 1, 6
Node 3: 5, 8
Node 4: 0, 6
Node 5: 1, 3, 6
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
Node 7: 6
Node 8: 3, 9
Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>.
