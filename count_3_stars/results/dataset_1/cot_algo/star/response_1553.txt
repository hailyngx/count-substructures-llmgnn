Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 7}

Now, we can see that nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
