Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbor {6}
- Node 2: Neighbor {8}
- Node 5: Neighbor {6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 4 = 9 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 6, 9)>
