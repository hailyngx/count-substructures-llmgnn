Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Since only nodes 1 and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, we have a total of 2 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 7, 8>
<7, 1, 6>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
