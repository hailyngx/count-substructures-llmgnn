Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 8, 9}
Node 1: {5}
Node 2: {3, 8}
Node 3: {0, 2, 5}
Node 4: {5, 9}
Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6}
Node 6: {5}
Node 8: {0, 2}
Node 9: {0, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 8, 9}, giving <0, (3, 8, 9)>.
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 5}, giving <3, (0, 2, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
