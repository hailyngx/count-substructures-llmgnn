Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 7)>.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 18, so the final answer is [18]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 7)>.
