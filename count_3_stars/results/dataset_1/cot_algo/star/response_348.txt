Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 4: (0, 2, 6), (0, 2, 8), (0, 6, 8), (2, 6, 8)
- Node 8: (0, 4, 6), (0, 4, 9), (0, 6, 9), (4, 6, 9)

There are 8 unique 3-stars in total, so the final result is [8]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
