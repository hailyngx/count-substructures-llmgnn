Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 8}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
