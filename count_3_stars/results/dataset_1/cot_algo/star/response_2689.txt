Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 38 edges, we need to first identify the 3-stars in the graph.

For each node, let's list its neighbors:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the final result is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
