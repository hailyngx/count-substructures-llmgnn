Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>.
