Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 9
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>
