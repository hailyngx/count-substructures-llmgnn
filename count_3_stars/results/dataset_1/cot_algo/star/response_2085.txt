Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16, which we represent as [16].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>.
