Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 9}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star with neighbors: <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star with neighbors: <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star with neighbors: <4, (3, 5, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
