Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0:  neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 1:  neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 2:  neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 3:  neighbors {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 4:  neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 5:  neighbors {0}
- Node 6:  neighbors {1, 2, 8}
- Node 8:  neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 9:  neighbors {3}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 3, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [8] \)

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
