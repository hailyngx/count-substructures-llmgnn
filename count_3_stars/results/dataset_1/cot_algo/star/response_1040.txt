Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list down the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
