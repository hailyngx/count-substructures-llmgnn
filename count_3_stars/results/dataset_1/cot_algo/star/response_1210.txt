Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 9
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)]
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <1, (6, 9)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars. [\( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)]
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars. [\( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 20 = 53 

Therefore, the final result is [53] with the unique 3-stars being <1, (6, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, and <3, (0, 2, 9)>.
