Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7
- Node 2: 7
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 7, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
