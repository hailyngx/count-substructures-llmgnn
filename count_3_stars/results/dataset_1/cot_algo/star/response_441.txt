Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: (1, 4, 5)
Node 1: (0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9)
Node 2: (3, 4)
Node 3: (1, 2, 4, 8)
Node 4: (0, 2, 3)
Node 5: (0, 8)
Node 6: (1, 7, 8)
Node 7: (1, 6, 8)
Node 8: (1, 3, 5, 6, 7)
Node 9: (1)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by examining nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: [20 + 4 + 1 + 10] = 35

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
