Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, we can now determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 8. Possible 3-stars: [1]. Unique 3-stars: <<0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 8>>.

2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 7. Possible 3-stars: [4]. Unique 3-stars: <<1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 7>>.

3. Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 4, 7. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it does not form any 3-star.

4. Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 6. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it does not form any 3-star.

5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8. Possible 3-stars: [4]. Unique 3-stars: <<4, 1, 2>, <4, 1, 6>, <4, 1, 8>, <4, 2, 6>>.

6. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9. Possible 3-stars: [10]. Unique 3-stars: <<5, 0, 1>, <5, 0, 6>, <5, 0, 8>, <5, 0, 9>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 1, 8>, <5, 1, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>>.

7. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8. Possible 3-stars: [10]. Unique 3-stars: <<6, 0, 3>, <6, 0, 4>, <6, 0, 5>, <6, 0, 8>, <6, 3, 4>, <6, 3, 5>, <6, 3, 8>, <6, 4, 5>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 5, 8>>.

8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 9. Possible 3-stars: [4]. Unique 3-stars: <<7, 1, 2>, <7, 1, 8>, <7, 1, 9>, <7, 2, 8>>.

9. Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. Possible 3-stars: [15]. Unique 3-stars: <<8, 0, 4>, <8, 0, 5>, <8, 0, 6>, <8, 0, 7>, <8, 0, 9>, <8, 4, 5>, <8, 4, 6>, <8, 4, 7>, <8, 4, 9>, <8, 5, 6>, <8, 5, 7>, <8, 5, 9>, <8, 6, 7>, <8, 6, 9>, <8, 7, 9>>.

10. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 8. Possible 3-stars: [1]. Unique 3-stars: <<9, 5, 7>>.

Combining all the unique 3-stars listed above, we find a total of 50 different 3-stars in the graph. Hence, the final answer is [50].
