Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the edge list provided, we can represent the connections in a more organized form:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, and 9.
Node 3 is connected to node 2.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9.
Node 8 is connected to node 1.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.

Now, we need to find the 3-stars in this graph.

Checking each node for the number of neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 17.

Therefore, the final answer is [17] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (7, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (4, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>.
