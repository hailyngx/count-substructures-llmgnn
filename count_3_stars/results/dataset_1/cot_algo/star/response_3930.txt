Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: [1, 2]
- Node 1: [0, 2, 3]
- Node 2: [0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7]
- Node 3: [1, 7, 8, 9]
- Node 4: [2, 6, 9]
- Node 5: [2, 8]
- Node 6: [2, 4]
- Node 7: [2, 3]
- Node 8: [3, 5]
- Node 9: [3, 4]

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing them up, we have a total of [24] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 2, 4)>
- <2, (0, 2, 5)>
- <2, (0, 2, 6)>
- <2, (0, 2, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
