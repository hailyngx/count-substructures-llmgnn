Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 0, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0, 8, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 7

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 4)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 4)>
<9, (2, 7, 4)>
