Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars by checking nodes with 3 or more neighbors and applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>.
