Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3
- Node 9: 1, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 6 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.
- Node 5 and Node 8 have more than 3 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) and \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars, respectively.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9, so we have [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <3, (1, 0, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
