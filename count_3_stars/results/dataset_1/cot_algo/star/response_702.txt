Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 9: 3

Nodes 0, 5, and 7 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars each. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 12.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 2)>
<5, (4, 0, 7)>
<5, (7, 0, 2)>
<7, (0, 5, 2)>
<7, (6, 5, 0)>
<7, (8, 0, 5)> 

So, the final answer is [12].
