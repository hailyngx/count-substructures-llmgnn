Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, 8. <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 4, 9. <6, (0, 4, 9)>

There is a total of [2] 3-stars in this graph.
