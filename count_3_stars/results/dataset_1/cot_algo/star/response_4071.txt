Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves {5, 7, 9}: <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves {2, 3, 9}: <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 2, 4}: <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves {1, 3, 5}: <9, (1, 3, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
