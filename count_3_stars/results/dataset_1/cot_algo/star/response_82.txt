Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {4}
- Node 2: neighbors {5}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {0}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 6: neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 6, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors {5, 9}, so it forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: has 2 neighbors {7, 9}, so it forms 1 3-star
- Node 7: has 2 neighbors {6, 9}, so it forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors {3, 6, 7}, so it forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: has 2 neighbors {2, 3}, so it forms 1 3-star

Therefore, there are 5 3-stars in total, which can be represented as:
[5]

And the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (5, 9)>
<6, (7, 9)>
<7, (6, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 3)>
