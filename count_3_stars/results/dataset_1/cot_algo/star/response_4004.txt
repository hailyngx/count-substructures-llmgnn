Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 7 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 1, Node 2, and Node 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, we have a total of 1 + 4 = 5 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
