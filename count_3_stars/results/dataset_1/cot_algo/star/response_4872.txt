Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: (3)
- Node 1: (3, 9)
- Node 2: (5)
- Node 3: (0, 1, 6)
- Node 4: (8)
- Node 5: (2)
- Node 6: (3, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (4, 6)
- Node 9: (1, 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars: [3]

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 9)>
<(3, 1, 6)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
