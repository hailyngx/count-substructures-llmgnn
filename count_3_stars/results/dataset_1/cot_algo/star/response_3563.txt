Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 6
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 2: No 3-stars, as it only has 2 neighbors
- Node 3: No 3-stars, as it only has 1 neighbor
- Node 4: No 3-stars, as it only has 1 neighbor
- Node 5: No 3-stars, as it only has 2 neighbors
- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star <8, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>
