Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 5
Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 0, 1
Node 3: 1, 6, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 9
Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 9
Node 7: 1, 6
Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
