Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 9
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9: It has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20] = 30. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 8, 2)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 8, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 0)>
<9, (3, 2, 6)>
