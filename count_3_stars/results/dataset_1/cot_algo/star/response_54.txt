Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5
- Node 3: 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 3

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 27

Therefore, the final answer is [27] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>
