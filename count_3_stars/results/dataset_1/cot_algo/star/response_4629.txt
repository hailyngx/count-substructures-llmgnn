Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4 neighbors: 0, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 2
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 8 neighbors: 2, 4

Next, we'll count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 0, 8)>
- Node 4: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 5: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 7: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 8: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 = 12
So, the final answer is [12]. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 0, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>
