Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, and <3, (4, 5, 9)>.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 9, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, and <5, (3, 7, 9)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].
