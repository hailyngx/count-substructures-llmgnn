Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6, and they are:
<[3, (4, 5, 9)],[4, (2, 3, 7)],[5, (3, 7, 9)],[7, (4, 5, 8)],[8, (0, 1, 7)],[9, (3, 5, 6)]>.
