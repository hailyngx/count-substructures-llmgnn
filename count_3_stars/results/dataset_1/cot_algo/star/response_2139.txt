Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 6}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms five 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms three 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 5 + 3 + 1] = [10].
