Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 2, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 and Node 8 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 3 and Node 6 have 4 neighbors each.

For nodes with four neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the 3-stars from these nodes: 
\[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16] \]

List of unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
