Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: YES (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 1: NO (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: YES (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: YES (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 4: YES (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 5: YES (has 5 neighbors)
- Node 6: NO (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: NO (has only 1 neighbor)
- Node 8: YES (has 5 neighbors)
- Node 9: NO (has only 2 neighbors)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 30

So, there are a total of 30 3-stars in this graph.
Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>
