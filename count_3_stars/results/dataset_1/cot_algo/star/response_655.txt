Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Nodes 5, 8: No Neighbors
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 4}

Now, we can identify any 3-stars that can be formed in this graph:

- Node 0: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Total: 1
    - <0, (2, 7, 9)>

- Node 2: Has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Total: 10
    - <2, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <2, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <2, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 4)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 9)>

- Node 4: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Total: 1
    - <4, (2, 6, 9)>

- Node 6: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Total: 1
    - <6, (1, 2, 4)>

- Node 7: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Total: 1
    - <7, (0, 1, 3)>

- Node 9: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Total: 1
    - <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [15].
