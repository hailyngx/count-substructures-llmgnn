Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in an adjacency list format:

Node 0: 6  
Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7  
Node 2: 1, 9  
Node 3: 5  
Node 4: 1  
Node 5: 3  
Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 8  
Node 7: 1, 6  
Node 8: 6  
Node 9: 2  

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 7 <1, (2, 4, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, 7 <1, (2, 6, 7)>

There are a total of 2 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [2].
