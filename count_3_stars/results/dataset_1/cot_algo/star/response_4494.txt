Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (7, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
