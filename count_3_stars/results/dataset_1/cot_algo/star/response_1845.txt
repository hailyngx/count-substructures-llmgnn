Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each node is a part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 9)>
