Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Now, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 13

Therefore, the final result is: [13]
The unique 3-stars are: <<1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)> >.
