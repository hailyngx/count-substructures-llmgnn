Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 1, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 1, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 29 3-stars formed in the graph: [29]
The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <6, (2, 3, 0)>
- <6, (3, 4, 0)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5, 0)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <6, (5, 0, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
