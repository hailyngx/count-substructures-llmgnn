Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 9}
- Node 3: {7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 6}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 = 11

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [11], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
