Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {4, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 5, and Node 8 have 4 neighbors.

For the 3-star formation:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 4 + 4] = [12] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
