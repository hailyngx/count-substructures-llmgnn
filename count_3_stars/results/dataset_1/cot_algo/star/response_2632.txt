Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 2, 9
- Node 4: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 3

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10, which we represent as [10].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>.
