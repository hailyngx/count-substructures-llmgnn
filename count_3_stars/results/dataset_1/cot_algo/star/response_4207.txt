Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the final result is [33] and the unique 3-stars are:
<4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>
