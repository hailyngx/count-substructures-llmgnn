Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 7}

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 5, 9)>.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 10 = 24].

Therefore, the final result is [24]. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>.
