Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 6: neighbors {0}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 8: neighbors {4}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 4}

Now, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors -> \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors -> \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10 + 10 = 20, which we will represent as [20].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
