Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 6
Node 1: 4, 6
Node 2: 5, 7, 9
Node 3: 0
Node 4: 1, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 8
Node 7: 2, 9
Node 8: 4, 6
Node 9: 2, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2
- Node 4
- Node 9

Now, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (only 1 3-star)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (only 1 3-star)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final result is [6] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
