Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 1 and Node 2 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form a 3-star.
Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 each have 5 neighbors, so they can each form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2+5 = 7], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (8, 9, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
