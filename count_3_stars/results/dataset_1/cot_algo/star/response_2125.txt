Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {4, 6}

Now let's identify the 3-stars by checking nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 5, 8}
- Node 4 forms 3 3-stars with its neighbors:
    - <4, (1, 2, 6)>
    - <4, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 7, 9}

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, and <6, (4, 7, 9)>.
