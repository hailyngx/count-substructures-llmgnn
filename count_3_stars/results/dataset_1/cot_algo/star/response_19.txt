Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 4, 7)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 2, 4)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 7)>.
