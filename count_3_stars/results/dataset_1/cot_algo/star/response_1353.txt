Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5}
- Node 8: {4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 6}

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 35 + 4 = 49, which we will represent as [49].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>

These are the 3-stars formed in the given graph.
