Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 2 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 6 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 5, 8 (2 neighbors)
- Node 4: 2, 7, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 3, 6 (2 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 4, 8, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7 (3 neighbors)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 6: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, 8: <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, 9: <4, (7, 8, 9)>

Hence, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph, which are <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, and <4, (7, 8, 9)>.
