Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 38 edges, we will first find the neighbor set for each node to identify potential 3-stars.

Node 0 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {3, 4, 6, 9}
Node 2 neighbors: {0, 4, 7}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 7, 9}
Node 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
Node 5 neighbors: {3, 4, 8, 9}
Node 6 neighbors: {1, 7}
Node 7 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 6}
Node 8 neighbors: {4, 5}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-star formations:

Node 0: 0, (2, 3, 4) [1 3-star]
Node 3: 3, (0, 1, 5), (0, 4, 9), (1, 4, 5), (4, 5, 9) [4 3-stars]
Node 4: 4, (0, 1, 5), (0, 3, 9), (1, 3, 5), (3, 5, 9) [4 3-stars]
Node 5: 5, (3, 4, 9) [1 3-star]
Node 9: 9, (0, 3, 4), (1, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5) [3 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 3] = 13.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
