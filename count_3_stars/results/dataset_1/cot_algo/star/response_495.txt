Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0: Does not form any 3-stars since it does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Does not form any 3-stars since it does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star with nodes (0, 1, 8).
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-stars since it does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Does not form any 3-stars since it does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: Does not form any 3-stars since it does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star with nodes (1, 3, 9).
- Node 9: Does not form any 3-stars since it does not have 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2. 
Summarizing:
[2]
<3, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>
