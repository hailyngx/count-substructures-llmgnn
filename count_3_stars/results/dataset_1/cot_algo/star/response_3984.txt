Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2
- Node 1: Neighbors are 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0
- Node 3: Neighbors are 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 4, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 3, 6

Now, we will apply the combinatorial calculation to find 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
  - <4, (3, 6, 7)>
  - <4, (3, 6, 8)>
  - <4, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 1] = 6. 
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>.
