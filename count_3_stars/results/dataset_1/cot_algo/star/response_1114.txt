Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node in the graph:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 5, 7
- Node 3: Neighbor is 0
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 7, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 5, 6, 7

Now, let's check the nodes that have three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7, so we put [7].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
