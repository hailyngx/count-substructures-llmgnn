Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
For this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
  - <1, (2, 4, 5)>
  - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <1, (2, 5, 6)>
  - <1, (4, 5, 6)>

- Node 3: \[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \] 3-stars
  - <3, (0, 2, 4)>
  - <3, (0, 2, 5)>
  - <3, (0, 2, 6)>
  - <3, (0, 4, 5)>
  - <3, (0, 4, 6)>
  - <3, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <3, (2, 4, 5)>
  - <3, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <3, (2, 5, 6)>
  - <3, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <3, (0, 2, 7)>
  - <3, (0, 4, 7)>
  - <3, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <3, (0, 5, 7)>
  - <3, (2, 5, 7)>
  - <3, (4, 5, 7)>
  - <3, (0, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (5, 6, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of 24 3-stars in the graph, which can be written as \[24\].
