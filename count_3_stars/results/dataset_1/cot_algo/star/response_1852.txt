Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 4
Node 1: 3, 5, 6
Node 2: 6, 7, 8
Node 3: 1, 8, 9
Node 4: 0
Node 5: 1, 6, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 5
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 2, 3, 9
Node 9: 3, 5, 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 1, 8>
<5, 1, 6>
<6, 2, 5>
<8, 2, 9>
<9, 3, 5>
