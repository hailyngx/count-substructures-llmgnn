Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (3, 7, 5)>, <1, (5, 7, 3)>, <1, (7, 5, 3)>, <2, (0, 6, 3)>, <6, (8, 7, 2)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, and <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
