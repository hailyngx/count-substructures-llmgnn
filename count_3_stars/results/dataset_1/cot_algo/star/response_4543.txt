Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 = 14, so we put this inside brackets: [14].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>

These 3-stars are listed inside <> each only once.
