Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: 0

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, 4 3-star can be formed.
- Node 5, 3 3-star can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
The unique 3-stars are <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>.
