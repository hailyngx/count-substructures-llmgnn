Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first list out the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {6, 7, 9}
Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 2: {4, 5}
Node 3: {4, 7}
Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 7}
Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 7}
Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Node 8: {1, 4, 7, 9}
Node 9: {0, 1, 8}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 20 = 50

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 1, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 8)>
<7, (6, 1, 4)> 

So, the final answer is: [50]
