Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Considering the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed based on the description provided. 

First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 1

Now we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 forms 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2 forms 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3 forms 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 8 forms 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9 forms 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
