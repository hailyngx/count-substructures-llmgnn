Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in an adjacency list format for easier reference:

0: [1, 6, 8, 9]
1: [0, 6, 7, 8]
2: [4]
3: [4, 5, 7]
4: [2, 3, 8]
5: [3, 8]
6: [0, 1, 7]
7: [1, 3, 6]
8: [0, 1, 4, 5]
9: [0]

Now, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

0: [1, 6, 8]
1: [0, 6, 7, 8]
2: [4]
3: [4, 5, 7]
4: [2, 3, 8]
5: [3, 8]
6: [0, 1, 7]
7: [1, 3, 6]
8: [0, 1, 4, 5]
9: [0]

Next, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[
\binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 = 5
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
