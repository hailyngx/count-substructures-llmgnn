Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 (6 neighbors)
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1, 3 (2 neighbors)
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 (5 neighbors)

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the final result is [62] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
