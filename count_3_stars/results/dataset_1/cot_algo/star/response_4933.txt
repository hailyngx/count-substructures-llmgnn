Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5: <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 7: <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 9: <7, (5, 6, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
