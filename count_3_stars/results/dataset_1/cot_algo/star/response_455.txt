Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4
- Node 6: 0, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star configurations:
- Node 0, 4, and 5 have 5 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-star configurations.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 35 + 4 + 1 = 40, which we will represent as [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
