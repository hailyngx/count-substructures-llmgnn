Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 7 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 = 14 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
