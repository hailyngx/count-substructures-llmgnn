Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9.
        
Let's first identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 6}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, we will check for each node that has three or more neighbors to see if any 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
  These 3-stars are:
  <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, 
  <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
