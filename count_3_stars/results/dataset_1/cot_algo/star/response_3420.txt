Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges described by the provided edge list, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 2: No neighbors
- Node 3: Neighbors {5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by considering nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (5, 9, 0)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
