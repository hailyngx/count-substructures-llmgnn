Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given a 3-star graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we first need to identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 1)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (Nodes 0, 4, 8, 9)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (Nodes 6, 7)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (Nodes 1, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (Nodes 3, 4, 7)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (Nodes 3, 4, 6)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 4)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (Node 1)

Next, we determine the number of 3-stars possible:

- Node 1 and Node 4 both have 5 neighbors, so they can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars each.
- The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 = 20.

Therefore, the final answer is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (8, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (8, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 4)>
<7, (3, 6, 4)>
