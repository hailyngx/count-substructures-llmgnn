Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, we'll identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
