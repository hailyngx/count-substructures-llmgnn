Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 9}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {0, 1}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 4] = [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>.
