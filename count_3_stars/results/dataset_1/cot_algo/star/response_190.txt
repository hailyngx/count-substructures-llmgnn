Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that each node is connected to are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {6}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 1 does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 3, 7).
- Node 3 does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 4 does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 5 does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 6 does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 5, 8).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 3, 7), (1, 5, 8)>.
