Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are as described. Let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {5, 8}
Node 1: Neighbors {3, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 8}
Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2}
Node 4: Neighbor {8}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 7}
Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9}
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4}
Node 9: Neighbors {1, 6}

Now, we will check for each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [17] \)

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
