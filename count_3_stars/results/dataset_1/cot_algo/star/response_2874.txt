Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 6)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 7 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars. However, we have to be careful because some of these 3-stars will be duplicates of those found in other nodes. After eliminating duplicates, we find the following unique 3-stars from node 9: <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.

Finally, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 35 = 45

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 45, which we represent as [45].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 6)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
