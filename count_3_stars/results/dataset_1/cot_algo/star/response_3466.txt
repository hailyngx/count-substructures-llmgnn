Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graph can be visualized as follows:

```
        1
        |
0--3--1--8
|  |     |
4  9     0
|        |
6--------4
|
2--7
|
5
```

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [31].

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 0, 4)>, <3, (1, 0, 8)>
