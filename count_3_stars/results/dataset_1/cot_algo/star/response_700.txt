Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
[5]

From node 0: <0, (4, 5, 7)>
From node 4: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
From node 5: <5, (0, 1, 9)>
From node 6: <6, (4, 9, 6)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
