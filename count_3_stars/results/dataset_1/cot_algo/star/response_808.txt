Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 3, 8
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4 has neighbors: 2
- Node 5 has neighbors: 7, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 5
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 5

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1] = 17.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>.
