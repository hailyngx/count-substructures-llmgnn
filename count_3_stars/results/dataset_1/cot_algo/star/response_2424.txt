Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 4, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms four 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 6, which is represented as [6].
