Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 6
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 6 form a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 3: <0, (2, 7, 3)>
- Node 1 and Node 5 form a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 9: <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 and Node 9 form a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 5: <3, (4, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
