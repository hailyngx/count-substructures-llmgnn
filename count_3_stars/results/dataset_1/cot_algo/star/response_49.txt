Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 possible 3-star with node 2 as the center.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 possible 3-star with node 4 as the center.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 possible 3-star with node 7 as the center.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 = 3].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
