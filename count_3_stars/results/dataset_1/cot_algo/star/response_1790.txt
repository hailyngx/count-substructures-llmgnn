Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbor {7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, 9: <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, 9: <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, 9: <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 forms 4 3-stars:
  - <5, (0, 1, 2)>
  - <5, (1, 3, 6)>
  - <5, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, 8: <7, (5, 6, 8)>
  
Summarizing the results:
Total number of 3-stars: [7]
Unique 3-stars found: <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>
