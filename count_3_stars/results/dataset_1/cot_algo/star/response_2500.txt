Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0, 3

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10 + 1 = 11, and they are:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
