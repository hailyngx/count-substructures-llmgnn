Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph.

1. **Neighbor Nodes for Each Node**:
   - Node 0: {2, 6, 9}
   - Node 1: {2, 9}
   - Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
   - Node 3: {9}
   - Node 4: {6, 8}
   - Node 5: {6}
   - Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
   - Node 7: {2, 6, 8}
   - Node 8: {2, 4, 6, 7}
   - Node 9: {0, 1, 3}

2. **Calculating the Number of 3-Stars**:
   - Node 0, Node 6, and Node 9 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the possible 3-stars for these nodes.
   - Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
   - Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
   - Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

3. **Total Number of 3-Stars**:
   - Total = 1 + 20 + 1 = 22

Putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets gives us: [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
