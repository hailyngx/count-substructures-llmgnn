Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 9, 0)>
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 4)> and <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (4, 5, 9)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in total, so the final result is [5].
