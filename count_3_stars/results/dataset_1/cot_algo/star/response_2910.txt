Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Now, let's check for each node how many 3-stars it is part of:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 6. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 6. <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms 4 3-stars:
    - With nodes 0, 5, 7. <4, (0, 5, 7)>
    - With nodes 1, 5, 6. <4, (1, 5, 6)>
    - With nodes 8, 5, 9. <4, (8, 5, 9)>
    - With nodes 0, 1, 7. <4, (0, 1, 7)>

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (8, 5, 9)>, and <4, (0, 1, 7)>.
