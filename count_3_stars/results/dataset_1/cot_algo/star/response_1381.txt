Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 9}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4}

Next, we look at the nodes that have three or more neighbors, since only these nodes can be part of a 3-star:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in this graph, and they are:

<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
