Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 8, 9
Node 1: 6, 7
Node 2: 6
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 5, 6, 7
Node 5: 3, 4
Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 9
Node 7: 1, 4, 9
Node 8: 0
Node 9: 0, 6, 7

Next, let's identify the 3-star structures:

Node 0: 2 neighbors - no 3-star
Node 1: 2 neighbors - no 3-star
Node 2: 1 neighbor - no 3-star
Node 3: 1 neighbor - no 3-star
Node 4: 3 neighbors - 1 3-star <4, (5, 6, 7)>
Node 5: 2 neighbors - no 3-star
Node 6: 4 neighbors - 4 3-stars <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
Node 7: 3 neighbors - 1 3-star <7, (1, 4, 9)>
Node 8: 1 neighbor - no 3-star
Node 9: 3 neighbors - 1 3-star <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 7, and they are:

<4, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)> 

Hence, the final answer is [7].
