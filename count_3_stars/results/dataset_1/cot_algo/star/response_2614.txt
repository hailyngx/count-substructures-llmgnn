Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 3}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 4}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9, and we can list them as follows:
[<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>]
