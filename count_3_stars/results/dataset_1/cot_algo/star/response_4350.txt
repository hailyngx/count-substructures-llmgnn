Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (7, 8, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (5, 3, 4)>, <2, (5, 4, 2)>, <2, (5, 4, 3)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 4)>, <3, (5, 2, 4)>, <3, (5, 4, 2)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 2, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 4)>, <4, (6, 5, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 1, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 1, 7)>, <5, (4, 1, 8)>, <5, (4, 2, 7)>, <5, (4, 2, 8)>
