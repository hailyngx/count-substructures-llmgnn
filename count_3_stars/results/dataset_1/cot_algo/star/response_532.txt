Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 1: {3, 8}  
Node 2: {3, 4, 5}  
Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 6}  
Node 4: {2, 6, 9}  
Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 7}  
Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 7}  
Node 7: {5, 6}  
Node 8: {1}  
Node 9: {4}  

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: None (2 neighbors)  
Node 2: 1 3-star  
Node 3: 1 3-star  
Node 4: None (2 neighbors)  
Node 5: 1 3-star  
Node 6: None (2 neighbors)  
Node 7: None (2 neighbors)  

The total number of 3-stars is 3 (1 from each of nodes 2, 3, and 5).
So, the final result is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (3, 5, 6)> <3, (1, 2, 5)> <5, (2, 3, 6)>.
