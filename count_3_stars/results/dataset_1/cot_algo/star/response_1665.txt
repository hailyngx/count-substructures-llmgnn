Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 7, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 7
- Node 4 has neighbors: 8
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 7
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 6)>
Node 2 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 3 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 4 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 5 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 6 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (5, 6, 8)>
Node 8 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 8)>

In total, there are 3 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [3].
