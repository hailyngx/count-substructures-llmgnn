Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<1, (2, 4, 5)>

For Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>

For Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>

There are a total of [1 + 4 + 10] = 15 3-stars in the graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
