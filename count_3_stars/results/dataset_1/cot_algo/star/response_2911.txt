Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented by the following adjacency list:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3}
- Node 7: {1, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 8}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
    - There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 8
    - There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
    - There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [10 + 4 + 10] = [24].
