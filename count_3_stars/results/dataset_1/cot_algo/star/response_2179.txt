Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 6}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 6}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 6, 7} and nodes {1, 6, 8}. (2 3-stars)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 7, 9}. (1 3-star)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {8, 9, 0} and nodes {9, 0, 8}. (2 3-stars)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 0, 8}. (1 3-star)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes {9, 0, 3}. (1 3-star)

There are total 7 unique 3-stars formed in this graph, which can be listed as follows:
<[1, 6, 7], [1, 6, 8], [4, 2, 7], [0, 3, 8], [0, 8, 9], [6, 1, 8], [8, 9, 0]>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
