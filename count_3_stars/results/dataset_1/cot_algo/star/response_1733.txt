Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1]
- Node 1: [\( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10]
- Node 3: [\( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10]
- Node 6: [\( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10]
- Node 9: [\( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20]

Adding these up, we find the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 51]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 51. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (7, 6, 9)>
- <1, (8, 6, 9)>
- <3, (5, 0, 1)>
- <3, (6, 4, 9)>
- <6, (7, 1, 9)>
- <9, (1, 7, 6)>
- <9, (1, 8, 6)>
- <9, (3, 0, 2)>
- <9, (3, 6, 4)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
- <9, (7, 1, 6)>
- <9, (7, 1, 8)>
- <9, (8, 1, 6)>
- <9, (8, 1, 7)>
