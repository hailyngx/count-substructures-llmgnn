Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 5
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9) -> 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 6, 7) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
