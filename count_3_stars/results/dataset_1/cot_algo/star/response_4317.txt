Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 1, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 22.

Therefore, the final count inside brackets is [22], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 5, 8)>
<3, (6, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 0)>
<9, (4, 8, 0)>
<9, (4, 8, 2)>
<9, (8, 0, 2)>
<9, (8, 2, 4)>
