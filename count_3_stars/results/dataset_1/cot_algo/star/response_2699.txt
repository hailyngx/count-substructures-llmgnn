Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 3: 2, 7
Node 4: 7
Node 5: 0, 2, 6
Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 9: 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as we need at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 0 = 49

Therefore, the final answer is [49] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
