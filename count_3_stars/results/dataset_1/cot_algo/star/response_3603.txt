Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 17, which we will represent as [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (7, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 9, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 4)>
