Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2 neighbors: 1, 6, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 5 neighbors: 4
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 3
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 8

Now, let's identify how many 3-stars each node could be a part of:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \([4 + 35 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4] = \mathbf{59}\)
