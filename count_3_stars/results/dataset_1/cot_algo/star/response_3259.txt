Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5, 8
Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 6
Node 3: 6, 8
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 0, 1
Node 6: 1, 2, 3
Node 7: 1, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 3, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 4, 7, 8

Next, we need to identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars.

Node 1, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
