Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 6, 9
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 9.

For each of these nodes, we will apply the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula to calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the graph are: <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>.

Putting this final count inside brackets, we have a total of [6].
