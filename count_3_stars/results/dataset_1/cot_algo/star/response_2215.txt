Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 0, 3

Next, we will check for nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 3 and Node 4 both have 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star for each of these nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
