Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

0: [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]
1: [0]
2: [0, 3, 4]
3: [2, 7, 8]
4: [0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9]
5: [4]
6: [0, 4, 7, 9]
7: [3, 4, 6, 9]
8: [0, 3]
9: [4, 6, 7]

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the final answer is [41] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<(2, 3, 7)>, <(4, 6, 7)>
