Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [19] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (9, 7, 1)>, <5, (9, 7, 4)>, <5, (9, 7, 1)>, <5, (9, 7, 4)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>
