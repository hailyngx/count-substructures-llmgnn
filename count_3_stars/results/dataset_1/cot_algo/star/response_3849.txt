Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find all the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3
- Node 9: 3, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 26, which we represent as [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 4)>
- <0, (5, 2, 8)>
- <0, (5, 2, 6)>
- <0, (5, 8, 6)>
- <0, (8, 2, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 6, 4)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (5, 0, 8)>
- <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 0, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- <8, (2, 0, 3)>
