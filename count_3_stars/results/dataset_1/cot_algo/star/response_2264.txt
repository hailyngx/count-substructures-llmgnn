Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: (4, 5, 9)
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars: (0, 3, 7) and (2, 3, 5)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: (2, 4, 7)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, and <9, (2, 4, 7)>.
