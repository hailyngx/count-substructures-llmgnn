Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the final result is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
