Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Does not form 3-stars (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: Does not form 3-stars (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: Does not form 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: Does not form 3-stars (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star (with nodes 1, 7, 9)
- Node 5: Does not form 3-stars (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: Does not form 3-stars (has 1 neighbor)
- Node 7: Does not form 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: Does not form 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star (with nodes 2, 4, 5)

The total number of 3-stars is [2]. They are:
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 4, 5>
