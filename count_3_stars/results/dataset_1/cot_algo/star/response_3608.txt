Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 8}

Nodes 0, 1, and 4 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [3 \times 4] = 12 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
