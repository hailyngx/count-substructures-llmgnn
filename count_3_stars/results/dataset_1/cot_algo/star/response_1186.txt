Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 1}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 4 = 14 \), so the final answer is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
