Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 0
Node 3: 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 7
Node 5: 6, 9
Node 6: 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 6, 7
Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's check for each node with three or more neighbors to see if they can form any 3-stars:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 25

Therefore, the final answer is [25] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
