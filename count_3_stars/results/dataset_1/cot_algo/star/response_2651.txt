Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 5} <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 7} <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 9} <8, (2, 3, 9)>

As there are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
