Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 7  
Node 1: 0, 2  
Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6  
Node 3: 4  
Node 4: 3, 9  
Node 5: 2  
Node 6: 2, 7, 8, 9  
Node 7: 0, 6, 8  
Node 8: 6, 7  
Node 9: 4, 6  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 2, 7)>  
<2, (0, 1, 5)>  
<2, (0, 1, 6)>  
<2, (1, 5, 6)>  
<2, (5, 6, 7)>  
<6, (2, 7, 8)>  
<6, (7, 8, 9)>  
<7, (0, 6, 8)>  
<7, (6, 8, 9)>  
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
