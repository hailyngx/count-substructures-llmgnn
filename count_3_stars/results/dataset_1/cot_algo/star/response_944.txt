Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 3, 9
- Node 1: neighbors are 4, 6
- Node 2: neighbors are 3, 5
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 2
- Node 4: neighbors are 1, 5
- Node 5: neighbors are 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 7
- Node 7: neighbor is 6
- Node 9: neighbors are 0, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 0, 1, 2, and 9 each have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Thus, in total, there is [1] 3-star. 

The unique 3-star found is <5, (2, 4, 9)>.
