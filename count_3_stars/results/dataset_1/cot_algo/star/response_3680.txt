Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 7

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
  <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>,
  <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars:
  <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>,
  <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 5)>, <3, (4, 8, 5)>, <3, (7, 8, 5)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars:
  <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars:
  <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>,
  <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 2)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars:
  <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars:
  <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 43, and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>,
<2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>,
<3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>,
<3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 5)>, <3, (4, 8, 5)>, <3, (7, 8, 5)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, 
<5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>,
<5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 2)>, 
<7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)> 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [43].
