Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {0, 3}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

Next, we will search for nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 (4 3-stars formed)
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 (4 3-stars formed)
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 (10 3-stars formed)
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 (10 3-stars formed)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
