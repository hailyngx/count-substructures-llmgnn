Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 0, 7

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars formed: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 16 \)

Therefore, the final result is [16] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>
