Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 5: <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, 7: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 4, 8: <5, (2, 4, 8)>

In this case, there are 3 unique 3-stars formed in the graph. Hence, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [3].
