Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 4, 9
Node 1: 2, 8
Node 2: 1, 8
Node 4: 0, 6
Node 5: 6
Node 6: 4, 5
Node 8: 1, 2
Node 9: 0

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:
Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0

Since none of the nodes have 3 or more neighbors, there are no 3-stars in this graph. Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [0].
