Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 7}
Node 1: {2, 3}
Node 2: {1, 3, 5}
Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
Node 4: {5, 6}
Node 5: {2, 3, 4}
Node 6: {4, 7, 9}
Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 9}
Node 9: {6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17, which we will put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>
