Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central node and their neighbors are:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}

Now, let's check for the presence of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12] with the unique 3-stars being <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>.
