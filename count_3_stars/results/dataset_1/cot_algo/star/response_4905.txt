Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So the total number of 3-stars is 16.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 5, 8)>
<0, (6, 5, 9)>
<0, (8, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 0, 8)>
<5, (6, 0, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 0)>
<5, (7, 1, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 1)>
<5, (8, 0, 6)>
<5, (8, 1, 7)>
