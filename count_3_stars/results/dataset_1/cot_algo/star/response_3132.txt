Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 2, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 8}

Now, let's check for each node that has three or more neighbors to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 - forms 10 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 - forms 10 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 - forms 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 - forms 4 3-stars

There are a total of 34 3-stars in this graph: [10 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [34]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
