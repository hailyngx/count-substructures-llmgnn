Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <3, (4, 7)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 7
Therefore, the final answer is [7]. The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (4, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>.
