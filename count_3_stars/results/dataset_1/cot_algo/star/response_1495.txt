Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 has \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25, which we will represent as [25].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 9>

So the final answer is [25], <1, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 9>.
