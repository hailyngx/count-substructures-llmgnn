Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 8: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars [1 + 1 + 4] = 6

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (4, 8, 9)>
