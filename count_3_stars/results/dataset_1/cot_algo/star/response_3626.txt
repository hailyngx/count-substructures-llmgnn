Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7), forms 1 3-star. Total = 1
- Node 2: Has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 7), forms 1 3-star. Total = 1
- Node 4: Has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6), forms 1 3-star. Total = 1
- Node 5: Has 5 neighbors (> 3), forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Total = 10
- Node 6: Has 4 neighbors (> 3), forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Total = 4
- Node 7: Has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 9), forms 1 3-star. Total = 1
- Node 8: Has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 9), forms 1 3-star. Total = 1
- Node 9: Has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8), forms 1 3-star. Total = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 20
Therefore, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
