Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6}

Now, for each node that has three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that node is involved in. We have:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 9) = 14 
Therefore, the final answer is [14].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (2, 9, 6)>
- <6, (5, 6, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 6, 1)>
- <9, (2, 6, 4)>
- <9, (4, 6, 9)>
