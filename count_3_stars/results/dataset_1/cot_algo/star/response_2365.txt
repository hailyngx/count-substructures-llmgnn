Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 1: {7, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 7}

Now we need to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>
