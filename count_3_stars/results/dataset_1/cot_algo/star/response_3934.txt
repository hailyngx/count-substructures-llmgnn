Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 7
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 3: 1, 7
Node 4: 1, 6
Node 5: 9
Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 3, 6
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 5, 6

Next, let's identify the 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
These 3-stars are: <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>

Node 6 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
These 3-stars are: <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 4 = 14, which we represent as [14].
