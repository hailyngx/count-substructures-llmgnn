Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format for easier visualization:
Node 0: {1, 2, 9}
Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: {0, 5, 7}
Node 4: {5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 5: {2, 4}
Node 6: {1}
Node 7: {1, 2, 4}
Node 8: {1, 4}
Node 9: {0, 1, 4}

Now, for each node, we'll calculate its neighbor set:
Node 0: {1, 2, 9}
Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: {0, 5, 7}
Node 4: {5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 5: {2, 4}
Node 6: {1}
Node 7: {1, 2, 4}
Node 8: {1, 4}
Node 9: {0, 1, 4}

Next, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
Node 1: <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
Node 4: <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>
