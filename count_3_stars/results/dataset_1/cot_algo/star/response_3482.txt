Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2 and 6.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 4: Neighbor is 3.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2 and 5.
- Node 9: Neighbor is 5.

Now, let's check which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 5, and 7 each have 3 neighbors and can form 3-stars.
- Node 2 and 6 have 4 neighbors, making them eligible to form 3-stars.

For nodes 1, 5, and 7, since they have exactly 3 neighbors, each of them can form only one 3-star.
Hence, we have 3 3-stars so far.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars that can be formed using nodes 2 and 6, which have 4 neighbors.
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

So, we can form 4 additional 3-stars using nodes 2 and 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3+4] = 7.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 2, 6)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (7, 8, 0)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
