Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graph can be analyzed based on the given information of the graph.

Calculating the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 8
- Node 9: degree 2

Identifying the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{7}{3} = 35

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 35] = [37]

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
