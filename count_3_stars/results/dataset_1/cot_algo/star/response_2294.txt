Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 6
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 1: Does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 2: Does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 4: Does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 7: Does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 8: Does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 9: Does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 1, 2)> and <6, (1, 3, 7)>.
