Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 have 5, 5, 6, 5, 6 neighbors respectively, which is 21 total 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 0, 1)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
