Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 14 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>
