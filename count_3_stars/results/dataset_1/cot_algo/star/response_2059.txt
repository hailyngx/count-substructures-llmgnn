Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor of nodes 8
- Node 1: Neighbors of nodes 3, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors of nodes 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: Neighbors of nodes 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: Neighbors of nodes 2, 9
- Node 5: Neighbor of node 2
- Node 6: Neighbor of node 3
- Node 8: Neighbors of nodes 0, 1, 3
- Node 9: Neighbor of node 4

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, so we have:

\[ [4] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:

\[ <3, (1, 2, 8)> \]
