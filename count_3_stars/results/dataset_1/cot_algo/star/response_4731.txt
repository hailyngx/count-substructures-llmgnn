Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
From the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 1, 4, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes.

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<1, (5, 6, 7)>

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (5, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 10] = [21]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (5, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
