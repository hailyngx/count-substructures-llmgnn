Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edge connections:

- Node 0 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 4, 7, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 8
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 3 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 5 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 6 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 7 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 9 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [33].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (7, 9, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 7, 9)>
- <7, (4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (7, 9, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 7)>
- <9, (0, 3, 9)>
- <9, (0, 7, 9)>

- <9, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (7, 9, 9)>
