Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {2, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>.
