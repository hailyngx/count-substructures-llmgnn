Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 5, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 and Node 4 have 3 neighbors each.
- Node 8 also has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

So, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
