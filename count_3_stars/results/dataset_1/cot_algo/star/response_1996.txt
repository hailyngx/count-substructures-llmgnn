Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. There are no other nodes with exactly 3 neighbors connected to 0.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. There are no other nodes with exactly 3 neighbors connected to 3.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 33 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
