Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes 1, 2, 6, and 7 have 5 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
- Nodes 1, 6, and 7 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars as well.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
