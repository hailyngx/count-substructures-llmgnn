Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graph in this case is as follows:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 9), (9, 3)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (8, 9), (9, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 7), (7, 0)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (5, 6), (6, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (4, 7), (7, 4)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 4), (4, 2)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (3, 5), (5, 3)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 9), (9, 1)>
- Node 9 forms three 3-stars: <9, (0, 8), (8, 0)>, <9, (0, 1), (1, 0)>, and <9, (1, 8), (8, 1)>

The total number of 3-star graphs in this network is [13].
