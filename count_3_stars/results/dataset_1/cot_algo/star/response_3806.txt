Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 4, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors

Next, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: 1 3-star (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 20] = 46.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)> <6, (0, 7, 8)> <6, (5, 8, 9)> <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)> <7, (4, 6, 8)> <7, (4, 8, 9)> <7, (5, 6, 8)> <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)> <8, (4, 7, 9)> <8, (5, 6, 7)> <8, (5, 7, 9)> <8, (6, 7, 9)>

This concludes the analysis for the given graph.
