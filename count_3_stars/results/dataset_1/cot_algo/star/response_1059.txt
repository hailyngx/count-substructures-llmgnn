Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we'll determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbor {1, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each node can form:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 11 3-stars: [<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 0)>].

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11].
