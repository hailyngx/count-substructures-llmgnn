Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 
\[ 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 26 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 3)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (5, 1, 7)>
<0, (5, 1, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
