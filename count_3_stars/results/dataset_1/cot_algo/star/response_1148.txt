Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 forms 4 3-stars.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 7.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
