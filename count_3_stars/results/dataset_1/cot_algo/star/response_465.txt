Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 42 edges, we first need to find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2}

Now we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
    - <1, (2, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
    
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
    - <2, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <2, (0, 1, 9)>
    - <2, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <2, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <2, (1, 6, 8)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 40, and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>.
