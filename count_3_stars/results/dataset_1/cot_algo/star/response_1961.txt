Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 5 and 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 4, and 6
- Node 2: Neighbor is 6
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 4, and 5
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 3, 5, and 6
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 8 and 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 5, 7, and 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 6, 7, and 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 30
Therefore, the final answer is [30]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
