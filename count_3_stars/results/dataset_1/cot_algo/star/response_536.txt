Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the given graph:

```
   0 --- 5
    \   /  
     1---4
      \ | \
        2  6
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6. So, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.

Summing up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the output is: 
\[ [9] \]
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
