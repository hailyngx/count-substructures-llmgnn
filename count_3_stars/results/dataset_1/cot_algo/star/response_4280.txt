Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 1: neighbor {7}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: neighbor {6}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [13]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
