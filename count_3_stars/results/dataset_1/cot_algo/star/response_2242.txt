Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 5, 6}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 and Node 6 both have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars each.
Node 2 and Node 5 both have 3 neighbors, so they individually cannot form any 3-star.
Node 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2] as there are 8 unique 3-stars:

<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
