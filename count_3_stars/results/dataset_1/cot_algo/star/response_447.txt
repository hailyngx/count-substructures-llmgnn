Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:  
Total number of 3-stars is [4].

Unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (2, 5, 9)>  
<1, (3, 6, 9)>  
<2, (0, 6, 7)>  
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
