Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 4 = 14, which we will represent as [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- <7, (1, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 6, 7)>
- <7, (5, 6, 7)>
