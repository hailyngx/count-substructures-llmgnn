Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a more readable format:

- Node 0: neighbors 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: neighbors 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: neighbors 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: neighbors 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: neighbors 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: neighbors 1, 4, 6
- Node 6: neighbors 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: neighbors 0, 2, 4
- Node 8: neighbors 0, 1, 3
- Node 9: neighbors 2

Next, we'll check each node to see if it forms a 3-star. Since each node only forms one 3-star, we'll count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has only 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14, which we will represent inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>.
