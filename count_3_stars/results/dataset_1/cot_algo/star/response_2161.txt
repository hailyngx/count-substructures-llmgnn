Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 3, 6).
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 5, 7).
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 9).

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [3].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
