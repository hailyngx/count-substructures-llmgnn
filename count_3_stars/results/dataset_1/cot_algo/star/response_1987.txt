Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: Neighbor is 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 7
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 6
- Node 6: Neighbor is 4
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 3, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 3

Now, we'll identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 3, 8)
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 8, 7)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 2, so the final result is [2].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <3, (0, 8, 7)>
