Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: Neighbors are 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, we can identify the 3-star graphs in this network. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can form 3-stars. Let's list them:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (8, 9, 0)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars formed in this graph, so the final answer is [5].
