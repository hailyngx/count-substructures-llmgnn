Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more organized way to clearly see the connections:

Node 0: 3, 7, 8
Node 1: 2, 9
Node 2: 1, 7
Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 5: 3, 4, 9
Node 6: 3, 4, 7
Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6
Node 8: 0, 3
Node 9: 1, 3, 5

Now, let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (5, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
