Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [30] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (4, 8, 5)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
