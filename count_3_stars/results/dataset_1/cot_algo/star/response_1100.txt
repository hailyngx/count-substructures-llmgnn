Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
This 3-star graph has 12 3-stars [12]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>.
