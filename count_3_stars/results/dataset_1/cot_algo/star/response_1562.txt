Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 8}
Node 1: {4}
Node 2: {8}
Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 4: {1, 7, 8, 9}
Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
Node 6: {0, 3, 5}
Node 7: {4, 5, 9}
Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4}
Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 8 each have 4 neighbors.

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32 3-stars, so the final result is [32].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
