Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node in the graph: 

- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 4 = 18, so we have found 18 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [18] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
