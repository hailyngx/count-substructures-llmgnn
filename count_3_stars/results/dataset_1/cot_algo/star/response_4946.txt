Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 3}
- Node 9: {3, 5}

Now, we will look for nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 4, and 5 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [13] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 2, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 1)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (2, 1, 7)>
- <4, (1, 7, 5)>
- <4, (2, 7, 5)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- <5, (7, 3, 9)>
- <5, (3, 9, 5)>
- <5, (7, 9, 3)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
