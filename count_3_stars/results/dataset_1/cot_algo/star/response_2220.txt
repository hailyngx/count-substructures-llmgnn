Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Next, we'll identify 3-stars in the graph by finding nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 9: <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 8: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 9: <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5: <8, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
