Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars and list the unique ones:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with {4, 5, 6}, so it contributes 1 to the total.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with {4, 7, 8}, so it contributes 1 to the total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
