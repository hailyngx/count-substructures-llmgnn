Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {3}
Node 1 neighbors: {5}
Node 2 neighbors: {3, 4, 6}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 2, 7}
Node 4 neighbors: {2, 5}
Node 5 neighbors: {1, 4, 7, 8}
Node 6 neighbors: {2, 8, 9}
Node 7 neighbors: {3, 5}
Node 8 neighbors: {5, 6}
Node 9 neighbors: {6}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 2 and Node 5 both have 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star for each of them.

Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with Node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 2, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
