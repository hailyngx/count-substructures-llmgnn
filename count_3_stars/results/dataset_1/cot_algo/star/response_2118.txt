Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the final answer is [22], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>
