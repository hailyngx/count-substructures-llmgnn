Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 6}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {3, 4}

Now, we will identify the 3-star graphs:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
<3, (0, 7, 9)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
<4, (0, 5, 9)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
<5, (2, 4, 6)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
<6, (2, 5, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 9.
