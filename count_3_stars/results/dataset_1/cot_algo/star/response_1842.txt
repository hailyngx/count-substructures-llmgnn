Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
Node 1: {3, 9}
Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
Node 4: {0}
Node 5: {6}
Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 8}
Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 9}
Node 8: {0, 3, 6}
Node 9: {0, 1, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 26

Thus, we have 26 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>

So, the final answer is [26].
