Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Next, we'll count the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9.

Therefore, the final answer is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 9, 4)>
<8, (0, 9, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
