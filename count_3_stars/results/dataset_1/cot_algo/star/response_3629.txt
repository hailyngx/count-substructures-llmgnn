Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 6, 7
Node 1: 2, 7, 9
Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6
Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7
Node 4: 6, 7, 8
Node 5: 2, 3, 8
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 8: 4, 5
Node 9: 1, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
