Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 5)>
<2, (3, 8, 5)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
