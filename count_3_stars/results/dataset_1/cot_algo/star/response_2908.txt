Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 8, 4)>
<1, (7, 0, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 4)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
