Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4}

Now, let's check for nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 7, 9}. <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 9}. <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 4}. <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, and <9, (0, 2, 4)>.
