Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 9: <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8: <6, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the final result is:
- Total number of 3-stars: [4]
- Unique 3-stars found: <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>
