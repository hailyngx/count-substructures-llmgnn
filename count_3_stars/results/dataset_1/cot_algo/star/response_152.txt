Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Since there is no node with more than 3 neighbors, we have a total of 9 3-stars: [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 3)>.
