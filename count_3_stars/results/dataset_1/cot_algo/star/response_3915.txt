Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 5 has 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 40.

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 5)>
<3, (1, 9, 5)>
<3, (2, 9, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 5)>
<3, (4, 9, 7)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 9, 6)>
<5, (3, 8, 6)>
<5, (3, 1, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (6, 0, 9)>
<5, (6, 3, 9)>
<5, (7, 1, 4)>
<5, (7, 3, 4)>
