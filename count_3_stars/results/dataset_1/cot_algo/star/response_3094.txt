Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4, 5
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (0, 6, 7) -> [1] <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (3, 5, 9) -> [2] <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (2, 3, 9) -> [3] <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (1, 7, 8) -> [4] <9, (1, 7, 8)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final result is [4].
