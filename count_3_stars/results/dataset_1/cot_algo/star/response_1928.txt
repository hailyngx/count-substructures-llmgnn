Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 6
Node 1: 4, 7
Node 3: 8
Node 4: 1, 5, 8
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 3, 4

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, there is a total of 1 3-star in this graph.

The unique 3-star found is: <4, (1, 5, 8)>

So, the final answer is [1].
