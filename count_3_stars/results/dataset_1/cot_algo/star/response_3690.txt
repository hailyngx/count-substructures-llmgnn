Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
Calculating for the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: None (2 neighbors)
- Node 1: None (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: None (2 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1 (3-star formed with neighbors 1, 2, 4) 
- Node 4: 1 (3-star formed with neighbors 0, 3, 8) 
- Node 5: None (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1 (3-star formed with neighbors 1, 2, 8) 
- Node 7: None (1 neighbor)
- Node 8: None (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1 (3-star formed with neighbors 3, 5, 6) 

Total number of 3-stars = 3
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
