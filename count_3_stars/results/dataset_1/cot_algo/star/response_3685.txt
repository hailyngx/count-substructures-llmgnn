Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, 
    - <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 4 also has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
    - <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4] = 14:
<1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>,
<4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>
