Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \(10 + 20 + 4 = 34\), giving us a total of [34] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
