Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 6}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 6}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 6 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7 has inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10 + 1 = 11]. The unique 3-stars are <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 4)>, <6, (0, 7, 5)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>.
