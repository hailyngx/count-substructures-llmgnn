Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, we have a total of 19 unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
