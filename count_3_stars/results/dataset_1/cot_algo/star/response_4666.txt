Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 8}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {2, 6}
- Node 4: {6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {6}

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10] = [17]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>
