Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {7}

Next, we find the number of 3-stars for nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
