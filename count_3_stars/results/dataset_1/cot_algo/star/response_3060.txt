Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 2: neighbor {9}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 8: neighbor {3}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 3, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: as it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3: can form a 3-star.
- Node 4: can form a 3-star.
- Node 7: can form a 3-star.
- Node 9: can form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
