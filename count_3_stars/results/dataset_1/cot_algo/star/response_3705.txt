Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 4, 5, 7
Node 3: 4, 7, 9
Node 4: 1, 3, 6
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 0, 4
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 9
Node 8: 0, 9
Node 9: 0, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>

Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star:
<3, (4, 7, 9)>

Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star:
<4, (1, 3, 6)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
<7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>

Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
<9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 15, so the final answer is [15]. 
The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>
