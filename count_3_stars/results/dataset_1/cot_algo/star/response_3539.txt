Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 8, and 9. These nodes can potentially form 3-stars.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of possible 3-stars they can form:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
