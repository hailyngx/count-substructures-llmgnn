Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3}
Node 1: {2, 3, 9}
Node 2: {0, 1, 5}
Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
Node 4: {6, 9}
Node 5: {2, 8}
Node 6: {3, 4}
Node 7: {3, 9}
Node 8: {5, 9}
Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, we'll find the 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 = 21

So, the final answer is [21] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (6, 4, 9)>.
