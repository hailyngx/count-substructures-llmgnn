Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
