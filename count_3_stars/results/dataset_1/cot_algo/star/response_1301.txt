Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 5}
- Node 4: {3, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 2}
- Node 9: {6}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 6, and Node 2 can form 3-stars as they each have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final result is [6] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 4)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>
