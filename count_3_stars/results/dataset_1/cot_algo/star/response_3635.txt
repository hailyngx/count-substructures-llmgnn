Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {6, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 18

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
