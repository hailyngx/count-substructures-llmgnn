Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 0, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors - forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: 3 neighbors - no 3-star
- Node 7: 4 neighbors - forms additional 1 3-star
- Node 9: 3 neighbors - no 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 2, 7>
- <0, 4, 6, 7>
