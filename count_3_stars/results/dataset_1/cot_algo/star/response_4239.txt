Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8 (Degree: 4)
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 7 (Degree: 4)
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7, 9 (Degree: 4)
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 8 (Degree: 4)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3 (Degree: 4)
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 8 (Degree: 4)
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7 (Degree: 3)
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 (Degree: 5)
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 9 (Degree: 4)
- Node 9: 2, 8 (Degree: 2)

Next, identify the 3-stars from nodes with degree 3 or higher:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 5)>

Finally, count the total number of 3-stars: [7]
