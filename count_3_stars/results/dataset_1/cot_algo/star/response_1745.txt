Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves: <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves: <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves: <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves: <6, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [4].
