Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, we will check nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 and Node 5 have 2 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.
- Node 3, Node 4, and Node 6 have 2 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 and Node 9 have 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<5, 2, 6, 9>
<9, 5, 4, 3>
