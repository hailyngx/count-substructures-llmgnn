Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we can calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Node 0 has neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 1 has neighbors: 5
Node 2 has neighbors: 3, 5, 8
Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 5, 8, 9
Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 7, 9
Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
Node 6 has neighbors: 5
Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9
Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7

Nodes 0, 3, 8, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars with these nodes.

For Node 0:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>

For Node 3:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>

For Node 8:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
<8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>

For Node 9:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 22

So the final answer is [22].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, 
<8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>
