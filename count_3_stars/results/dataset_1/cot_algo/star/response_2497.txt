Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 7: {2, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 1 and Node 4 have 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 and Node 9 have 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
