Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8}

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 1, 3-stars: [1]
  - <1, (3, 6, 8)>

- Node 3, 3-stars: [1]
  - <3, (1, 2, 7)>
  
- Node 8, 3-stars: [15]
  - <8, (0, 1, 3)>
  - <8, (0, 1, 4)>
  - <8, (0, 1, 6)>
  - <8, (0, 1, 7)>
  - <8, (0, 1, 9)>
  - <8, (0, 3, 4)>
  - <8, (0, 3, 6)>
  - <8, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <8, (0, 3, 9)>
  - <8, (1, 3, 4)>
  - <8, (1, 3, 6)>
  - <8, (1, 3, 7)>
  - <8, (1, 3, 9)>
  - <8, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: [17]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
