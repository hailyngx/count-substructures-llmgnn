Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 5}
- Node 2: {5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 forms one 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 8 forms one 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 7)>

There are a total of 2 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [2].
