Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4

Now, we will identify any nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2, 5, and 8 have 3 neighbors each, so we can form 1 3-star for each of these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ [4 \times \binom{3}{3}] = [4 \times 1] = [4] = 4 \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
