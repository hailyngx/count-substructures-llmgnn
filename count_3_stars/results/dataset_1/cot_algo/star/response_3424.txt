Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>.
