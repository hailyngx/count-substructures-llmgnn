Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {4, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (5, 6, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we find there are 3 3-stars in total: [3].
