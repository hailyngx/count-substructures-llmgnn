Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

0: [1, 5, 8]
1: [0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9]
2: [3, 6, 8]
3: [1, 2, 6, 9]
4: [1, 6, 8]
5: [0, 1, 9]
6: [2, 3, 4]
8: [0, 1, 2, 4]
9: [1, 3, 5]

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 1 forms 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
