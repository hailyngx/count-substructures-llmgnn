Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: 1

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 1, node 2, node 4, node 5, and node 8.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 45

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
