Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1, 5, 9 form a 3-star: <1, (5, 9)>
- Node 2, 4, 5 form a 3-star: <2, (4, 5)>
- Node 3, 6, 7 do not form 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 5, 1, 9 form a 3-star: <5, (1, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
