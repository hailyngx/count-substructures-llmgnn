Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
    1 --- 0 --- 2
    |         |   
    4         5 --- 6 --- 3
              |         |
              8 --- 7   9
```


Let's find the 3-star configurations in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7. So, it can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars:
    - <0, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <0, (1, 2, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <0, (2, 5, 7)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9. So, it can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars:
    - <1, (0, 4, 8)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (4, 8, 9)>

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 6. So, it can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars:
    - <5, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <5, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <5, (0, 7, 9)>
    - <5, (6, 7, 9)>

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 9. So, it can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars:
    - <6, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <6, (3, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (3, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9. So, it can form \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars:
    - <7, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <7, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <7, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <7, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 9. So, it can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars:
    - <8, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <8, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <8, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <8, (3, 7, 9)>

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8. So, it can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars:
    - <9, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-star configurations, we have a total of 34. So, the answer is [34].
