Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 (1 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, 7)
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 (4 3-stars with neighbors 2, 3, 4; 2, 3, 7; 2, 4, 7; 3, 4, 7)
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 (4 3-stars with neighbors 1, 3, 9; 1, 8, 9; 3, 8, 9; 1, 3, 8)
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 (4 3-stars with neighbors 0, 8, 9;  5, 8, 9; 0, 5, 9; 0, 5, 8)
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 (4 3-stars with neighbors 0, 8, 9; 1, 8, 9; 0, 1, 9; 0, 1, 8)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [17]

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>
