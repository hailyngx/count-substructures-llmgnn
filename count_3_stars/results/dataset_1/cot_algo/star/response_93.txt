Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 8

Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4] = 8 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
