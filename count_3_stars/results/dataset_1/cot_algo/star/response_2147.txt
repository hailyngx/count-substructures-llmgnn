Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 6

No nodes have less than 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 36 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
