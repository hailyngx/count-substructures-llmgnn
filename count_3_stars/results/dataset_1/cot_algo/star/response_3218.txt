Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes are 2.
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes are 0, 3.
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes are 2, 4.
- Node 4: Neighbor node is 3.
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes are 6, 9.
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes are 5, 7.
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes are 6, 9.
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes are 5, 7.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph, and the total number of 3-stars is [0].
