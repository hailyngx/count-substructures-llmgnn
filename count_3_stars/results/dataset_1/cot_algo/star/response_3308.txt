Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, 5: <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- Total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, the final result is:
[1]
