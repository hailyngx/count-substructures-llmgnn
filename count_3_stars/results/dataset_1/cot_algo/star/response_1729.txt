Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 7
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2
- Node 8: 4, 6

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 and Node 6 both have 3 neighbors, so each can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20+1+1] = [22] = 22 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 1, 8)>
