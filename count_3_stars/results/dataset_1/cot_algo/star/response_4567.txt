Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 5, 7) <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes (7, 8, 9) <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 5, 9) <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 9) <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 4 3-stars: <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 6, and they are <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>. 
So, the final answer is [6].
