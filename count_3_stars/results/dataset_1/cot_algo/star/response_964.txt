Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
