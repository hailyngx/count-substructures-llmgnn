Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 27 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
