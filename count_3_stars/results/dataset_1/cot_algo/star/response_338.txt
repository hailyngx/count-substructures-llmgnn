Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
- 0 is connected to 1, 2, and 7
- 1 is connected to 0
- 2 is connected to 0 and 8
- 3 is connected to 7
- 4 is connected to 5, 6, and 8
- 5 is connected to 4 and 8
- 6 is connected to 4 and 7
- 7 is connected to 0, 3, and 6
- 8 is connected to 2, 4, 5, and 9
- 9 is connected to 8

Let's calculate the 3-stars in this graph by checking each node:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, and 7 -> 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (less than 3) -> 0 3-stars
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, and 8 -> 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, and 9 -> 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 7)> and <4, (5, 6, 8)>.
