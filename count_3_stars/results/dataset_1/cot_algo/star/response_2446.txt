Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 6
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 5, 7

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 7, 8)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (4, 7, 9)>

Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, and <7, (3, 5, 9)>.
