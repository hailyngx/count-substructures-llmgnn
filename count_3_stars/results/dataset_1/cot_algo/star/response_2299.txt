Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 2}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
