Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6
- Node 5: 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 0, 5

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: Does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: Does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: Does not have 3 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars is \(10 + 4 = 14\), represented as [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
