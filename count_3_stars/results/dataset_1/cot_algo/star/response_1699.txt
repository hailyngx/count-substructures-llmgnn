Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 5
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 1, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

For nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9 (which have 3 neighbors each), we can form a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each node.

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, 7, 8, 9>
