Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 2, 3) <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 6, 8) <7, (4, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2, which can be represented as [2].
