Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (5, 8, -)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 5)> and <8, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6] and they are:
<1, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, -)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>
