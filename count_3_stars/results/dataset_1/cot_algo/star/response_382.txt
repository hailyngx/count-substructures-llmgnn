Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 5, and 6: <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, and 5: <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 6, and 7: <8, (0, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
