Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1

The total number of 3-stars is 4, so the answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
