Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0}

Next, let's identify any 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4] = [12]

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
