Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {5, 9}
- Node 3: {8, 9}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. (the 3-star <5, (0, 2, 7)>)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. (the 3-stars <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 7)>)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 5, so the final answer is [5].
