Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 7}

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors. Nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 12, so we have [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
