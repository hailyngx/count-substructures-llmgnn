Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 1, 5
Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 2: 1, 6, 8
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 1, 7
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 9
Node 6: 1, 2
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 1, 2
Node 9: 5

Now, let's list the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [24]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 5)>
<1, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 9, 3)>
<5, (1, 9, 3)>
