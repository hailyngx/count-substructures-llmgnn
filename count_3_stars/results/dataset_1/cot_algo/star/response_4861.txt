Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in an adjacency list format for easier visualization:

1: 8  
2: 3, 5, 6, 9  
3: 2, 4, 5, 8  
4: 3, 6, 7, 8  
5: 2, 3, 7, 8  
6: 2, 4  
7: 4, 5, 8  
8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7  
9: 2  

Now, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26 \), and the unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
