Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 7
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Node 6, 7, and 8 each have 5 neighbors, which allows us to form 10 3-stars. Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
