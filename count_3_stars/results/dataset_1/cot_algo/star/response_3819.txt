Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 38 edges, we need to find the total number of 3-stars and the unique configurations of these 3-stars.

Let's first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9} 
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7} 
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8, 9} 
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 9} 
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 8} 
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 6} 
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 0, 5, 7>
- <3, 1, 2, 9>
- <9, 1, 3, 4>
