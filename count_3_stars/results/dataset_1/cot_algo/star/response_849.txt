Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {2, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [14] \)

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 8, 8)>
- <6, (7, 8, 8)>
- <8, (6, 7, 8)>
