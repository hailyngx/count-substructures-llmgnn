Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 7

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [4 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [28] \] 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 28.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
