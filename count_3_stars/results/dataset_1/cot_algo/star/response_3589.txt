Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 7
Node 2: 9
Node 3: 6
Node 4: 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 6, 9
Node 6: 3, 4, 5
Node 7: 0
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 2, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1] = [3]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
