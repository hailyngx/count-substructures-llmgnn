Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 3, 5
- Node 1: 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 1, 4, 6, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. 
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8, so the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (7, 9, 4)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>.
