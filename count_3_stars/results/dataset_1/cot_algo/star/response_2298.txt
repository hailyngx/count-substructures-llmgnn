Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
