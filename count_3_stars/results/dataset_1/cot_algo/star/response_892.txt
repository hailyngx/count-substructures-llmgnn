Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with the described edges, we'll first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4] = 6

The 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 6)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
