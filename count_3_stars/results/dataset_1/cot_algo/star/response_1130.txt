Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 7

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors, so it can form 7 choose 3 = 35 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 35 = 55.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
