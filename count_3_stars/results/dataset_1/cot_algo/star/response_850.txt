Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 4, 6

Next, we need to identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, and Node 7 each have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 = 15

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (7, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [15].
