Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

- Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 3)> and <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (8, 9, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
