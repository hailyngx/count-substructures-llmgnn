Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 8
Node 1: 0, 3
Node 2: 6, 9
Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6
Node 4: 3, 7, 8
Node 5: 3, 7
Node 6: 2, 3, 8, 9
Node 7: 4, 5
Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 2, 6, 8

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
Node 1: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
Node 2: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
Node 3: Forms 1 3-star <3, (1, 4, 5)>
Node 4: Forms 1 3-star <4, (3, 7, 8)>
Node 5: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
Node 6: Forms 1 3-star <6, (2, 8, 9)>
Node 7: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
Node 8: Does not form a 3-star (4 neighbors)
Node 9: Does not form a 3-star (3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 3

Therefore, the final answer is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>.
