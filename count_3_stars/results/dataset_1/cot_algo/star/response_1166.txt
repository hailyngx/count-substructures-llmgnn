Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 4, 6
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10, and they are:
<[3, (0, 1, 2)]
<[3, (0, 1, 4)]
<[3, (0, 1, 9)]
<[3, (0, 2, 4)]
<[3, (0, 2, 9)]
<[3, (0, 4, 9)]
<[3, (1, 2, 4)]
<[3, (1, 4, 9)]
<[3, (2, 4, 9)]
<[3, (4, 5, 6)]
