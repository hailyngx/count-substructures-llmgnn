Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 7 (<0, (1, 2, 7)>)
- Node 1: forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 7 (<1, (0, 2, 7)>)
- Node 2: forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 6, 8 (<2, (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 8), (1, 6, 8)>)
- Node 8: forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 6, 9 (<8, (1, 2, 6), (1, 2, 8), (1, 6, 8), (2, 6, 8)>)

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [4].
