Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: \[ [4 + 1 + 56 + 4 + 10 + 20] = 95 \]

So, there are 95 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
