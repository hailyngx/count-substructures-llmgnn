Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
