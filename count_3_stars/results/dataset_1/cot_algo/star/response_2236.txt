Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
