Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 9
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 4, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 4

Next, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 0 = 11

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>.
