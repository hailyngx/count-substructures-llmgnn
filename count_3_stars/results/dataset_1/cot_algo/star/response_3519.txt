Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's look at the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 10 + 10] = 22 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (0, 5, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 5, 4)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 6, 7)>
- <6, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 6, 7)>
