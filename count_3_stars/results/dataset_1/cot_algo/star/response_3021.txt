Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 4 form the 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 and Node 4 form the 3-star: <1, (2, 8, 4)>
- Node 3 and Node 4 form the 3-star: <3, (6, 7, 4)>
- Node 4 and Node 8 form the 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 5)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [4].
