Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 6, 8}

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These are:
    - <5, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <5, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars as well:
    - <6, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <6, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (5, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors and cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars:
    - <9, (0, 3, 6)>
    - <9, (0, 3, 8)>
    - <9, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
