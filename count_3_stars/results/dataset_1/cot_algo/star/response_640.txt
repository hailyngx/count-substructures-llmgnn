Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 7: 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 = 5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
