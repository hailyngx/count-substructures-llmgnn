Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more organized way:

Node 0: 4, 5  
Node 1: 4  
Node 2: 4, 5, 9  
Node 3: 4, 5  
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8  
Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8  
Node 7: 5, 9  
Node 8: 4, 5  
Node 9: 2, 7  

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 4 can form 3-stars with nodes 1, 3, 8.
- Node 5 can form 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6], and they are:
<4, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>
