Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6
Thus, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
