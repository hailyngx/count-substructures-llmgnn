Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {5}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 24, so we write this as [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
