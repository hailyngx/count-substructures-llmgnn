Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 8}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 7, and Node 8 each have 4 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 20 + 10 = 34. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)> 

So, the final result is [34] with unique 3-stars shown above.
