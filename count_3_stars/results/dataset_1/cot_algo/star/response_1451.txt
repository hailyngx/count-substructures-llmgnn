Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 8
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 1, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors (3-star formed)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (3-star formed)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (3-star formed)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
