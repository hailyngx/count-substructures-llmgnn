Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 20 + 4 + 1] = 45 \).

The unique 3-stars formed are:
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (8, 9, 7)>
- <7, (2, 9, 5)>
- <7, (5, 0, 9)>
- <7, (5, 2, 9)>
- <7, (5, 9, 6)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <9, (5, 0, 7)>
