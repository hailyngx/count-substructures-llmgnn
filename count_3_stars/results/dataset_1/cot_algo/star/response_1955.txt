Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars.

For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 35

So, the total number of 3-stars is [35].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<1, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<2, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<4, (2, 3, 7)>,
<7, (1, 2, 6)>.
