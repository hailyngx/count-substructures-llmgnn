Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to build the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 9), (3, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 1), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 7), (9, 2)

Now, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor of 8
- Node 1: Neighbors of 3, 7, 8
- Node 2: Neighbor of 9
- Node 3: Neighbor of 1
- Node 4: Neighbors of 5, 6
- Node 5: Neighbor of 4
- Node 6: Neighbor of 4
- Node 7: Neighbors of 1, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors of 0, 1, 7
- Node 9: Neighbor of 2

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is 2, so the final answer is [2].
