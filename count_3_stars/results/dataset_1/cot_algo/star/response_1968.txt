Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 7}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 7, 9}: <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 8}: <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 8}: <7, (1, 4, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
