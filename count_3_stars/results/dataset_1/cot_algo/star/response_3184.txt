Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 29
So, the final answer is [29].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (6, 5, 7)>
- <0, (7, 5, 8)>
- <0, (8, 1, 9)>
