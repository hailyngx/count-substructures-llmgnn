Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 7, Node 9

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44, which can be represented as [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
