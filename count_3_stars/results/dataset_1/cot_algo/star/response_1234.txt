Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 8}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {4, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 7}

Next, we identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from Node 4) + 4 (from Node 6) + 4 (from Node 9) = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 7)>
