Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 2: 1, 3, 6
Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 7
Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 1, 7, 8
Node 6: 1, 2, 3
Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 5
Node 8: 1, 4, 5
Node 9: 4

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Node 1: 6 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 6 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>.
