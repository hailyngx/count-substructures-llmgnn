Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: {4, 5}
Node 1: {3, 4}
Node 2: {9}
Node 3: {1, 6, 9}
Node 4: {0, 1}
Node 5: {0}
Node 6: {3, 7, 9}
Node 7: {6, 9}
Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 6, and 9: <3, (1, 6, 9)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 7, and 9: <6, (3, 7, 9)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 6, and 7: <9, (2, 6, 7)>

There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph, therefore the total number of 3-stars is [3].
