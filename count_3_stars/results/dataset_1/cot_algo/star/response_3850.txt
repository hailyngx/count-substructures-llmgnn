Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 5
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: neighbors are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: neighbors are 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: neighbors are 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 2, 5
- Node 7: neighbors are 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: neighbors are 2, 4, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \(20 + 10 = 30\), so we put this inside brackets: [30].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
