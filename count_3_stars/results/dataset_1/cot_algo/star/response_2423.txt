Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 5

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
