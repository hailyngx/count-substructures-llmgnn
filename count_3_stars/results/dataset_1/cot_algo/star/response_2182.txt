Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, first, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9 (6 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0 (1 neighbor)
- Node 4: 7 (1 neighbor)
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: 6 (1 neighbor)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6 (3 neighbors)

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars: 
    - <0, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <0, (1, 2, 6)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <0, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <0, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <0, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <0, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <0, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <0, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <0, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <0, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <0, (1, 6, 7)>

- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
    - <6, (7, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (7, 9, 0)>
    - <6, (8, 9, 0)>
    - <6, (7, 9, 1)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 4 = 24 \), and the unique 3-stars are: 
    <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 0)>, <6, (8, 9, 0)>, <6, (7, 9, 1)>
