Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 possible 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 possible 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 possible 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 possible 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 possible 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 possible 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 possible 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 possible 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = \(10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 38\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
