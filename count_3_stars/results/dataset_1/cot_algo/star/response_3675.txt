Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's check for each node:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Thus, there is 1 3-star in total. 
Putting the final number inside brackets gives us [1].

The unique 3-star found is <7, (2, 5, 9)>.
