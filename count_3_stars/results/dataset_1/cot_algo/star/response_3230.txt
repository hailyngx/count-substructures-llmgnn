Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format to better understand the connections:

Node 0: 5, 8
Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 2: 7, 9
Node 3: 4, 5, 6
Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8
Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 8
Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 7
Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Now let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5, 8      (Neighbors: 2)
Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 8    (Neighbors: 4)
Node 2: 7, 9      (Neighbors: 2)
Node 3: 4, 5, 6    (Neighbors: 3)
Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9  (Neighbors: 5)
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8  (Neighbors: 5)
Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 9    (Neighbors: 4)
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 8    (Neighbors: 4)
Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 7    (Neighbors: 4)
Node 9: 2, 4, 6    (Neighbors: 3)

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: 0
Node 1: 1
Node 2: 0
Node 3: 0
Node 4: 1
Node 5: 0
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 0
Node 8: 0
Node 9: 0

Adding up all the 3-stars, the total number is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
