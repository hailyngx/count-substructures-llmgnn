Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0 neighbors: 5
Node 1 neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 7
Node 3 neighbors: 7, 8
Node 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 8
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 7
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 4
Node 7 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7
Node 9 neighbors: 1, 7

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10] = [14]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
