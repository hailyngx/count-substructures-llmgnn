Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
- <9, (3, 5, 7)>
