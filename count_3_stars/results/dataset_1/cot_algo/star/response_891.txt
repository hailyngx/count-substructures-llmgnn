Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, 9. <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, 9. <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, 2. <5, (8, 9, 2)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, 5. <8, (9, 7, 5)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have [4].
