Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 4, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now we'll count the number of 3-stars using the inom{n}{3} combination for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
