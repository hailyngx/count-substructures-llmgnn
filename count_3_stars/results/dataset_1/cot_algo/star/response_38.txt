Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighborhood of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {5, 7}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 1, 2, and 5 have 2, 2, and 3 neighbors respectively.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1, which can be represented as:

\[ [1] \]

The unique 3-star in the graph is:
\[ <5, (0, 2, 8)> \]
