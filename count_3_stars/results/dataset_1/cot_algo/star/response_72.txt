Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 8
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 23 \). 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 8, 6)>
- <0, (2, 8, 7)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 6)>
- <8, (0, 2, 7)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
