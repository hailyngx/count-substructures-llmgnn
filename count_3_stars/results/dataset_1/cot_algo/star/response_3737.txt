Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 4, 8
Node 1: 2, 5, 8, 9
Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 3: 0, 2
Node 4: 0
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 2, 7
Node 7: 2, 6
Node 8: 0, 1, 2
Node 9: 1

Now, we can identify the 3-stars. 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 8)>
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
<2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 10] = 15.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>,
<2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>,
<2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>,
<2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
