Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 6: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 6}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so one 3-star is formed: <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so one 3-star is formed: <7, (1, 8, 2)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (7, 8, 9)> and <7, (1, 8, 2)>.
