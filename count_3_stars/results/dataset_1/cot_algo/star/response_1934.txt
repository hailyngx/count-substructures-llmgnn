Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>
