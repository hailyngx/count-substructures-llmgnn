Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 8
Node 2: 3, 4, 6
Node 3: 1, 2, 4
Node 4: 1, 2, 3
Node 5: 1, 6, 7
Node 6: 2, 5
Node 7: 0, 5, 9
Node 8: 0, 1
Node 9: 0, 7

Now, let's check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they can form a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <7, (0, 5, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10, so the answer is [10].
