Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, giving us \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 4] = [6].
