Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 4, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 4: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 5: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 6: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 7: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 8: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 9: Does not have 3 or more neighbors

Total number of 3-stars: [4]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
