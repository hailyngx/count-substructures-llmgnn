Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have at least three neighbors: node 4, node 5, and node 6. 
Let's first determine the total number of 3-stars that can be formed in this graph.

For node 4:
Node 4 has 6 neighbors: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1}. 
So, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

For node 5:
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 4}.
So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 6:
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {2, 4, 7, 9}.
So, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 20 + 4 + 4 = 28. 

Therefore, the final answer is [28] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>
