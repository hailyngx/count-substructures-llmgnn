Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8}

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 27, which we'll put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (8, 5, 9)>
<8, (8, 8, 9)>
