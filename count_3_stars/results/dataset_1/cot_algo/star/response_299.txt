Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, 7.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 8, 9.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 8, 9.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 8, 2.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 7, 3.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [5] 3-stars.
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, 1, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8, 9>, <7, 6, 8, 2>, <8, 0, 7, 3>
