Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 7, 8
Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 3: 2, 4, 7
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 0, 3, 8
Node 8: 0, 7
Node 9: 2

Now we'll check which nodes have three or more neighbors: Node 2 and Node 7.

For Node 2:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For Node 7:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1] = 5.

The unique 3-stars found are <2, (3, 5, 6)> and <7, (0, 3, 8)>.
