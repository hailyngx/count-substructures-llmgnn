Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 ([1, 5, 7, 9]).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (8, 0, 9)>
<7, (4, 0, 1)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
