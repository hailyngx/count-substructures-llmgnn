Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first create the adjacency list for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 7, 9}
Node 1: {0, 7, 8}
Node 2: {0, 3, 5}
Node 3: {2}
Node 4: {7}
Node 5: {2, 8}
Node 6: {7, 8, 9}
Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 6, 9}
Node 8: {1, 5, 6}
Node 9: {0, 6, 7}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: No 3-star (has 2 neighbors)
Node 2: No 3-star (has 2 neighbors)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: No 3-star (has 2 neighbors)
Node 9: No 3-star (has 2 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 6) + 10 (from node 7) = 15

Therefore, there are 15 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
