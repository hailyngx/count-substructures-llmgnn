Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 1: {3, 9}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 and Node 6 also have 3 neighbors each, so they can each form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 1] = [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
