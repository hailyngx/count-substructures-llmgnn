Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 5 neighbors
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors.
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: Only 1 3-star
- For Node 6: Only 1 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>
