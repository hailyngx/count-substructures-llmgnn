Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 4, 8)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 5, 8)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 2, 9)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (7, 9, 0)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4, and they are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 0)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
