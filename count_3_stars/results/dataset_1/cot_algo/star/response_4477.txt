Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is 59, which we represent inside brackets as [59].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- <7, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
