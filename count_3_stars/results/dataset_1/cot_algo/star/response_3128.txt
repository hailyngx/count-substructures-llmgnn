Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3
- Node 5: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)  
- Node 1: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)  
- Node 3: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)  
- Node 5: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)  
- Node 7: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)  

Summing up the 3-stars from each node: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>
