Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
