Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26

So, the final result is [26] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<5, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<7, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 4, 5)>.
