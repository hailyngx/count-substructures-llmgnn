Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 6}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 2, so we have:

\[ [2] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
