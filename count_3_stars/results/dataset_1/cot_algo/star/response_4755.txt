Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 6}

Now, we need to check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form a 3-star:
- Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 12, so the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1 (2, 4, 8)>
- <3 (4, 6, 8)>
- <4 (1, 3, 7)>
- <5 (0, 6, 7)>
- <6 (3, 5, 7)>
- <9 (0, 5, 6)>
