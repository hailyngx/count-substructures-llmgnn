Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbor nodes, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbor nodes, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbor nodes, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbor nodes, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbor nodes, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbor nodes, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)> 

So, the final result is [20].
