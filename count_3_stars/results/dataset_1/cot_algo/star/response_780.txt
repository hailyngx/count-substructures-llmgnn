Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
