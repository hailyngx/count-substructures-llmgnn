Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 10] = 30 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
