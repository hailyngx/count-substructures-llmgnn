Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {6}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 5, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {5}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 3, 8}

Next, we'll calculate the 3-star configurations:
- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 2: 1 3-star can be formed.
- Node 3: 1 3-star can be formed.
- Node 4: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 8: 1 3-star can be formed.
- Node 9: 1 3-star can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1] = [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
