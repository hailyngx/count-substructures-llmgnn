Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 6

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 7, and 9: <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 also forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, and 9: <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 7, 9, and 1: <4, (7, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
