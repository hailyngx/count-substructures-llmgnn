Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph has the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1 neighbors: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2 neighbors: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 7 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 8 neighbors: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9 neighbors: {3}

Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 5 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of.
- Node 0 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = 40.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 6, 5)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 5)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 5)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (0, 2, 6)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
