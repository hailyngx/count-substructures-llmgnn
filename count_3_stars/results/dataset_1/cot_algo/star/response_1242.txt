Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
