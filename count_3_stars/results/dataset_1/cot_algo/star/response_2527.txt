Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 1: Isolated
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbor {9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars based on the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
