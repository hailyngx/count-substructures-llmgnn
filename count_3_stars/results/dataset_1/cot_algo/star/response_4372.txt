Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 3, 4}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: neighbor {4}
- Node 8: neighbor {0}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 2, 6}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 5, 6): <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 3, 5): <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 2, 9): <6, (1, 2, 9)>

So the total number of 3-stars [] = 3. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 9)>.
