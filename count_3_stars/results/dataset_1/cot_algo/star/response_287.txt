Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 8
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 6
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 6

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 7 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
