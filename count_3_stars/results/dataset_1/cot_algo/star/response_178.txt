Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in adjacency list format:

0: 6
1:
2: 4, 5, 6, 9
3: 5
4: 2, 7, 8
5: 2, 3
6: 0, 2, 8
7: 4, 8
8: 4, 6, 7
9: 2

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 has 4 neighbor nodes (4, 5, 6, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>.
