Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5, 7, 8, 9 (degree 4)
Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 9 (degree 4)
Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9 (degree 5)
Node 3: 5, 6 (degree 2)
Node 4: 1, 2, 7 (degree 3)
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8 (degree 4)
Node 6: 2, 3, 8, 9 (degree 4)
Node 7: 0, 4, 9 (degree 3)
Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 6 (degree 4)
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7 (degree 5)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 25 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [25] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
