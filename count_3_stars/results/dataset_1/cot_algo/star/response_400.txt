Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's map out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 4}
- Node 7: neighbor {4}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 2, 5}

Now, let's check each node for potential 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-star can be formed (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 3: Can form 1 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 4: Can form 1 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: Can form 1 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed (has only 1 neighbor)
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed (has only 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, and <6, (0, 1, 4)>.
