Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{2}{3}\) does not form any 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 16

So, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (2, 7, 5)>, 
<7, (6, 5, 8)>, 
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
