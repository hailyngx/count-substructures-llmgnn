Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 1: 3, 8
Node 2: 3, 4, 5
Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 8
Node 4: 2, 5
Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 8
Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 9
Node 9: 8

Next, let's identify the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the answer is [13] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
