Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, first, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {4}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {3, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {2, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 6}

Now, we can see that nodes 1 and 7 have 3 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

For node 1:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <1, 4, 7, 9>

For node 7:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <7, 1, 4, 8>
  - <7, 1, 2, 4>
  - <7, 1, 2, 8>
  - <7, 4, 8, 2>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 = 5], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, 4, 7, 9>, <7, 1, 4, 8>, <7, 1, 2, 4>, <7, 1, 2, 8>, and <7, 4, 8, 2>.
