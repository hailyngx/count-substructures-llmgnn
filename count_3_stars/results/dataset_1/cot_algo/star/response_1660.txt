Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 6

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: Not enough neighbors
- Node 4: Not enough neighbors
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: Not enough neighbors
- Node 7: Not enough neighbors

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 10] = 12.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
