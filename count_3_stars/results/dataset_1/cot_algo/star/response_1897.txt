Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {4, 6}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 25 [25] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 2, 3, 6>
- <3, 6, 7, 9>
- <3, 6, 9, 5>
- <6, 5, 2, 1>
- <6, 5, 9, 3>
- <6, 1, 3, 9>
- <6, 1, 2, 3>
- <1, 3, 6, 8>
- <1, 6, 3, 2>
- <1, 6, 3, 9>
