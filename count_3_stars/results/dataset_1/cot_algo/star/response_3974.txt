Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 8}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 7}

Next, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
