Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
