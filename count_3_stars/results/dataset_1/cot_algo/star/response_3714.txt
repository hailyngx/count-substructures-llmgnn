Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 1 neighbors: 2, 4, 6
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 8
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 7
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 7
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3
Node 7 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 2
Node 9 neighbors: 3

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 18.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, and <7, (4, 5, 6)>.
