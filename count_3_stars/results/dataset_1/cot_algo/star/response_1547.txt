Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5
- Node 7: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [33] \)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>
