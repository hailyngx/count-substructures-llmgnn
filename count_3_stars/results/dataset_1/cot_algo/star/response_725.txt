Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbor {7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbor {6}
- Node 6: Neighbor {5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbor {9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: This node has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 1: This node has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 2: This node has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 3: This node forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 4: This node forms two 3-stars: <4, (2, 3, 7)> and <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: This node has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 6: This node has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 7: This node forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 8: This node has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9: This node has 3 neighbors, forming a 3-star: <9, (3, 4, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4. Therefore, the answer is [4].
