Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 3, 8 (degree 3)
- Node 1: neighbor is 0 (degree 1)
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 4, 6, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 4: neighbors are 3, 6, 9 (degree 3)
- Node 5: neighbor is 9 (degree 1)
- Node 6: neighbors are 3, 4, 7 (degree 3)
- Node 7: neighbors are 6, 8, 9 (degree 3)
- Node 8: neighbors are 0, 7 (degree 2)
- Node 9: neighbors are 3, 4, 5, 7 (degree 4)

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars: <3, (0, 4, 6)> and <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars formed: [1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
