Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 5}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 does not form any 3-star (has fewer than 3 neighbors).
- Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 2 does not form any 3-star (has fewer than 3 neighbors).
- Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 does not form any 3-star (has fewer than 3 neighbors).
- Node 5 forms one 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 does not form any 3-star (has fewer than 3 neighbors).
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star (has fewer than 3 neighbors).
- Node 8 forms one 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star (has fewer than 3 neighbors).

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3] and they are: <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>.
