Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors = {1, 3}
- Node 1: neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors = {0, 2, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors = {5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors = {4, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors = {3, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors = {2, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors = {1, 2, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
    - <1, (0, 2, 6)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
    - <2, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <2, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <2, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <2, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <2, (3, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
    - <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
    - <6, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <6, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
    - <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>
