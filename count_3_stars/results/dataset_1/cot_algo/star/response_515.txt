Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20] = [45] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (8, 9, 1)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>

So, the final answer is \( [45] \) with the unique 3-stars listed inside <> above.
