Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 unique 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 unique 3-stars: <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 unique 3-star: <7, (4, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 10.
