Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5
- Node 3: 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5

Now, let's check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9 have 4 neighbors each
- Node 3 and 7 have 3 neighbors each

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- For nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes 3 and 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each

Total number of 3-stars: \( [5 \times 4 + 2 \times 1] = [20 + 2] = 22 \)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
