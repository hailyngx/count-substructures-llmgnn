Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Since the given graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges, we can start by listing the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 5, 9
Node 1: None
Node 2: 7, 8
Node 3: 4, 8
Node 4: 3, 8
Node 5: 0, 6, 8
Node 6: 5
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 9: 0, 8

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars around them:

Node 0: only 2 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star
Node 3: 2 neighbors
Node 4: 2 neighbors
Node 5: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star
Node 8: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: 2 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 = 12

So, the final answer is [12] and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
