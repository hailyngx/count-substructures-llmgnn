Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 7}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (8, 9, 4)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (8, 7, 1)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (9, 6, 8)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (5, 7, 4)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [5].
