Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1 = 6], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>.
