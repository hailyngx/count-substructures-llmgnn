Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {9}
Node 1: {5, 9}
Node 2: {4, 8, 9}
Node 3: {5, 6}
Node 4: {2, 7}
Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 8}
Node 6: {3, 5}
Node 7: {4}
Node 8: {2, 5, 9}
Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 8}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (5, 9)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 8, 9)>
Node 5 forms two 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 6)> and <5, (1, 6, 8)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 5, 9)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the final answer is: [5]
