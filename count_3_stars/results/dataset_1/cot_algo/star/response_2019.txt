Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5

Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8 each have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 45 3-stars, which we represent as [45].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (7, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- <8, (3, 6, 4)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (6, 1, 3)>
- <8, (6, 4, 7)>
