Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {1, 6}
Node 1: {0, 5, 8}
Node 2: {3, 5, 7}
Node 3: {2, 7, 9}
Node 4: {5, 7, 9}
Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
Node 6: {0, 5, 9}
Node 7: {2, 3, 4}
Node 8: {1, 5}
Node 9: {3, 4, 6}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 5: <5, (1, 8, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>
Node 9: <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <5, (1, 8, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, and <9, (3, 4, 6)>.
