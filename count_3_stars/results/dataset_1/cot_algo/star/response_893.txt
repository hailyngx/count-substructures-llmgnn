Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 3, 8
Node 1: 3, 5, 7
Node 3: 0, 1, 8, 9
Node 4: 8
Node 5: 1, 7
Node 7: 1, 5
Node 8: 0, 3, 4
Node 9: 3

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, and <3, (1, 8, 9)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, and <3, (1, 8, 9)>.
