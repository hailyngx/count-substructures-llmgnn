Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graph in this case consists of the following:
1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 7, and 8. Thus, it forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9. It forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars: <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (6, 3, 9)>.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9. It forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>.
4. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9. It forms \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars: <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>.
5. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: nodes 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9. It forms \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars: <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>.
6. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 5, 6, and 8. It forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars: <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>.
7. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 6, and 7. It forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars: <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>.
8. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 6, and 9. It forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [37].
