Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 4

Next, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6 (4 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 8 (4 neighbors)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
