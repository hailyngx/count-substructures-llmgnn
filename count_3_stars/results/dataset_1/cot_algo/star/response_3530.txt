Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 8: <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8: <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 9: <3, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, and <3, (6, 8, 9)>.
