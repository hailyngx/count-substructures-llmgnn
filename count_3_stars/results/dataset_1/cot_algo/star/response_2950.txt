Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 1 as the center: 
<1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>

Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 2 as the center: 
<2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 = 14, so the final answer is [14].
