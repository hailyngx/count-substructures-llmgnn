Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Calculating the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (8, 9)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (0)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 6, 8)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 7, 9)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (4, 8)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (1, 5, 8)
- Node 8: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (2, 5)

Node 0, 1, 4, 5, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with them.

For Node 0: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 1: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 5: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 48

So, the final result is: [48]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>
