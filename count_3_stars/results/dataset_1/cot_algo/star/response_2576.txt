Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 4: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 6: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors

Adding them up: 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
