Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4

Next, we identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 4 + 4] = [18] \)

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
