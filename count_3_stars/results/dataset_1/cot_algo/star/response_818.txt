Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 1: 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1, 2, 9
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 6, 7

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (less than 3, so no 3-star)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4.

Therefore, the final answer is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>.
