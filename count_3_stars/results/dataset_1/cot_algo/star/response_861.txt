Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4}

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are:
  - <1, (3, 5, 7)>
  - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
  - <1, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <1, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
