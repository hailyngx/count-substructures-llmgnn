Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with its edges:

```
0 -- 5 -- 8 -- 1 -- 3 -- 2
|         |         |
9         8         5
          |
          9
          
4 -- 6 -- 7
```

Next, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 0 3-stars
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 0 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 8, 5>
<5, 1, 2>
<5, 1, 8>
<8, 1, 5>
<8, 1, 9>
