Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {2, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8}
  
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: Cannot form a 3-star
- Node 3: Cannot form a 3-star
- Node 4: Cannot form a 3-star
- Node 5: Cannot form a 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing these up, we have a total of \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 4 \) 3-stars.
The unique 3-stars are <1, 7, 8>, <5, 2, 9>, <6, 2, 7>, and <8, 1, 9>.
