Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6
- Node 4: 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2

Now, we need to identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: forms a 3-star with (6, 7, 8)
- Node 1: forms a 3-star with (6, 7, 8)
- Node 3: forms a 3-star with (1, 2, 6)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, and <3, (1, 2, 6)>.
