Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors - 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors - 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors - 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: Neighbors - 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 4: Neighbors - 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors - 1, 4
- Node 6: Neighbors - 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: Neighbors - 1, 2
- Node 8: Neighbors - 2, 6
- Node 9: Neighbors - 0, 4

Now, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \(\binom{n}{3}\):
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 9: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 19\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 19. List of unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
