Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
Given the provided information, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 0

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

In total, we have 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final result is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>.
