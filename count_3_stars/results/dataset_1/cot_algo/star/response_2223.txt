Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (since it has only 2 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (7)>.
