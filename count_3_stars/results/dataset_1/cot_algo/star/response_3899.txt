Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 9
Node 1: 7
Node 2: 0
Node 3: 8
Node 4: 0, 6
Node 5: 9
Node 6: 4, 9
Node 7: 0, 1
Node 8: 3, 9
Node 9: 0, 5, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 4, Node 6, Node 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up, we get a total of 8 3-stars. 

Therefore, the answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
