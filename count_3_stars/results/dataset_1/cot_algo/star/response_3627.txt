Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 1: Does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 2: Does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 3: Does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star with (1, 2, 7) and inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with its 5 neighbors.
- Node 7: Does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 8: Does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9: Does not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-star found is: <4, (1, 2, 7)>.
