Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 3

Next, we look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 3, 4 3-stars formed: <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 7, 1 3-star formed: <7, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, and <7, (4, 5, 6)>.
