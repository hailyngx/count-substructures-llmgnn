Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 3: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 9: Forms two 3-stars with nodes 1, 6 and 5, 6

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, and they are:
<[6, 7, 9], [9, 1, 6]>
