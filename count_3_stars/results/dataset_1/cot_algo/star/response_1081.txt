Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 6: {8, 9}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 = 5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
