Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph, resulting in a total of [5].
