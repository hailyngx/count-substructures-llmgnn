Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 3: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 4: 2 choose 3 = 0
- Node 5: 2 choose 3 = 0
- Node 9: 4 choose 3 = 4

Total 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 16

So, there are 16 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
