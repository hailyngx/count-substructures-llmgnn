Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 4

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: No 3-stars (2 neighbors only)
- Node 2: No 3-stars (3 neighbors only)
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: No 3-stars (2 neighbors only)
- Node 5: No 3-stars (3 neighbors only)
- Node 6: No 3-stars (2 neighbors only)
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-stars (3 neighbors only)
- Node 9: No 3-stars (1 neighbor only)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 = 20

Unique 3-stars:
