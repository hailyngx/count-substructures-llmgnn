Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {4}
- Node 4: neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbor {8}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 5, 6}

Next, we identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>.
