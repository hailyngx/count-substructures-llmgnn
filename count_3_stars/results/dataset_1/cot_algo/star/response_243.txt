Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4}

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
