Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (5 neighbors)
- Node 1: 4, 7, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 (5 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1 (1 neighbor)

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 5 neighbors (can form 3-stars) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1, 4 neighbors (can form 3-stars) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3, 4 neighbors (can form 3-stars) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4, 4 neighbors (can form 3-stars) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5, 5 neighbors (can form 3-stars) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8, 5 neighbors (can form 3-stars) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = 42

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
