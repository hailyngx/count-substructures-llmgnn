Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Node 1, 2, 5, and 8 have 5, 5, 5, and 4 neighbors respectively, which means they can form 10, 10, 10, and 4 3-stars respectively. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 3, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (7, 2, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (0, 1, 7)>
- <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
