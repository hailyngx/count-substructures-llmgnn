Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7

Next, we need to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star. 

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 2, 9)>
<0, (5, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
