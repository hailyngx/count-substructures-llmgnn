Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {2, 7}
Node 1: {3, 6, 7, 9}
Node 2: {0, 6}
Node 3: {1}
Node 4: {8, 9}
Node 5: {8, 9}
Node 6: {1, 2}
Node 7: {0, 1}
Node 8: {4, 5}
Node 9: {1, 4, 5}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars. For each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it is part of:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [5]

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 1)>
