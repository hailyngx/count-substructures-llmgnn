Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 9}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {2, 9}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \([4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4] = 13\)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <1, (2, 9, 6)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 2, 6)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
