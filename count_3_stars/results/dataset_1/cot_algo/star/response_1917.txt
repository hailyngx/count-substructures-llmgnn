Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 0 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 0 3-star
- Node 5: 0 3-star
- Node 7: 0 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-star

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 9, 2)>
<2, (3, 8, 7)>
