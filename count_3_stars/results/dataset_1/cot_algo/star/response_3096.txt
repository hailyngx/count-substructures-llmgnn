Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 3, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 3 neighbors: 1
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 8, 9
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 2, 5
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 4, 5), resulting in <0, (1, 4, 5)>.
Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors (4, 5, 8), resulting in <2, (4, 5, 8)>.
Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 2, 9), resulting in <5, (0, 2, 9)>.
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 4, 5), resulting in <9, (1, 4, 5)>.

The total number of 3-stars is 4, so the final answer is [4].
