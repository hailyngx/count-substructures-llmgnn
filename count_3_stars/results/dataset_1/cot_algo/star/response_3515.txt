Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a table to represent the neighbors of each node:

| Node | Neighbors      |
|------|----------------|
| 0    | 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 |
| 1    | 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 |
| 2    | 1, 6 |
| 3    | 0, 1, 5 |
| 4    | 0, 1, 5, 6, 7 |
| 5    | 3, 4, 8 |
| 6    | 1, 2, 4 |
| 7    | 0, 4 |
| 8    | 0, 5, 9 |
| 9    | 1, 8 |

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form a 3-star as it has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 can form a 3-star as it has 6 neighbors.
- Node 4 can form a 3-star as it has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 can form a 3-star as it has 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding all possible 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>.
