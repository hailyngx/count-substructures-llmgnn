Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 7}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12\)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
