Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 4, 6
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 2: 9
Node 3: 1, 6, 7
Node 4: 0, 1, 9
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 3, 6, 9
Node 8: 1, 6
Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to see if they form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 1: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 6: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 4] = 46

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
