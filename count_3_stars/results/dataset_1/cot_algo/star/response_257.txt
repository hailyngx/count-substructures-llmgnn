Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8}

Now, let's check for 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom(4, 3) = 4 Choose 3 = 4 ways
   - <0, (2, 4, 6)>
   - <0, (2, 4, 7)>
   - <0, (4, 6, 7)>
   - <0, (2, 6, 7)>

- Node 4: inom(4, 3) = 4 Choose 3 = 4 ways
   - <4, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <4, (0, 1, 8)>
   - <4, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <4, (0, 2, 8)>

- Node 8: inom(3, 3) = 1 way
   - <8, (1, 4, 9)>

Adding them up, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 1 = 9]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
