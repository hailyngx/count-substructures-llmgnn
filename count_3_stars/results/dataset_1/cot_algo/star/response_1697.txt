Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>
