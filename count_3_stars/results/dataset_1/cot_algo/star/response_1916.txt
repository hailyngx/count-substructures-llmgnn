Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 8 (Degree: 4)
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7 (Degree: 4)
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Degree: 5)
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 (Degree: 6)
- Node 4: 1, 3, 9 (Degree: 3)
- Node 5: 2, 3, 9 (Degree: 3)
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7 (Degree: 4)
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 (Degree: 5)
- Node 8: 0, 2, 9 (Degree: 3)
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8 (Degree: 3)

Now, we look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 9

For nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Since each of these nodes forms 1 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4. 

Therefore, we can represent the 3-stars as:
<4, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>

So, the final result is [4].
