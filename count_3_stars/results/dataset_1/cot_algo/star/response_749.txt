Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format:

Node 0: 7  
Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 9  
Node 3: 1, 5, 6   
Node 4: 1, 7, 9  
Node 5: 1, 3, 8  
Node 6: 3  
Node 7: 0, 4, 8  
Node 8: 5, 7  
Node 9: 1, 4  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].

The 3-stars are:  
<1, (3, 4, 5)>  
<1, (3, 4, 9)>  
<1, (3, 5, 9)>  
<1, (4, 5, 9)>  
<3, (1, 5, 6)>  
<4, (1, 7, 9)>  
<5, (1, 3, 8)>  
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
