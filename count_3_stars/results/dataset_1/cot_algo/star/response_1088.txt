Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 7 \)

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>
