Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we'll first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 can form a 3-star with neighbors {0, 3, 4} - <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 7} - <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 4} - <7, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>.
