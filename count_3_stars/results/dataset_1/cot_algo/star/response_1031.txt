Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 6, 8
Node 1: 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 2: 1, 3, 6
Node 3: 2, 7, 8, 9
Node 4: 7
Node 5: 6, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5
Node 7: 3, 4
Node 8: 0, 1, 3
Node 9: 1, 3, 5

Now let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars centered at those nodes:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [5]

List of unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
