Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 6

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 6) = 41

So, the final answer is [41]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 5)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 5)>
<0, (4, 9, 5)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 5)>
<0, (6, 9, 5)>
<0, (7, 9, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 5)>
<6, (4, 9, 5)>
<6, (7, 9, 5)>
