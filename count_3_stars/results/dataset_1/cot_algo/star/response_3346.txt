Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6, 8

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 = 8, so we have [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 1)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (6, 1, 8)>
