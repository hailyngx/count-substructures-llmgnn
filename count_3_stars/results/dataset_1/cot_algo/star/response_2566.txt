Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list out the neighbor nodes for each of the 10 nodes:

- Node 0: Neighbor nodes {8}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes {7}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes {3}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes {2, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes {5}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes {5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes {1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes {0, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes {5, 6}

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {2, 5, 6}   <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms three 3-stars:
  - With nodes {2, 4, 6}    <5, (2, 4, 6)>
  - With nodes {3, 4, 6}    <5, (3, 4, 6)>
  - With nodes {3, 6, 9}    <5, (3, 6, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we find 4 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
