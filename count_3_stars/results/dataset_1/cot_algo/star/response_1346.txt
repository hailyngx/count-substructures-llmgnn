Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4
- Node 7: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 6 neighbors
- Node 4, 5 neighbors
- Node 7, 4 neighbors
- Node 9, 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 4 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
