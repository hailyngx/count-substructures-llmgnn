Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
   0 ---- 2 ---- 1 ---- 3 ---- 6
   |       |     |     |     |
   5       4     |     |     7
                 8     9
```

Now, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {3, 4}

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 have 3 or more neighbors. We can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 35, which can be represented as [35].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
