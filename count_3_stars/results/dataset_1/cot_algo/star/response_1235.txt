Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7

Next, we see that nodes 0, 2, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 2)>
<9, (2, 7, 0)> 

So, the final result is [9].
