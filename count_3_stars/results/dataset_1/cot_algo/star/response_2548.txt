Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 8
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

For nodes with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: None
- Node 6: None
- Node 7: None
- Node 8: None
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 18

Therefore, the final answer is [18] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>
