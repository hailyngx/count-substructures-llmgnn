Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 6}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>
