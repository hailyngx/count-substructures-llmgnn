Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 7}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 0 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 0 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 0 3-star
- Node 6: 0 3-star
- Node 7: 2 3-stars
- Node 8: 0 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and they are:

<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
