Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 4, 8, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 3, 6, 8}
Node 2 neighbors: {4, 5, 9}
Node 3 neighbors: {1, 5}
Node 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 7}
Node 5 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 6}
Node 6 neighbors: {1, 5, 9}
Node 7 neighbor: {4}
Node 8 neighbors: {0, 1, 9}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 2, 6, 8}

Now we can identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 8, 9) <0, (1, 8, 9)>
Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 6, 8) <1, (0, 6, 8)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 5, 9) <6, (1, 5, 9)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 1, 9) <8, (0, 1, 9)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 6, 8) <9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>.
