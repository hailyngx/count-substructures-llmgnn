Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [30]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 1, 4, 7>
- <1, 0, 5, 7>
- <3, 0, 2, 6>
- <4, 0, 7, 9>
- <5, 1, 2, 8>
- <7, 0, 1, 9>
- <9, 1, 3, 4, 5>
