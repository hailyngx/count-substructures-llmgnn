Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graph with the given nodes and edges is as follows: 

Total number of 3-stars: [8]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 1)>
<2, (0, 5, 3)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 4)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
