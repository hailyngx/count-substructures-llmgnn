Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 3 and 7.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 7 and 9.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 3: Neighbor is 0.
- Node 4: Neighbor is 2.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 2 and 7.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 1, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 8: Neighbor is 7.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1 and 6.

Next, let's identify any 3-stars in the graph. For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 10 = 12, which we will represent as [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
