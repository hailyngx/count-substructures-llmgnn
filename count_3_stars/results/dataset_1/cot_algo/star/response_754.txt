Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 7}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}

Now let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 5 forms the following 3-star: <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 7 forms the following 3-star: <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms the following 3-star: <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 (since we only count unique 3-stars).

Therefore, the final result is [4].
