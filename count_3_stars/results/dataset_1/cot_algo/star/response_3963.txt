Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 8

Now we can identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, and 8 have 5 neighbors each.

For these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>
