Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 8, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 5
- Node 3 neighbors: 4
- Node 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 2, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 7, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 6, 7
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars. We see that nodes 0, 4, and 7 each have exactly 3 neighbors. So, we have 3 3-stars formed with these nodes.
The total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 9>
<4, 3, 7>
<7, 6, 8>
