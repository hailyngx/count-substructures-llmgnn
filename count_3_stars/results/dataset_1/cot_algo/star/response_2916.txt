Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 6, 8
Node 1: 2, 7, 9
Node 2: 1, 4, 7
Node 3: 6, 8
Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 8
Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 3, 5
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
Node 9: 1, 7

Next, we check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 40

So, there are a total of 40 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
