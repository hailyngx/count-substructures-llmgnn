Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14, which can be represented as [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 5, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>.
