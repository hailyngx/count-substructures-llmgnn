Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 1 = 12 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 8, 7)>
<0, (5, 8, 7)>
<0, (6, 8, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 2)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
