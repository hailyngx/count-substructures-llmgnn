Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7

Next, we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 13

So, the final answer is [13].
The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
- <8, (0, 6, 5)>
- <8, (6, 5, 0)>
- <8, (6, 7, 0)>
- <0, (7, 8, 4)>
