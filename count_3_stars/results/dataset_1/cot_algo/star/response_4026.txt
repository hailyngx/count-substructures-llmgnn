Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 5 have 5, 5, 4, and 4 neighbors respectively.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 4 = 24, which can be represented as [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (7, 9, 5)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
