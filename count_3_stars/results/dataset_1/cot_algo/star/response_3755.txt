Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the neighbor nodes of each node. 

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 4, 6
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 3, 5
Node 2 neighbors: 9
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 6
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 1
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 6, 7, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 6) = 12. 

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, and <6, (0, 3, 7)>.
