Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3}

Now, let's look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, form 1 3-star with center node 1: <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, form 1 3-star with center node 4: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, form 1 3-star with center node 8: <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, form 1 3-star with center node 9: <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have [4].
