Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 (6 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 3 (1 neighbor)
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: 3 (1 neighbor)
- Node 5: 0, 6, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 5 (1 neighbor)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5 (3 neighbors)

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
