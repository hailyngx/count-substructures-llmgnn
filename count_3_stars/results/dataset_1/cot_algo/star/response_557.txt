Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Summing up, there are 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, and <9, (0, 4, 5)>.
