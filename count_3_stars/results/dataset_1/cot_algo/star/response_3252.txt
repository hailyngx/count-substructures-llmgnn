Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Since a 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we'll first find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 4, 8
Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 7
Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
Node 3: Neighbors are 5
Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 5, 6, 9
Node 5: Neighbors are 3, 4, 8
Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: Neighbors are 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars present in this graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 7)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 9)>
Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 7)> and <6, (4, 7, 9)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 6)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 5, 6)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
