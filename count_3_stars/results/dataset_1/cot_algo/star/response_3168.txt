Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 and Node 3 both have 4 neighbors, so they each contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 4 + 1] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
