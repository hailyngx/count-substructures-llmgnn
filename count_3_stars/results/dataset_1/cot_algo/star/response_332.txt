Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 2 neighbors: {3, 7}
- Node 3 neighbors: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 4 neighbors: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5 neighbors: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 6 neighbors: {4, 8}
- Node 7 neighbors: {2, 5}
- Node 8 neighbors: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9 neighbors: {8}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <8, (4, 6, 9)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1] = 6. The unique 3-stars found are <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, and <8, (4, 6, 9)>.
