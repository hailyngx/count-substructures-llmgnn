Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 7: <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 6: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, 5: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, 4: <5, (0, 3, 4)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
