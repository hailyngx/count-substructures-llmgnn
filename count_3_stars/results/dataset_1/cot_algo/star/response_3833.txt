Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, let's first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 8}
Node 1: {2, 5, 6}
Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
Node 3: {0, 7}
Node 4: {5, 6, 7}
Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 9}
Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 5}
Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 9}
Node 9: {6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 5: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the final answer is [45], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
