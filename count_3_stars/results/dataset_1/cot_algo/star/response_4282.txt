Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 6}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 5}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 5, Node 7

For these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 0: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 10 = 15]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>
