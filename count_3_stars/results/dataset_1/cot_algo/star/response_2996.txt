Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 7
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 1, 6

Next, we'll look at the nodes with three or more neighbors to see if they form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- For Node 0, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 2, there are \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 4, there is \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 6, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. The 3-star is <6, (4, 5, 9)>.
- For Node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>.
- For Node 9, there is \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Finally, adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0] = [5] \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.
