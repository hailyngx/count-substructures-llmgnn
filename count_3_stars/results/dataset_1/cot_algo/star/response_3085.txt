Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We will first create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 3, 5
Node 1: 3, 7     
Node 2: 4, 5, 8     
Node 3: 0, 1, 8     
Node 4: 2     
Node 5: 0, 2, 6     
Node 6: 5     
Node 7: 1, 9     
Node 8: 2, 3, 9     
Node 9: 7, 8     

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Nodes 2 and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will consider them for forming 3-stars.

For node 2:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
So, node 2 forms 1 3-star.

For node 8:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
So, node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2: [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
