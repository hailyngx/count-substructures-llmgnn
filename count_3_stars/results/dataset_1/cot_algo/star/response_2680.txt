Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 5}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (2, 5, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars formed is [5].
