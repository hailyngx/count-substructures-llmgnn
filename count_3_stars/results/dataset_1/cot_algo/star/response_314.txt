Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

Node 0 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 3, 6
Node 2 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 2, 6
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes forming 3-stars: 0, 2, 7, 9

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 44]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
