Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbor {6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (6, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 4) + 4 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 8) = 7, so the answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, and <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
