Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are:

[4]

<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
