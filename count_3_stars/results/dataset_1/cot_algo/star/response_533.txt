Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7
- Node 4: 0
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4] \]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (3, 6, 8)>
