Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
1: 4, 5, 9
2: 3, 4, 6
3: 2, 5, 6
4: 1, 2, 8, 9
5: 1, 3
6: 2, 3, 9
8: 4
9: 1, 4, 6

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:
Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1] = 6

Unique 3-stars found: 
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
