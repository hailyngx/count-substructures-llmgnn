Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars starting from each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 78 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [78] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
