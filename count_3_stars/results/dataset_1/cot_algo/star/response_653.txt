Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 3}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 21. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- <9, (2, 7, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
