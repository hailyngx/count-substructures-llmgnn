Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 1: {4, 5, 9}
Node 3: {7, 9}
Node 4: {1, 6, 8}
Node 5: {1}
Node 6: {4}
Node 7: {3}
Node 8: {4}
Node 9: {1, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms one 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 9}: <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 4 forms one 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 8}: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star with neighbors {1, 3, 9}: <9, (1, 3, 9)>

Summing up, we have a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph.
