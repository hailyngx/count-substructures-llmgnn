Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Now, we need to find the 3-stars:

- For Node 1, there are 2*1=2 3-stars.
    - <1, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 9)>

- For Node 2, there are \(inom{3}{3}\)=1 3-star.
    - <2, (1, 5, 7)>

- For Node 5, there are 2*1=2 3-stars.
    - <5, (2, 1, 7)>
    - <5, (2, 1, 9)>

- For Node 6, there are \(inom{2}{3}\)=0 3-stars.

- For Node 7, there are 1 3-star.
    - <7, (2, 1, 3)>

Adding them up: \[2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
