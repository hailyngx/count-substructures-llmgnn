Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars and list them, we will first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {7, 9}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)

Adding these up:
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [11] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
\[ <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 9, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 8)> \]
