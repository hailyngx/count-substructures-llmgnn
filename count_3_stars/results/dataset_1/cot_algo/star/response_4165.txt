Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:  

Node 0: 4  
Node 1: 6  
Node 2: 3  
Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 9  
Node 4: 0, 3, 9  
Node 6: 1, 3  
Node 7: 8  
Node 8: 7, 9  
Node 9: 3, 4, 8  

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:  

From the neighbors' information, nodes 3, 4, and 9 have at least 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.  
Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:  
<3, (2, 4, 9)>  
<3, (4, 6, 9)>  
<3, (2, 4, 6)>  
<3, (4, 6, 9)>  

Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star:  
<4, (0, 3, 9)>  

Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star:  
<9, (3, 4, 8)>  

So, the total number of 3-stars is 6, which can be written as [6].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<3, (2, 4, 9)>  
<3, (4, 6, 9)>  
<3, (2, 4, 6)>  
<4, (0, 3, 9)>  
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
