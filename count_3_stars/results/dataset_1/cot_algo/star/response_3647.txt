Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 8}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 7}
Node 2 neighbors: {0, 4, 7}
Node 3 neighbors: {8}
Node 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 7, 8}
Node 5 neighbors: {6, 7}
Node 6 neighbors: {5}
Node 7 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 5}
Node 8 neighbors: {0, 3, 4}

Now, we will check each node with three or more neighbors for the formation of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 0, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 8)>
