Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 7
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 1

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 1 forms 0 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2 forms 0 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph: <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, and <8, (1, 5, 8)>.
