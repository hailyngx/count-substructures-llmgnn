Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 1: Has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 3: Has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 5: Has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 8: Has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 8.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 68

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
