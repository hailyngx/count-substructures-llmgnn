Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors forming 1 3-star. <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors so it does not form a 3-star.

Thus, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in the graph.
