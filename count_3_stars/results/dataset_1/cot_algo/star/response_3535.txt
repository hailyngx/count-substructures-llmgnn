Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 0 3-star
- Node 1: 0 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 4: 1 3-star <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: 1 3-star <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 8: 1 3-star <8, (0, 2, 4)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [3]

Thus, the unique 3-stars are: <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>.
