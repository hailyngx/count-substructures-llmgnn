Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
