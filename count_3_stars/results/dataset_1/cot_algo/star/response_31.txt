Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with the provided information, we can determine the 3-stars present in the graph by examining the neighbors of each node.

Node 0: Neighbors = {4}
Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 7, 9}
Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 7}
Node 3: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 5, 8}
Node 5: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6}
Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5}
Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3}
Node 8: Neighbors = {3, 4}
Node 9: Neighbors = {1}

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 4 = 9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (2, 5, 7)>
