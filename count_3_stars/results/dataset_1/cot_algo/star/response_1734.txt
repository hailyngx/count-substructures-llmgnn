Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 7
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 2
Node 4: 0
Node 5: 0
Node 6: 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 8
Node 8: 7, 9
Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4] = 8.
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>.
