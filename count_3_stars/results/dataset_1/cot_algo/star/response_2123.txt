Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

Node 0 has neighbors: 5, 9
Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 6
Node 2 has neighbors: 3, 7
Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 8
Node 4 has neighbors: 9
Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 8
Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 3
Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 8, 9
Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 5, 7
Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 4, 7

Considering any node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors: 2, 5, 6
Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors: 0, 1, 8
Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors: 3, 5, 7
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors: 0, 4, 7

Since all these nodes have exactly 3 neighbors, each of them forms exactly one 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the provided graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
