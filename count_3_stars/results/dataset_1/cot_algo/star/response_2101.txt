Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of nodes in the graph is 10.

Now, let's calculate the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, we will check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 35 = 63

Therefore, the final answer is [63] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (9, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 9, 4)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
- <9, (3, 0, 5)>
- <9, (3, 1, 4)>
- <9, (3, 1, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
- <9, (5, 0, 1)>
- <9, (5, 0, 4)>
- <9, (5, 1, 4)>
- <9, (5, 1, 8)>
- <9, (6, 4, 9)>
