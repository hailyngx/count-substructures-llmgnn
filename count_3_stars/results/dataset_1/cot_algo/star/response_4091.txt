Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 1
Node 4: 6, 9
Node 5: 1, 8
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 8, 9
Node 8: 5, 7
Node 9: 4, 7

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4, 5, 7, and 9 each have 2 neighbors which is less than 3 and are not considered further.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars possible with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Possible 3-stars for node 1 are: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars: [4]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>
