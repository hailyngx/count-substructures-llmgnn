Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {6, 8}
Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
Node 2: Neighbors {7}
Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 7, 8}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}
Node 5: Neighbors {4, 8}
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 7}
Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5}

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 3 forms a 3-star: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4 forms a 3-star: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 8 forms a 3-star: inom{4}{3} = 4

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
