Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {5}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 7 3-stars: [7]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
