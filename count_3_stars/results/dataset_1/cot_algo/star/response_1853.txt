Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 8

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 14 3-stars.

Therefore, the answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 1)>
<4, (6, 8, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<8, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (1, 8, 3)>
