Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 8

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of unique 3-stars:
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, which we denote as [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>

These 3-stars represent the unique combinations where a node is the center connected to exactly three other nodes.
