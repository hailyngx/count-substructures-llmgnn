Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 4

Now, we can see that nodes 2, 4, and 5 have 4 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 = 9]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
