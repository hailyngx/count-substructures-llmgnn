Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
    1 -- 4 -- 7       0
         |   |      /|\
         2 -- 8    6 9
          \ |     /  /
            3 -- 5
```

Next, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 1, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 35, which we will represent inside brackets [].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 3)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>

Thus, the final result is: [35].
