Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4
- Node 1: 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 15.
Thus, the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>
