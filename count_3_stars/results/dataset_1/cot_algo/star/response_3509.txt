Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graph in this case contains the following information: 

- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4, and 9. As it has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
  <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>

- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, and 6. As it has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>

- Node 3: Neighbors are 2, 5, and 8. As it has 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star.
  <3, (2, 5, 8)>

- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 2, and 6. As it has 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star.
  <4, (1, 2, 6)>

- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 4, 7, and 8. As it has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>

- Node 8: Neighbors are 3, 6, and 9. As it has 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star.
  <8, (3, 6, 9)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [15], and the unique 3-stars formed are <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>.
