Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 5

Therefore, the answer is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 1)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>
