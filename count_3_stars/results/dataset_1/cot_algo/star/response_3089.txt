Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 also has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- All other nodes have fewer than 3 neighbors, so no additional 3-stars are formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 = 8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
