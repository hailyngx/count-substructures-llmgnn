Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [18], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
