Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars using the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7, which can be represented as [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
