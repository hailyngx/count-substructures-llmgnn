Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 5}

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 39

Inside brackets [], we have: [39]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
