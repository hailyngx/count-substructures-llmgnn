Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) (35 unique 3-stars)

Counting all the unique 3-stars gives us a total of 49. Therefore, the answer is [49], and the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 8, 1)>, <9, (0, 8, 2)>, <9, (0, 8, 4)>, <9, (0, 8, 5)>, <9, (1, 8, 4)>, <9, (1, 8, 5)>, <9, (2, 8, 4)>, <9, (2, 8, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>
