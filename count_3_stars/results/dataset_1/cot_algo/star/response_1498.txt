Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list based on the given edge information:

Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 9  
Node 1: 0  
Node 2: 4, 8  
Node 3: 7  
Node 4: 2, 8, 9  
Node 5: 0  
Node 7: 0, 3  
Node 8: 2, 4  
Node 9: 0, 4  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4  
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1  

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 = 5.  

Thus, the final answer is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 5, 7)>  
<0, (1, 5, 9)>  
<0, (7, 5, 9)>  
<4, (2, 8, 9)>  
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
