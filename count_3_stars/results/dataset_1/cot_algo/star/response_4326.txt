Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 7}: <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 8, 9}: <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 forms two 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 5)> and <7, (8, 9, 2)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 5, 7}: <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
