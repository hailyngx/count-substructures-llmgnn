Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 6 neighbors, so \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 38 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
