Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor nodes = {5}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes = {5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes = {3, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes = {2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes = {2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes = {0, 1, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes = {1, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes = {1}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes = {4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes = {3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 5, 8)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in total, so the final result is [5].
