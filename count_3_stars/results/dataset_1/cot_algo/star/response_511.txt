Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 8}

Now, let's check for 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 4 both have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 1: <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
