Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {1, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 = 9]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
