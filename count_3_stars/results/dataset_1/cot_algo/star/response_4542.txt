Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the graph and identify them, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>.
