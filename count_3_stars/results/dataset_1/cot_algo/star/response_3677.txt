Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 5, 8). -> <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 5, 9). -> <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 8, 9). -> <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 8, 9). -> <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes (8, 3, 9). -> <2, (8, 3, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (8, 3, 9). -> <5, (8, 3, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes (3, 9, 5). -> <8, (3, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
