Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 = 9]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
