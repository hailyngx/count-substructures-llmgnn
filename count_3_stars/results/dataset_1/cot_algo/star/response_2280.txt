Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

So, there are a total of 7 3-stars in this graph:

[7]

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>
