Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 3: forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 0, 3}
- Node 6: forms 3-stars with the following neighbors:
  - {1, 4, 5}
  - {1, 4, 8}
  - {1, 4, 9}

Counting the unique 3-stars:
- Number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 3) + 1 (from Node 4) + 3 (from Node 6) = 6
- So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
