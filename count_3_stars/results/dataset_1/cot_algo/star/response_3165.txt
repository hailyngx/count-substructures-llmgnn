Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges as described. 

Now, we will find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {2, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 2, and 6 have 2, 5, and 3 neighbors respectively, so they do not form any 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 and 9 have 3 and 2 neighbors respectively, so they also do not form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 and 8 have 5 and 2 neighbors respectively, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Adding them up: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 16 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, and <5, (1, 2, 3)>.
