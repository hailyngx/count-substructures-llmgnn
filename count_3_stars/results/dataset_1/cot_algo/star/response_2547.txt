Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 7, 8

Next, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed <2, (4, 6, 8)>.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 4. These are <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 5. These are <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 6. These are <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 7. These are <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 8. These are <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>.
The total number of 3-stars is [42].
