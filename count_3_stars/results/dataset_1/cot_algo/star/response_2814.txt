Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 6}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 6}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1] 
- Node 3: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1]
- Node 6: [\( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10]
- Node 9: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4]

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 16]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 7, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, 6)>
