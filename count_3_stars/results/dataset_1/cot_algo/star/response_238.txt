Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbor(s) = 1
Node 1: Neighbor(s) = 0, 5, 6, 9
Node 2: Neighbor(s) = 3, 4
Node 3: Neighbor(s) = 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 4: Neighbor(s) = 2, 3, 9
Node 5: Neighbor(s) = 1, 3, 7, 8
Node 6: Neighbor(s) = 1
Node 7: Neighbor(s) = 3, 5, 9
Node 8: Neighbor(s) = 3, 5
Node 9: Neighbor(s) = 1, 3, 4, 7

Now, let's check for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to see if they form 3-stars:

Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 20 + 4 + 4] = [32]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
