Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 and Node 7 have 3 neighbors each.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with the nodes having 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 5, which we'll represent as [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (4, 7, 6)>
- <7, (4, 2, 9)>
- <7, (4, 2, 6)>
- <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
