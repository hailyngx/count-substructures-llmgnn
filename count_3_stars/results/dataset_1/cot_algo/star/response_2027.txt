Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:
```
   0 -- 4 -- 7
   |    |    |
   6 -- 9 -- 5
   |    |    |
   1 -- 3 -- 2
       |
       8
```

Now, let's determine the unique 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors (4, 6).
Node 1 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 6).
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5).
Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 6).
Node 4 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 6, 7) - can form 10 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 9).
Node 6 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9) - can form 20 3-stars.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors (4, 8).
Node 8 has 2 neighbors (6, 7).
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 6).

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
- For node 4, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 20 = 30.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 1, 2)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
