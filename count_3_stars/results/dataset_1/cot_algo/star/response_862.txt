Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 7
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 7
- Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 2, 3
- Node 8 neighbors: 6
- Node 9 neighbors: 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 and Node 1 have more than 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
