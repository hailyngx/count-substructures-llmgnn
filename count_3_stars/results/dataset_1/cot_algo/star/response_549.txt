Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 15

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
