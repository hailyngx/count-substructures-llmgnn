Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {1, 4}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 7): [<1, (2, 3, 7)>]
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8): [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8): [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 7, 9): [<4, (3, 5, 9)>]
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 8, 9): [<5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 5, 9)>]
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 9): [<8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>]

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 3 + 2] = [47]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<2, 3, 8)>, 
<3, 4, 9)>, 
<4, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<5, (4, 5, 9)>
