Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {7}
- Node 5: neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 20 + 10 = 40, so the final result is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <1, (8, 9, 4)>
- <1, (8, 9, 3)>
- <1, (8, 9, 9)>
- <1, (8, 9, 7)>
- <1, (8, 9, 6)>
- <1, (8, 9, 5)>
- <7, (0, 9, 6)>
- <7, (0, 9, 5)>
- <7, (0, 9, 2)>
- <7, (1, 8, 6)>
- <7, (1, 8, 5)>
- <7, (1, 8, 2)>
- <7, (3, 8, 6)>
- <7, (3, 8, 5)>
- <7, (6, 9, 5)>
- <7, (8, 5, 6)>
- <7, (9, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 8, 2)>
- <9, (1, 8, 5)>
- <9, (3, 8, 6)>
- <9, (6, 7, 5)>
- <9, (8, 5, 6)>
