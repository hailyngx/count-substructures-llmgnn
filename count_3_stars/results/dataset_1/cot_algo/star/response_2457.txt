Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 6
Node 1: 0, 2, 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 8
Node 3: 6
Node 4: 5, 8
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 6
Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6
Node 9: 1, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 6 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the final answer is [33] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>.
