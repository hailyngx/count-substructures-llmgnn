Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 4 and 6.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 2.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 6 and 9.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 2.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 5.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 2 each have 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 also has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <1, (2, 7, 8)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 2, 7)>
  
Putting it all together, [3], <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>
