Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {3, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {7}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 2, and 9: <3, (1, 2, 9)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 5, and 7: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 4, and 9: <5, (0, 4, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
