Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
