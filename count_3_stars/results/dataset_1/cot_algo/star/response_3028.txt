Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star <0, (2, 3, 5)>.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star <1, (3, 4, 9)>.
- Node 3 forms three 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>.
- Node 4 forms one 3-star <4, (1, 3, 5)>.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star <5, (0, 4, 7)>.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star <6, (3, 4, 9)>.
- Node 9 forms one 3-star <9, (1, 6, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 7, which we represent as [7].
