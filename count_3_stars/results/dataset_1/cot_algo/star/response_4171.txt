Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (6, 7, 8)> and <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (4, 7, 8)>
  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, which we represent as [4].
