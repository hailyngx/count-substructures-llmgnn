Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 35

Therefore, the final answer is [35] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, and <9, (0, 3, 4)>.
