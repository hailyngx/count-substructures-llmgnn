Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 3 -- 8
|    |  / |
|    | /  |
4    0    6 -- 9 -- 2
|         |    |    |
5 -- 9 -- 7    5    1
```

For each node, let's find its neighbor nodes:

- Node 0: neighbors are 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: neighbor is 7
- Node 2: neighbor is 9
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 8
- Node 4: neighbor is 0
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: neighbor is 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 0, 3, 6
- Node 9: neighbors are 2, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars. <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 4: has only 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 3C3 = 1 3-star. <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 3C3 = 1 3-star. <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 3C3 = 1 3-star. <8, (0, 6, 3)>
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars. <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [11] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 3)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
