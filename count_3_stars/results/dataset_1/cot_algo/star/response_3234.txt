Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
