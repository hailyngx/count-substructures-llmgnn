Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6, 7}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 21, denoted as [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 9)>
