Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Since we know the graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges, we can create the adjacency list for each node:

Node 0: 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 2
Node 5: 2, 7
Node 6: 3, 7, 9
Node 7: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 7
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \([20 + 10 + 10] = 40\)

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 40.
