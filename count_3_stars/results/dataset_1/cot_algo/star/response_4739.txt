Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: {6}

Node 1: {2, 4, 5}

Node 2: {1, 5, 6}

Node 3: {5, 8}

Node 4: {1, 9}

Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 7}

Node 6: {0, 2, 9}

Node 7: {5, 8}

Node 8: {3, 7}

Node 9: {4, 6}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 7

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 4, 5), (3, 5, 7), (5, 1, 2), (9, 4, 6)>
