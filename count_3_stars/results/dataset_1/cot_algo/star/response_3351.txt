Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (8, 9, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms two 3-stars: <8, (0, 2, 5)> and <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
