Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

Adding these up: [10 + 20 + 20] = [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
