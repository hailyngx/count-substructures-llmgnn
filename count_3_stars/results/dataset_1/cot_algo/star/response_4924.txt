Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 3, 9
Node 1: 4, 7
Node 2: 3, 8
Node 3: 0, 2, 4
Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 7
Node 5: 4, 6
Node 6: 5, 9
Node 7: 1, 4
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 0, 6

Next, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1+4] = 5.

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (4, 5, 7)>
