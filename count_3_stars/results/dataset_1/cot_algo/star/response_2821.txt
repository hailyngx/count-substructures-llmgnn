Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {9}
Node 1: {6, 7}
Node 2: {7}
Node 3: {9}
Node 4: {6, 7}
Node 5: {8}
Node 6: {1, 4}
Node 7: {1, 2, 4}
Node 8: {5}
Node 9: {0, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

For node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 (since it has only 2 neighbors)
For node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0 (since it has only 2 neighbors)
For node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1

There is 1 3-star formed in this graph.
The unique 3-star is: <7, (1, 2, 4)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
