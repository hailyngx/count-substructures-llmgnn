Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {0}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 6}

Now we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 8} <0, (2, 4, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 5, 6} <1, (3, 5, 6)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 7, 8} <4, (6, 7, 8)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 8, 9} <6, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
