Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 5, 8).
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors (4, 5, 9).
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (4, 5, 9).
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 5, 6).
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 2, 4).
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors (8, 9, 4).
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 3, 9).
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 3, 7).

Counting the unique 3-stars and totaling them up:
Total number of 3-stars = 8, so we write it as [8].
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (8, 9, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
