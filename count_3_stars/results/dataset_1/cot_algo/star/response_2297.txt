Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48

So, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
