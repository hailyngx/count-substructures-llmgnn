Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [14]

List of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
