Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {6}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars (triangles) in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 5}. <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 6}. <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 3, 8}. <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 8}. <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 7, 8}. <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 4}. <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 7, 9}. <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 8, 9}. <7, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7, which is represented as [7].
