Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
  <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>,
  <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [(1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10)] = [23]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 8, 9)>.
