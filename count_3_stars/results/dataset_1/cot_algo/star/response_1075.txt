Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 3, 4
- Node 1: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7
- Node 5: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8

We will now identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 and Node 5 both have 4 neighbors, so they each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Putting it all together:
\[ [ 2 \times 4 ] = [ 8 ] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
