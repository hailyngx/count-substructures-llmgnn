Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graph representation for the given graph is as follows:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 1. <0, (3, 8, 1)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 8. <2, (5, 9, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 7. <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4. <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9. <8, (0, 4, 9)>

Since we have identified 5 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
