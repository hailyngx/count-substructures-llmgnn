Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 9. <1, (4, 8, 9)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 9. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 8. <4, (1, 3, 8)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 8. <6, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
