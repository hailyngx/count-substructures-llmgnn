Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the 3-stars for all nodes, we get a total of 32 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
