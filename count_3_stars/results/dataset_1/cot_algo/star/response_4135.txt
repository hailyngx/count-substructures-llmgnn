Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 1, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 7, 8
Node 3: 8, 9
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 6
Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8
Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 39

So, the final answer is [39], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, 4)>
