Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 3, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star: <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star: <5, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
