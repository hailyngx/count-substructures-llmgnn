Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 4, 5, 8

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 20, which is represented as [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
