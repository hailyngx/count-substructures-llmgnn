Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, we need to identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star

There are a total of 5 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5] with the unique 3-stars found as <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, and <8, (3, 5, 7)>.
