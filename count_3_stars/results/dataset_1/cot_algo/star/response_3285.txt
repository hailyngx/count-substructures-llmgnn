Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 2, 4 (degree 3)
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 5, 6, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 5, 7 (degree 3)
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 9 (degree 2)
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 2, 7 (degree 3)
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 9 (degree 2)
- Node 7: neighbors are 2, 5, 8, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 8: neighbors are 7, 9 (degree 2)
- Node 9: neighbors are 1, 4, 6, 7, 8 (degree 5)

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of them:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20

Inside brackets [], we have 20 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (8, 9, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 2)>, <9, (4, 7, 2)>, <9, (4, 6, 2)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>
