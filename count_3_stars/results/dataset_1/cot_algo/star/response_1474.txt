Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Since it has 4 neighbors, it can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars.
  <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 8>
  
- Node 1: Same as Node 0, it can form 4 3-stars.
  <1, 0, 3>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 7>
  
- Node 3: Same as Node 0 and Node 1, it can form 4 3-stars.
  <3, 0, 1>, <3, 0, 7>, <3, 1, 7>, <3, 1, 8>
  
- Node 2: Since it has 3 neighbors, it can form 3C3 = 1 3-star.
  <2, 5, 6>
  
- Node 5: Since it has 3 neighbors, it can form 3C3 = 1 3-star.
  <5, 8, 9>
  
- Node 8: Same as Node 2 and Node 5, it can form 1 3-star.
  <8, 5, 0>

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15, so we put [15] as the final answer.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 0, 7>, <3, 1, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <8, 5, 0>
