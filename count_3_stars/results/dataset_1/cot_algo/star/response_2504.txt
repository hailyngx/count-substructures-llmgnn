Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 3, 7

Next, we will determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 3 has 3 neighbors (2, 7, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [1], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (2, 7, 9)>.
