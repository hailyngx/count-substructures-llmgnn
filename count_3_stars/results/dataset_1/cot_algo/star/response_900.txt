Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {3, 4}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 18 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
