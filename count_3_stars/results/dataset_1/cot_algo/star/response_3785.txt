Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

In total, there are 4 + 4 + 10 = 18 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as:
<3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 6, 5)>, <4, (1, 6, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 6)>, <6, (2, 8, 6)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 6)>, <6, (4, 8, 6)>, <6, (7, 8, 6)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].
