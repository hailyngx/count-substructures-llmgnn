Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in an adjacency list format:

0: [3, 6, 8]
1: [2, 6, 7, 8]
2: [1, 8, 9]
3: [0, 4, 5, 7, 9]
4: [3]
5: [3, 6]
6: [0, 1, 5, 9]
7: [1, 3]
8: [0, 1, 2]
9: [2, 3, 6]

Now, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

0: [3, 6, 8]
1: [2, 6, 7, 8]
2: [1, 8, 9]
3: [0, 4, 5, 7, 9]
6: [0, 1, 5, 9]

Next, we will look at the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they can form:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 20

So, the final result is [20] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 9, 0)>
