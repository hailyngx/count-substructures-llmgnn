Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 4 + 10] = 24 \).

List of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 8, 9)>
- <9, (5, 8, 9)>
