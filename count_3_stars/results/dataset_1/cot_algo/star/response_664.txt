Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list all the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7} - can form 1 3-star
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5} - can form 1 3-star
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 7, 9} - can form 1 3-star
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 9} - can form 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
