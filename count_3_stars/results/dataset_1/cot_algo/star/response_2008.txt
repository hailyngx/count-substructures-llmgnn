Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars [] is 1.

The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (2, 3, 5)>
