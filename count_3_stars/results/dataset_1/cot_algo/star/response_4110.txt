Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 6, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Next, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [8] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <3, 2, 6>
- <6, 3, 7>
- <6, 5, 7>
- <6, 8, 9>
- <7, 9, 4>
- <7, 9, 8>
- <9, 4, 0>
