Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 2
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 7, and 1 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 9)>
