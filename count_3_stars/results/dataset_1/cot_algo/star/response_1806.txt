Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 4}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each node:

- Node 0: Does not form any 3-stars (only 2 neighbors).
- Node 1: Does not form any 3-stars (only 2 neighbors).
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3: Does not form any 3-stars (only 2 neighbors).
- Node 4: Does not form any 3-stars (only 2 neighbors).
- Node 5: Forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6: Does not form any 3-stars (only 2 neighbors).
- Node 7: Does not form any 3-stars (only 1 neighbor).
- Node 8: Does not form any 3-stars (only 1 neighbor).
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, and <9, (2, 3, 9)>.
