Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 5} -> <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 4, 8} -> <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 8} -> <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 8} -> <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 8, 9} -> <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 4} -> <8, (0, 2, 4)>
  
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars. So the final count is [6].
