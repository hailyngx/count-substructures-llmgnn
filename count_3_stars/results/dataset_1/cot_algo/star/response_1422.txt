Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 9 have 5 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 29

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 9, 0)>
- <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 0)>
- <6, (5, 7, 2)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
