Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: [8, 9]
- Node 1: [2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
- Node 2: [1, 5, 8]
- Node 3: [1, 7]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [2, 8]
- Node 6: [8, 9]
- Node 7: [1, 3, 9]
- Node 8: [0, 1, 2, 5, 6]
- Node 9: [0, 1, 6, 7]

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 + 4 = 25

Therefore, the final result is [25] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (1, 2, 3)>
- <1, (1, 2, 4)>
- <1, (1, 2, 7)>
- <1, (1, 3, 4)>
- <1, (1, 3, 7)>
- <1, (1, 7, 8)>
- <1, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (6, 7, 9)>
