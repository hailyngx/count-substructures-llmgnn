Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4}

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, 6. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, 9. <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 9, 3. <4, (5, 9, 3)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 8, 2. <6, (3, 8, 2)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, represented in brackets as [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 9, 3)>, and <6, (3, 8, 2)>.
