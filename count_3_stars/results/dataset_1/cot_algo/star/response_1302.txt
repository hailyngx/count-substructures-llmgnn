Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 0, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
