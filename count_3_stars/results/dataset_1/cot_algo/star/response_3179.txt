Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 2, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

Next, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, and Node 9 each have 4 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
