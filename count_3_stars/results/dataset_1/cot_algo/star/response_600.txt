Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(inom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 1: \(inom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 2: \(inom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 8: \(inom{5}{3}\) = 10
- Node 9: \(inom{5}{3}\) = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23]. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9), (0, 2, 9), (1, 2, 9), (1, 8, 9), (2, 1, 9), (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8), (1, 4, 5), (1, 5, 9), (1, 8, 2), (1, 8, 9), (2, 1, 8), (2, 5, 9), (2, 8, 9), (4, 5, 9), (5, 1, 9)>
