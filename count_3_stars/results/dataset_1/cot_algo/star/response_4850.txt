Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-star graph in the given graph, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 8}

Now, we'll check which nodes have three or more neighbors and can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9 have at least three neighbors.

For each node with at least three neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars it is part of:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 19 \) [19]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>
