Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 0, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by calculating the number of combinations for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 combination (0, 1, 4)
- Node 1: 1 combination (1, 3, 5)
- Node 3: 1 combination (3, 5, 6)
- Node 5: 1 combination (1, 3, 5)

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>
