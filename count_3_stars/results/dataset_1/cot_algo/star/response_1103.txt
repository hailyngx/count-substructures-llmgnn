Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1 neighbors: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2 neighbors: {4, 6}
- Node 3 neighbors: {4, 9}
- Node 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7 neighbors: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8 neighbors: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 9 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 6}

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, and 6 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to check for 3-stars involving these nodes:

- Node 0: 
    - <0, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 1: 
    - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 6: 
    - <6, (0, 1, 4)>
    - <6, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <6, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <6, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <6, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (4, 8, 9)>
    
We have found a total of 15 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
