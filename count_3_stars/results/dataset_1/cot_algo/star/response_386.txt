Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. 

For each node, let's find its neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4
- Node 9: 1, 7

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding them up: 35 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 39. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (1, 8, 4)>
- <0, (1, 8, 7)>
- <0, (1, 8, 5)>
- <0, (1, 8, 2)>
- <0, (1, 7, 2)>
- <0, (1, 7, 5)>
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (8, 4, 5)>
- <0, (8, 4, 7)>
- <0, (8, 7, 5)>
- <0, (4, 7, 5)>
- <0, (5, 2, 7)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (1, 8, 4)>
