Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we first need to find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 9}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>

Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars (similar to node 0).

Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<4, (2, 3, 8)>

Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars (similar to nodes 0 and 2).

Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars (similar to node 1).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 39. 
So, the final answer is [39] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>.
