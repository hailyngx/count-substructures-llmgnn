Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6
- Node 4: 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
