Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5
Node 1: 0, 5
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 0, 2
Node 4: 0, 7
Node 5: 0, 1, 8
Node 6: 7
Node 7: 4, 6, 8
Node 8: 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 1] = 6

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 1)>
<5, (1, 0, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
