Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3}
- Node 7: {3, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 4}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.

Next, we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 42, [42].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
