Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: (2, 9)
- Node 1: (3, 7, 9)
- Node 2: (0, 6)
- Node 3: (1, 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 5: (3, 6)
- Node 6: (2, 3, 5)
- Node 7: (1)
- Node 8: (3)
- Node 9: (0, 1, 3)

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 3: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 9: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13, and the unique 3-stars are:

<[1, 3, 9], [3, 6, 5], [3, 6, 2], [3, 6, 9], [3, 8, 5], [3, 8, 6], [3, 8, 9], [3, 5, 6], [3, 5, 9], [3, 9, 6], [3, 9, 5], [6, 3, 5], [9, 1, 3]>
