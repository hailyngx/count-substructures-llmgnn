Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<1, (0, 5, 7)>, 
<1, (0, 5, 9)>,
<1, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 9)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 6)>,
<5, (1, 6, 7)>,
<5, (3, 6, 7)>,
<5, (1, 6, 9)>,
<5, (3, 6, 9)>,
<5, (6, 7, 9)>,
<5, (1, 7, 9)>,
<5, (1, 7, 9)>,
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
