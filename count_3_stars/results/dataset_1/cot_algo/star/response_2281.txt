Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The adjacent nodes for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 7}

Node 0, 1, 4, and 7 have 4 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = \[38\]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
