Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 8, 9
Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
Node 2: 1, 6
Node 3: 1, 6, 8
Node 4: 1, 5, 9
Node 5: 4, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 8
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 0, 3, 6
Node 9: 0, 4, 5

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
