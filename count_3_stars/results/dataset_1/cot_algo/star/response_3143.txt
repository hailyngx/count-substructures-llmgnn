Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 5
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6
Node 2: 0, 4
Node 3: 1, 4, 5
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
Node 5: 0, 3, 4
Node 6: 1, 4, 9
Node 7: 8
Node 8: 7, 9
Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars for each of them:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13, so the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 0, 3, 5>
<4, 1, 2, 3>
<4, 1, 2, 5>
<4, 1, 3, 5>
<4, 2, 3, 5>
<4, 1, 3, 6>
<4, 2, 3, 6>
<4, 3, 5, 6>
<4, 1, 5, 6>
<4, 2, 5, 6>
<6, 1, 4, 9>
<8, 7, 9>
<8, 6, 9>
