Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 6

Now, let's check for each node that has three or more neighbors to see if any 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, no 3-star.
- Node 2: 2 neighbors, no 3-star.
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star: <5, (2, 7, 9)>.
- Node 7: 5 neighbors, can form 1 3-star: <7, (4, 5, 8)>.
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star: <9, (0, 6, 5)>.

Total number of 3-stars: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 5)>
