Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {6, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6, so the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (2, 4, 7)>
