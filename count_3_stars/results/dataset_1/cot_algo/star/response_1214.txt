Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 3, 7
Node 2: 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 3: 1
Node 4: 2, 9
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 0, 8
Node 7: 0, 1
Node 8: 2, 6
Node 9: 0, 2, 4

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: 1 (1 3-star)
Node 2: 1 (1 3-star)
Node 9: 1 (1 3-star)

Therefore, there are a total of [3] unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, 1, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 8>
