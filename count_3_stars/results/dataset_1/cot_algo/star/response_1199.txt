Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <2, (5, 7, 9)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 7
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 7)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 3)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 7
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <9, (2, 6, 7)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated, we have a total of [21].
