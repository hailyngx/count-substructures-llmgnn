Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph by listing the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2, 4}
Node 1: {6, 9}
Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 9}
Node 3: {4, 5, 6}
Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 8}
Node 5: {2, 3}
Node 6: {1, 3, 9}
Node 7: {8}
Node 8: {4, 7, 9}
Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( inom{n}{3} \) for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13, which we'll represent as [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 2)>
<9, (1, 6, 3)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 1)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [13] and the unique 3-stars are listed above.
