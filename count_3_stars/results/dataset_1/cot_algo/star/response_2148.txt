Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <2, (6, 9, 0)>
- Node 3 forms 2 3-stars as it has more than 3 neighbors: <3, (0, 6, 9)> and <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms 2 3-stars as it has more than 3 neighbors: <6, (0, 3, 4)> and <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 2 3-stars as it has more than 3 neighbors: <9, (0, 4, 7)> and <9, (2, 3, 8)>

Adding them up: [1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2] = [10]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10.
