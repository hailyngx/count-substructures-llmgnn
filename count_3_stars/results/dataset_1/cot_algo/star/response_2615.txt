Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4, 6, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 7 (4 neighbors)

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9 have 4 neighbors each, so each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [22], and the unique 3-stars found are:

1. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
3. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
4. <5, (1, 2, 4)>
5. <9, (0, 4, 5)>
