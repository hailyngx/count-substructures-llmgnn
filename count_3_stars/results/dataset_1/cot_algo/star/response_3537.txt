Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 3, 7
- Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 5, 8
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 8
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 3
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 9
- Node 7 has a neighbor: 0
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 2
- Node 9 has neighbors: 3, 6

Next, let's check which nodes have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 2 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 6: 2 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 10 = 12]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
