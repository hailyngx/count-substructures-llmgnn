Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6 (degree 4)
Node 1: 0, 4 (degree 2)
Node 2: 6, 7, 8, 9 (degree 4)
Node 3: 0, 7 (degree 2)
Node 4: 0, 1, 6 (degree 3)
Node 5: 6, 8 (degree 2)
Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (degree 7)
Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 8 (degree 4)
Node 8: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 (degree 5)
Node 9: 2, 6, 8 (degree 3)

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 35 + 10 = 53 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [53] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>.
