Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 3, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: Not applicable since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: Not applicable since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: Not applicable since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: Not applicable since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: Not applicable since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: Not applicable since it has less than 3 neighbors.

Adding up the number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, and <6, (0, 4, 5, 7, 8)>.
