Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Node 0 neighbors:} & \{2, 7, 9\} \\
\text{Node 1 neighbors:} & \{3, 7\} \\
\text{Node 2 neighbors:} & \{0, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \\
\text{Node 3 neighbors:} & \{1, 2\} \\
\text{Node 4 neighbors:} & \{2, 7\} \\
\text{Node 5 neighbors:} & \{2\} \\
\text{Node 6 neighbors:} & \{2, 9\} \\
\text{Node 7 neighbors:} & \{0, 1, 4\} \\
\text{Node 8 neighbors:} & \{\} \\
\text{Node 9 neighbors:} & \{0, 6\} \\
\end{align*}
\]

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 2 both have 3 or more neighbors, creating a 3-star with central nodes 0 and 2. This adds 1 to the total count.
- Total count: [1]

Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 7, 9)>
