Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 2: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10
- Node 6: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 9: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 4 + 10] = [28]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
