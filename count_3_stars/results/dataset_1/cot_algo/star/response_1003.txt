Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 19

So, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>
