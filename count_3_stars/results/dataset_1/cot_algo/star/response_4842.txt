Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Now, let's look at nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>
