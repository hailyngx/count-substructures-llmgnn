Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the 3-star graphs can be determined as follows:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {2, 6, 9}
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {2, 4, 8}
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {4, 6, 7, 9}
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {1, 3, 9}
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {2, 7, 9}
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 6}
Node 9 has 6 neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
