Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7

We can see that nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes.

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 9) = 7

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
