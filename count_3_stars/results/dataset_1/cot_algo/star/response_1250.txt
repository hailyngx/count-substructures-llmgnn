Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 6
Node 1: 0, 2, 8, 9
Node 2: 1, 3
Node 3: 2, 7
Node 4: 8
Node 6: 0, 7, 9
Node 7: 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 1, 4, 7
Node 9: 1, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
