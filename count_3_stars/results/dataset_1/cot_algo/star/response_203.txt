Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 9
- Node 1: 3, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 (as it has 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1 (as it has 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (as it has 5 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (as it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) (as it has 6 neighbors)

Now, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 36. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
