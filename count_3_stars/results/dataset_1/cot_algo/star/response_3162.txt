Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's define the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (7, 9, 0)>
<6, (7, 9, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (9, 0, 6)>
<7, (9, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
