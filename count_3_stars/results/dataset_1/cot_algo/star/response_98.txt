Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 cannot form a 3-star as it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 cannot form a 3-star as it has 3 neighbors, but they are not all connected to each other.
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 0.
- Node 7 can form three 3-stars: with nodes 0, 4, and 8 / 0, 2, and 8 / 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 3 + 1] = 6

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 6)>
- <8, (0, 4, 7)>
