Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 7, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 6: neighbor {3}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 7, 9}: <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 7, 9}: <3, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
