Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 4, 6 <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 2 does not form any 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 8, 9 <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 does not form any 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 7, 8 <5, (3, 7, 8)> and a 3-star with leaves 3, 7, 9 <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 does not form any 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7 does not form any 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8 does not form any 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9 does not form any 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 3, and the unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, and <5, (3, 7, 9)> which can be written as [3].
