Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Now, let's check for the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star: <5, (4, 7, 9)>
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star: <7, (0, 5, 8)>
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star: <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
