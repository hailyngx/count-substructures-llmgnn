Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {6, 9}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 7}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 8.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 2, 8, 9>
- <3, 6, 8, 9>
- <6, 3, 4, 8>
- <8, 0, 3, 6>
- <9, 0, 3, 4>
- <9, 0, 3, 7>
- <9, 3, 4, 7>
- <9, 6, 7, 4>
