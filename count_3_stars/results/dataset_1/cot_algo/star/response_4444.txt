Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 2, 6
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 5
- Node 3: neighbor is 6
- Node 4: neighbors are 1, 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: neighbor is 8
- Node 8: neighbors are 1, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: neighbors are 1, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 5, Node 9 form a 3-star with Node 1 as the center.
- Node 1, Node 8, Node 9 form a 3-star with Node 1 as the center.
- Node 5, Node 8, Node 9 form a 3-star with Node 5 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, and they are:
<1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9> 

Thus, the final answer is [3].
