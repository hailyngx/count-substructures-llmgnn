Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's look at the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13 \)

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].
