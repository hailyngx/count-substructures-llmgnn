Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 6

Now, let's identify the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 12.

Therefore, the final result is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
