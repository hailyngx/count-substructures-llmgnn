Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 8

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 1 = 21, which we will put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [21].
