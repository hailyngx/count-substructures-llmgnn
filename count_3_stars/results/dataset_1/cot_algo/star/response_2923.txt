Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
  - <1, (5, 7, 8)>

- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
  - <3, (2, 5, 8)>

As both nodes with 3 neighbors have formed 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars is 2, which we represent as [2].
