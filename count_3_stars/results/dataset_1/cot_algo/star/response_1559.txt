Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 3-stars = 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 1: 3-stars = 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 3: 3-stars = 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 4: 3-stars = 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 8: 3-stars = 5 choose 3 = 10
- Other nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the final result is [42] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (3, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>
