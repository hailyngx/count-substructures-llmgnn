Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
   1 -- 5
   |
   0 -- 2 -- 7
       | \  /|
       |  4-8
       | /  |
       6 -- 9
```

Now, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, and <7, (0, 4, 8)>.
