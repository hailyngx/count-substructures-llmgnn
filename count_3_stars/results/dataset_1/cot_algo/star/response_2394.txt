Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9. <0, (1, 2, 9)>
Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 9. <1, (0, 6, 9)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9. <2, (0, 3, 9)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9. <3, (0, 2, 9)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2. <6, (0, 1, 2)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 8. <7, (1, 3, 8)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2. <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 7, and they are <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>.
