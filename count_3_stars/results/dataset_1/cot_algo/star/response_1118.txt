Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 11, and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (3, 9, 2)>
