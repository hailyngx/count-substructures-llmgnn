Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor of node 0 is node 7.
- Node 1: Neighbors of node 1 are nodes 2, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 2: Neighbors of node 2 are nodes 1, 7.
- Node 3: Neighbor of node 3 is node 5.
- Node 4: Neighbors of node 4 are nodes 6, 8.
- Node 5: Neighbor of node 5 is node 3.
- Node 6: Neighbors of node 6 are nodes 1, 4.
- Node 7: Neighbors of node 7 are nodes 0, 1, 2.
- Node 8: Neighbors of node 8 are nodes 1, 4, 9.
- Node 9: Neighbor of node 9 is node 8.

Now, let's determine which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>.
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star, <8, (1, 4, 9)>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [5].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>.
