Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 9: 0

Now, we can see which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 and Node 4 have 4 neighbors each.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <2, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <2, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <2, (4, 6, 7)>

- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (1, 2, 6)>
  - <4, (1, 2, 7)>
  - <4, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <4, (2, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is 8. 
Thus, the final answer is [8] with the unique 3-stars being <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>.
