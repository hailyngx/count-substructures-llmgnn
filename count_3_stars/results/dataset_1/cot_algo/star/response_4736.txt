Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 8}
Node 2: {0, 4, 7}
Node 3: {1, 6, 7}
Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5}
Node 5: {0, 4, 7}
Node 6: {0, 3, 8, 9}
Node 7: {2, 3, 5}
Node 8: {1, 6}
Node 9: {6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 0 forms a 3-star ({1, 5, 6}), ({2, 4, 5}), and ({1, 4, 6}).
Node 1 forms a 3-star ({0, 4, 8}).
Node 4 forms a 3-star ({0, 1, 5}).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, and <1, (0, 4, 8)>.
