Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $ [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [12] $.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>.
