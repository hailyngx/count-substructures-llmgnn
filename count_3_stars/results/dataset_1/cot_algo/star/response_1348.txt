Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the neighborhood of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up gives a total of 19 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the answer is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
