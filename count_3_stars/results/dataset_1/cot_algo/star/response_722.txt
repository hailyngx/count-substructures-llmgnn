Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 5>
<7, 0, 4>
<8, 3, 9>
<9, 2, 3>
<9, 2, 4>
<9, 3, 4>
<9, 4, 8>

So, the final result is [7].
