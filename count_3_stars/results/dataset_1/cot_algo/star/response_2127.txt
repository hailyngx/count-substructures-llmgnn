Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the list of neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {7, 9}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {0, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {2, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: Forms 3 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = [1 + 1 + 1 + 3] = [6]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
