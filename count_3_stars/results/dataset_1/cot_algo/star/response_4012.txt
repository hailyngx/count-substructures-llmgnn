Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Now, we will find the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: None (2 neighbors only)
- Node 1: None (1 neighbor only)
- Node 2: None (1 neighbor only)
- Node 3: [1] <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 4: None (4 neighbors only)
- Node 5: None (2 neighbors only)
- Node 7: None (3 neighbors but not connected to form a 3-star)
- Node 8: None (1 neighbor only)
- Node 9: [1] <9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <3, (0, 4, 9)> and <9, (0, 3, 4)>.
