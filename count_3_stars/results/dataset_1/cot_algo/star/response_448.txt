Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 3), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 5), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 6), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are:
  <2, (0, 5, 6)>
  <2, (0, 4, 5)>
  <2, (4, 5, 6)>
  <2, (0, 4, 6)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 = 6]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>.
