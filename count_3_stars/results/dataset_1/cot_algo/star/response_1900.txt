Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 4}

Next, we'll identify the 3-star structures:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 forms two 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 6)> and <5, (1, 6, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [4]

Thus, the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, and <5, (1, 6, 8)>.
