Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors

Next, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 18 3-stars.

Now, we list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
