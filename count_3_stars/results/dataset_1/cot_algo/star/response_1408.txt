Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: (2, 4, 6, 7)
- Node 1: (2, 3, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 2: (0, 1, 7)
- Node 3: (1, 4, 5)
- Node 4: (0, 3, 5, 9)
- Node 5: (3, 4, 6, 8)
- Node 6: (0, 1, 5)
- Node 7: (0, 1, 2, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (1, 5, 7)
- Node 9: (4, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [32] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
