Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7}

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 9)>
<1, (4, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
