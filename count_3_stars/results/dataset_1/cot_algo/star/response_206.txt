Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 3, 7, 8

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:
- Node 1: 2 choose 3 = 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star

Adding these up: [0+4+4+4+1] = [13]

Finally, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
