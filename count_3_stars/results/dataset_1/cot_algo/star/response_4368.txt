Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph and list them, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 5, 7} <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 also forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 5} <7, (0, 1, 5)>

There are a total of 2 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final result is [2].
