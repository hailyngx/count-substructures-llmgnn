Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are: 
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7

Node 0, node 2, node 3, node 4, and node 5 have 5 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 
\[ [10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20] = [39] \]

So, there are a total of 39 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed inside <>:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
