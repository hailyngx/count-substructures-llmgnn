Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: No 3-stars formed (only 1 neighbor)
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars formed (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star formed
- Node 5: No 3-stars formed (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star formed
- Node 9: No 3-stars formed (only 2 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 = 2, so the answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
