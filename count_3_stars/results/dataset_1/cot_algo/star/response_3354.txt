Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Yes, 3-stars formed with neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: No (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: No (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: Yes, 3-stars formed with neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Yes, 3-stars formed with neighbors {0, 1, 6}, {0, 2, 7}
- Node 5: Yes, 3-stars formed with neighbors {1, 6, 8}, {1, 9, 5}
- Node 6: Yes, 3-stars formed with neighbors {3, 4, 8}, {3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: No (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: Yes, 3-stars formed with neighbors {0, 3, 5}, {0, 6, 4}, {3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Yes, 3-stars formed with neighbors {0, 3, 5}, {0, 6, 4}, {3, 5, 6}

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars:
4 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 3) + 2 (from node 4) + 2 (from node 5) + 2 (from node 6) + 3 (from node 8) + 3 (from node 9) = 17

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, 
<5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 9, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 6, 4)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 6, 4)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>
