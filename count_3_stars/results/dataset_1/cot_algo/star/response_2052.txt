Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph:

```
    0 - 8       2 - 5
        |       |
        4 - 9 - 6
```

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbor {2}
- Node 6: Neighbor {9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 6}

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 4, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of.

For node 0: C(2, 3) = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 4: C(2, 3) = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 8: C(2, 3) = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 9: C(2, 3) = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [0].

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph.
