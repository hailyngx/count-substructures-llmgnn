Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 8 each have 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star for each of these nodes.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors and can't form a 3-star.
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 have less than 3 neighbors and can't form a 3-star.
- Node 3 and Node 7 have 2 neighbors and can't form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
