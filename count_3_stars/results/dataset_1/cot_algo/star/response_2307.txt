Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4
- Node 1: 2, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2: 6 neighbors -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 6 neighbors -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 52. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<4, 2, 8>
<4, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 8, 5>
<8, 2, 3>
<8, 2, 4>
<8, 2, 5>
<8, 2, 7>
<8, 4, 5>
<8, 4, 7>
