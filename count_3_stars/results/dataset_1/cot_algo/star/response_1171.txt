Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6, 7

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>
