Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 7
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 8
- Node 6: Neighbor is 3
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: Neighbor is 5
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the final answer is [21] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>.
