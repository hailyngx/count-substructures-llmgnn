Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 7}

Now, let's check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars [] is 5.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
