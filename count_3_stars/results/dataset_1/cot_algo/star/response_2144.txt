Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
    1 --- 2 --- 3
    |   / |     |
    |  /  |     |
    | /   |     |
    6     4 --- 9
    |     
    5     
   
```

Now, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 1
- Node 9: 4

Next, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 1 + 1] = 3.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
