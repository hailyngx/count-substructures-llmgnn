Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 6, 7}

Next, we'll apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: No 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Given that there are 10 unique 3-stars, our final result in brackets is [10]. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (7, 5, 9)>
