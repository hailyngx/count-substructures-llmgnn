Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {4, 7}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 14.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
