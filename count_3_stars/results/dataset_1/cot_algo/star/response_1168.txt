Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7.
- Node 3 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 4 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 4, 7.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 5.
- Node 9 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

Given that the graph has 7 unique 3-stars, the final result is [] = 7.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 7)>
<2, (5, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
