Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4
- Node 9: 4, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 32

So, the final answer is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
