Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining the neighbor sets of each node that has three or more neighbors.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [33]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 2, 6)>
