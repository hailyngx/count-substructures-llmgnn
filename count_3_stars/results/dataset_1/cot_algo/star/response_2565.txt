Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <2, (4, 7, 5)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <3, (4, 9, 8)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
  <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars:
  <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, 
  <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>

Counting them all up, there are \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 26 \) 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [26].
