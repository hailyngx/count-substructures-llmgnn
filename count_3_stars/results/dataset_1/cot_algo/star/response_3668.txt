Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 7 have three or more neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
