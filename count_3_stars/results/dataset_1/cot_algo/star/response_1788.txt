Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3}
- Node 7: {1, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {5}

Next, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} = 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 = 18 \)

Finally, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18].
