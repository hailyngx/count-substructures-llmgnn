Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 3}
Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 2: {0, 1, 5}
Node 3: {0, 7}
Node 4: {8, 9}
Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 8}
Node 6: {1, 5}
Node 7: {1, 3, 9}
Node 8: {1, 4, 5}
Node 9: {4, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

Node 1: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
Node 5: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 8: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 = 22

So, the final result is [22] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
