Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 2}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 9} <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 5} <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 8} <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
