Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6

Now let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, which allows for \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, which allows for \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, which allows for \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 20 + 4] = [28] \), and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>,
<5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>,
<6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>
