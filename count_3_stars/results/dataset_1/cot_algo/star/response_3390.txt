Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {0, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 6}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. We will apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the number of 3-stars, we get a total of [1].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 9>
