Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's calculate how many 3-stars can be formed for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15, so [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
