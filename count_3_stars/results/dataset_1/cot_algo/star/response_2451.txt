Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}

Nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 28, which we represent as [28].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
1. <3, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <5, (0, 8, 9)>
3. <8, (1, 3, 6)>
4. <9, (0, 4, 7)>
