Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: 7, 9
Node 1: 4, 6, 8
Node 2: 
Node 3: 6
Node 4: 1, 9
Node 5: 7
Node 6: 1, 3
Node 7: 0, 5, 9
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 0, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0: 3 neighbors - Forms 1 3-star
<0, (7, 9)>

Node 1: 3 neighbors - Forms 1 3-star
<1, (4, 6, 8)>

Node 4: 2 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors - Forms 1 3-star
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [2]
