Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 6
Node 1: 2, 5, 9
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 8
Node 4: 7, 9
Node 5: 1, 6
Node 6: 0, 5
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 3, 9
Node 9: 1, 4, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2, which we represent inside brackets as [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
