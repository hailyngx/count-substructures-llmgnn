Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with neighbors (7, 8, 9) and (0, 8, 9) => [2]
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (7, 9) => [1]
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (6, 8, 9) => [1]
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (7, 8, 9) => [1]
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors (8, 9) => [1]
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors (6, 7, 9) => [1]
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors (6, 7, 8) => [1]

Total number of 3-stars: [8]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
