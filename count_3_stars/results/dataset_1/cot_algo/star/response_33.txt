Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbor 7
Node 1: Neighbors 2, 4
Node 2: Neighbors 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 3: Neighbors 2, 5, 7, 9
Node 4: Neighbors 1, 8
Node 5: Neighbor 3
Node 6: Neighbors 2, 9
Node 7: Neighbors 0, 3
Node 8: Neighbors 2, 4, 9
Node 9: Neighbors 2, 3, 6, 8

Now, we can determine the 3-stars:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 6: <2, (1, 3, 6)>

Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
1 3-star is found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
