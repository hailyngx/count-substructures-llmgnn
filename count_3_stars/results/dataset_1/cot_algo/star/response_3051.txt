Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 8 (1 3-star)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 8 (1 3-star)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 9 (4 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 = 6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <3, (0, 3, 9)>
- <3, (2, 3, 6)>
- <3, (3, 6, 9)>
