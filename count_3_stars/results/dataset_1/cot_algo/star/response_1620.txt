Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph you described is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to all other nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9).
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.

Now, let's find the 3-star structures in this graph:
- Node 6 has 9 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{9}{3} = 84 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 84 + 4 = 88, which can be written as [88].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
