Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4} => 1 3-star
- Node 3: {2, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {7, 9}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5} => 1 3-star
- Node 9: {3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 8 each have one 3-star, so we have a total of 2 3-stars.

Therefore, the final result is [2] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 2, 4)> and <8, (1, 8, 5)>.
