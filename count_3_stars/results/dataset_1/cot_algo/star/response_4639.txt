Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
Node 1: {0, 5, 9}
Node 2: {4, 5}
Node 3: {0, 6}
Node 4: {2, 6}
Node 5: {1, 2, 8}
Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 7}
Node 7: {0, 6, 8}
Node 8: {0, 5, 7, 9}
Node 9: {1, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{8} \binom{n}{3} \]

Calculating this sum, where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for the respective node:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 11 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 8, 0)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
