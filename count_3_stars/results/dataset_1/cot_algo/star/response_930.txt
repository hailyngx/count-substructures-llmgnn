Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 5, 6
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 2, 4
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 8
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 8
Node 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 4, 5
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Node 9 neighbors: 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors
Node 1 has 3 neighbors
Node 2 has 4 neighbors
Node 3 has 4 neighbors
Node 4 has 5 neighbors
Node 5 has 6 neighbors
Node 6 has 5 neighbors
Node 8 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 1: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the final answer is [60], and the unique 3-stars formed are:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
