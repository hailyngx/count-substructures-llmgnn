Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <4, (5, 7, 0)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <5, (7, 9, 4)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
   The 4 unique 3-stars are: <7, (5, 1, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
   The 10 unique 3-stars are: <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 4)>, <9, (7, 5, 6)>, <9, (7, 6, 8)>, <9, (7, 6, 1)>, <9, (2, 6, 5)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 17, so the final result is [17].
