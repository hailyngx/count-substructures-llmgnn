Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22\)

Thus, the final answer is [22] with the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
