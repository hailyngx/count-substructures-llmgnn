Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 3: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Total 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 = 9]

List of unique 3-stars:
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (7, 5, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 6)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- <8, (0, 6, 3)>
- <8, (2, 6, 3)>
