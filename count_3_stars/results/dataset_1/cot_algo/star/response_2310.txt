Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 8)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 9)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (nodes 2, 4)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 7)
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (node 8)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (nodes 4, 9)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (nodes 0, 6)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (nodes 2, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( [1+1] = [2] \)

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
