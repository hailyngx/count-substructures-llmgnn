Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {0, 1}

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( [4+4+4] = [12] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>.
