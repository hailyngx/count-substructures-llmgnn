Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 8

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 and Node 2 have 3 neighbors each.
- Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each.

For nodes with 3 neighbors (Node 1 and Node 2), there is only 1 3-star formed with each:
- <1, 7, 8>
- <2, 0, 6>

For nodes with 4 neighbors (Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9), we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \):
- <3, 5, 7>
- <6, 2, 5>
- <7, 1, 2>
- <9, 0, 3>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 2) + 4 (from nodes with 4 neighbors) = 6. 
Hence, the final answer is [6].
