Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 6 have 4 neighbors each, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, Node 4, and Node 8 have 6 neighbors each, so they can each form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 68

Therefore, the final result is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
