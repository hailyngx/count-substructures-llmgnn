Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 1, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's check which nodes have at least three neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 5, and Node 6 each have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 10 = 12.

Therefore, the final answer is [12] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
