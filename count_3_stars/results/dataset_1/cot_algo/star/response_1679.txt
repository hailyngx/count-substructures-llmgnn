Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {2}

Now, we'll check for how many 3-stars are formed:
- Node 0: 0 3-star
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 8: 0 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 8 [ <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>]
