Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 6, 8).
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 5).
- Node 8 forms two 3-stars: one with nodes (1, 6, 9) and another with nodes (2, 7, 9).

The total number of 3-stars is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 6, 8), 2, (1, 4, 5), 8, (1, 6, 9), (2, 7, 9)>.
