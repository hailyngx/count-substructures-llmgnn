Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 9)>
  
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
