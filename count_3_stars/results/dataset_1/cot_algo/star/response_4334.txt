Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the provided information, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: (1, 4)
Node 1: (0, 4, 6, 8)
Node 2: (3, 7, 8, 9)
Node 3: (2, 7, 9)
Node 4: (0, 1, 6, 8, 9)
Node 5: 9
Node 6: (1, 4, 9)
Node 7: (2, 3)
Node 8: (1, 2, 4, 9)
Node 9: (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8)

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
