Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 5
Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 8
Node 2: 0, 4
Node 3: 1, 4, 8
Node 4: 2, 3, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 8, 9
Node 6: 1
Node 7: 9
Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 9
Node 9: 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 14 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 9, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, and <9, (5, 8, 7)>.
