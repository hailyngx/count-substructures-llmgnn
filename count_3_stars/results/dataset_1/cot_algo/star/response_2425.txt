Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 9)
Node 1: 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 4, 7)
Node 2: 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 7)
Node 3: 3 neighbors (Nodes 6, 7, 9)
Node 4: 4 neighbors (Nodes 1, 6, 7, 9)
Node 5: 2 neighbors (Nodes 6, 8)
Node 6: 4 neighbors (Nodes 3, 4, 5, 7)
Node 7: 6 neighbors (Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
Node 8: 2 neighbors (Nodes 5, 9)
Node 9: 4 neighbors (Nodes 0, 3, 4, 8)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 7)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (6, 7, 9)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (6, 7, 9)

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have [3].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
