Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 3, 5
Node 1: 7
Node 2: 0, 6, 8
Node 3: 0, 5, 8, 9
Node 4: 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 3
Node 6: 2, 4
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 2, 3, 4
Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in this graph:

[7]
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 4)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
