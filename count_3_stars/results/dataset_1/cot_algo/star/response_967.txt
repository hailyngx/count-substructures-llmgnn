Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node. 

Node 0: 2, 7
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 2, 8
Node 6: 2, 8
Node 7: 0
Node 8: 5, 6

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 6: 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7, hence [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, _)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 8, _)>
<6, (2, 8, _)>
