Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {5}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 7}

Now, let's identify the number of 3-stars and the unique 3-stars:

- Node 0: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 1: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 2: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 3: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. Unique 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 4: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 5: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. Unique 3-star: <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 6: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. Unique 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 7: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 8: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 9: Does not have 3 or more neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = [3]

Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>
