Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
With the given graph, we can determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 9}
Node 1: {2}
Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 9}
Node 3: {0, 7}
Node 4: {0, 2}
Node 5: {8, 9}
Node 6: {0, 2, 7, 8, 9}
Node 7: {3, 6}
Node 8: {5, 6, 9}
Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 6, 8}

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [28]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
