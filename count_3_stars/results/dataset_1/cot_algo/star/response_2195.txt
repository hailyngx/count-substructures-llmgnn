Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (0, 5, 6) and (5, 6, 7).
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (1, 4, 6), (1, 5, 6), and (4, 5, 6).
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (2, 3, 8) and (3, 6, 8).
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 5, and they are:
<[0, 5, 6], [5, 6, 7], [1, 4, 6], [1, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]>
