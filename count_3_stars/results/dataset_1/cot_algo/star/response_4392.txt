Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 2}
- Node 6: {2, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: Node 2 has only 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 3: Node 3 has only 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 10 + 4] = [18] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>
