Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 = 11, which we'll represent as [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7, 2)>
