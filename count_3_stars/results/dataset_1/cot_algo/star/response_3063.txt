Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, and <9, (1, 3, 8)>.
