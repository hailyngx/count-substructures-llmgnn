Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 6

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 12.

The unique 3-stars are:
<[2, 5, 6], [2, 5, 8], [2, 6, 8], [2, 7, 8], [6, 3, 9], [6, 8, 9], [6, 2, 9], [6, 3, 9], [9, 0, 1], [9, 0, 3], [9, 1, 3], [9, 1, 6]>
