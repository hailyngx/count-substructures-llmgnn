Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 6

Next, identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 = 24

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars (ignoring duplicates) inside <>:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)> 

So, the final answer is [24].
