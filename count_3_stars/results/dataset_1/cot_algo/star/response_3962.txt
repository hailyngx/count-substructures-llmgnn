Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [19] \)

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 8, 5)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 6, 2)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
