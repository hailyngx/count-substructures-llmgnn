Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
\( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, there are total of 10 3-stars [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
