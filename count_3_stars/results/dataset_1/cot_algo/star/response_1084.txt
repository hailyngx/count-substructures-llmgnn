Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 5}
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 7}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
Node 3: Neighbors {2}
Node 4: Neighbors {0, 7}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}
Node 6: Neighbors {2, 7}
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
Node 9: Neighbors {2}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

For node 0: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( C(2, 3) = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( C(2, 3) = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( C(2, 3) = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we have a total of 32 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [32] with the unique 3-stars represented as follows: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>.
