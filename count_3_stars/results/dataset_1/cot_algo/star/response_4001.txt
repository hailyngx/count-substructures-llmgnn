Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 8
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 0, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 1, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 5)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (6, 7, 9)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 5)> and <1, (6, 7, 9)>.
