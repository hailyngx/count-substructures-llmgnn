Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we can first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 1 has neighbors: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2 has neighbors: {5, 8}
- Node 3 has neighbors: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4 has neighbors: {7}
- Node 5 has neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6 has neighbors: {1}
- Node 7 has neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8 has neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 9 has neighbors: {7}

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 8) = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>.
