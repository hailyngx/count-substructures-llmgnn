Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {0, 5}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (1, 2, 5).
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (0, 5, 3).
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (0, 2, 7).
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (3, 4, 9).

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4, which can be represented as [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>.
