Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a more structured way. 

The graph has 10 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The edges are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1 is connected to node 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 is connected to node 0
- Node 7 is connected to node 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph by following the method described earlier. 

Node 0 has neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8}, so it can form 4 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>
Node 2 has neighbors {0, 3, 4}, so it can form 1 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 4)>
Node 3 has neighbors {2, 4, 9}, so it can form 1 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 9)>
Node 4 has neighbors {0, 2, 3}, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 3)>
Node 5 has neighbors {7, 8, 9}, so it can form 1 3-star: <5, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 8.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
