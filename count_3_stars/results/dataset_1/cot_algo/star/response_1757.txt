Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-stars (3 or more neighbors required)
- Node 1: No 3-stars (3 or more neighbors required)
- Node 2: No 3-stars (3 or more neighbors required)
- Node 3: One 3-star <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 4: Two 3-stars <4, (3, 5, 9)> and <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: No 3-stars (3 or more neighbors required)
- Node 6: One 3-star <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: No 3-stars (3 or more neighbors required)
- Node 8: No 3-stars (3 or more neighbors required)
- Node 9: No 3-stars (3 or more neighbors required)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, and they are:
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>

Thus, the final result is [4].
