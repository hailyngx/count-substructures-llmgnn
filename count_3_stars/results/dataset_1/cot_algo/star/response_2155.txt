Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 0, 7, 9
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 
\[ [20 + 20 + 10 + 4] = [54] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 54.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (2, 3, 5)>
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>
