Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7

Now, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28 3-stars in the graph. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 9, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 9, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
