Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 7

Next, we identify which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the final result is [14] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<1, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<1, (0, 5, 9)>,
<1, (0, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<2, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<2, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
