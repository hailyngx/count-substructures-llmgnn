Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, 7, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 1] = 9 \)

List of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (7, 6, 2)>
- <0, (7, 6, 3)>
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <7, (2, 0, 8)>
- <7, (8, 0, 4)>
- <8, (0, 4, 7)>
