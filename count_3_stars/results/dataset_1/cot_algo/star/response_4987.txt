Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0 neighbors: 7
- Node 1 neighbors: 4, 6
- Node 2 neighbors: 3, 4, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 2, 4
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 7, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9 neighbors: 2, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Finally, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 22, which we will denote as [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
