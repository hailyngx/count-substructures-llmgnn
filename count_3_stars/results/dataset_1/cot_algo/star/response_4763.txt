Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 2: It has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 6)>, <2, (1, 8, 6)>, <2, (7, 8, 6)>
- Node 5: It has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (7, 8, 1)>, <5, (7, 8, 2)>, <5, (1, 8, 2)>, <5, (7, 1, 2)>
- Node 8: It has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 5)>, <8, (2, 9, 5)>, <8, (7, 9, 5)>

Adding these up, we have a total of 16 3-stars in this graph: [16]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>,  
<2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 6)>, <2, (1, 8, 6)>, <2, (7, 8, 6)>,  
<5, (7, 8, 1)>, <5, (7, 8, 2)>, <5, (1, 8, 2)>, <5, (7, 1, 2)>,  
<8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 5)>, <8, (2, 9, 5)>, <8, (7, 9, 5)>.
