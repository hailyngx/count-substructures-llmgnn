Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph and their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6
- Node 4: 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 7, 8)> and <6, (3, 7, 8)>.
