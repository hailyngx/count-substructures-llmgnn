Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will first determine the 3-star structures present in the graph.

Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7
Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 4, 7
Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 9
Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 8
Node 5 has neighbors: 6, 9
Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 5, 8
Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 2
Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 6
Node 9 has neighbors: 3, 5

By looking at the neighbor sets of each node, we can see that the only node that has three or more neighbors is Node 1. This node forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
