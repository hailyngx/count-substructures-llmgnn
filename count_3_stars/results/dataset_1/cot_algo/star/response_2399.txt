Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6 (3 neighbors)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 = 6], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (0, 2, 6)>
