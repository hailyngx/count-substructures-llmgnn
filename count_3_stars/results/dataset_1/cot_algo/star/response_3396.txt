Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:
```
  1 --- 2 --- 9
  |     |   / |
  |     |  /  |
  5 --- 8 /   7
          |
          4 -- 6
```

Let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 9
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4, which we'll represent as [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 7, 8)>
