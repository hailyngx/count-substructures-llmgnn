Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. The 3-stars are <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. The 3-star is <9, (2, 3, 8)>.

In total, there are 5 3-stars in this graph, so the final number inside brackets is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, and <9, (2, 3, 8)>.
