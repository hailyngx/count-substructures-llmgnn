Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, and 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 8, and 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0 and 7
- Node 3: Neighbors are 5 and 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 3 and 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 8 and 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2 and 3
- Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 5, and 6
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, and 6

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars using these nodes. 

For node 0:
  - Neighbors are 1, 2, and 9
  - Total possible 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 9)>

For node 1:
  - Neighbors are 0, 8, and 9
  - Total possible 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 8, 9)>

For node 9:
  - Neighbors are 0, 1, and 6
  - Total possible 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, and <9, (0, 1, 6)>.
