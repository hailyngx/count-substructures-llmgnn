Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5
- Node 3: 1, 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to check for potential 3-stars:
- Node 0, 5 neighbors 
- Node 4, 4 neighbors 
- Node 6, 3 neighbors 
- Node 9, 3 neighbors 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [14]

Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>
