Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 0)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
