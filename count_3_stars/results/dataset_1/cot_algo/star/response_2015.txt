Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 2, 5)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 2, 5)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 1, 7)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 4, 7)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 1, 7)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 2, 3)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
