Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: neighbors are 4, 9
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: neighbors are 2, 6, 7
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 6
- Node 6: neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: neighbors are 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: neighbors are 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: neighbors are 2, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 4, so we have [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<6, 0, 5>
<8, 9, 2>
