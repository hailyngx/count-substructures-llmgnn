Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 4, 7}

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 4] = 14 \)

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
