Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: 0 3-star
- Node 8: 0 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1

So, there is 1 unique 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 8)>
