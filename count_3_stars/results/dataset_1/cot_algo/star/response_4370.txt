Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 7}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 3: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 5: Forms 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 7: Forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: Forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 9: Does not form a 3-star

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
