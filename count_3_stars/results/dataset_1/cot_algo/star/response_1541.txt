Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 23, which we will list as [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (2, 3, 9)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- <9, (2, 6, 9)>
- <9, (2, 7, 8)>
- <9, (2, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 8, 9)>
