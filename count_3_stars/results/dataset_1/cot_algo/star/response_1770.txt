Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood for each node: 

- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 4}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 1: 3-star formed with neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: 3-star formed with neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: 3-star formed with neighbors {2, 5, 6}

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
