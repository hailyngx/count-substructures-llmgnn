Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can construct the following graph:

```
0 --- 4      6
 \           |
  \          |
    \        |
      3 --- 6
       \   /|
        \ / |
         4  |
         |  |
         8  2
         | / 
         |/  
         1   
         |
         7
         |
         5 --- 9
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Therefore, it forms 10 3-stars: <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 7)>, <2, (1, 9, 7)>, <2, (7, 8, 1)>.

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, and 8. Therefore, it forms 4 3-stars: <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 7)>, <2, (1, 9, 7)>, <2, (7, 8, 1)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>.
