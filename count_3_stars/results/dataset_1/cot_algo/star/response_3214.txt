Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4: 3 neighbors, only one 3-star can be formed. <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, only one 3-star can be formed. <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- Remaining nodes have less than 3 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the answer is [6].
