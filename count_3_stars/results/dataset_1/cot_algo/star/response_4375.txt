Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there are [1] 3-star(s) with Node 0 as the center.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are [4 choose 3 = 4] 3-star(s) with Node 1 as the center.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so there are [6 choose 3 = 20] 3-star(s) with Node 2 as the center.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are [4 choose 3 = 4] 3-star(s) with Node 4 as the center.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are [4 choose 3 = 4] 3-star(s) with Node 5 as the center.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there are [1] 3-star(s) with Node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 34.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>
