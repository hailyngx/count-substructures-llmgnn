Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There are a total of 12 3-stars in this graph. 

Thus, the final answer is: [12]
The unique 3-stars are: <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 7)>
