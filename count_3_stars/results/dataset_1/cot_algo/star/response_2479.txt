Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1 and 2
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0 and 6
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 3, and 4
- Node 3: Neighbor is 2
- Node 4: Neighbors are 2, 7, and 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1 and 8
- Node 7: Neighbor is 4
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4 and 6

Nodes 5 and 9 do not have any neighbors based on the given edges.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: Only 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 1: Only 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed.
- Node 4: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed.
- Node 6: Only 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 8: Only 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Therefore, we have a total of 2 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars formed are:
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>

So, the final answer is [2], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 3, 4)> and <4, (2, 7, 8)>.
