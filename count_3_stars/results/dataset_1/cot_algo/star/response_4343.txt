Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
   0 -- 3
   |   / \
   |  /   \
   | /     5 -- 9
   7       |    |
           |    6
           |   /
           8 - 
           |
           1
```

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: neighbors are 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: neighbor is 8
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 1, 5
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 9
- Node 7: neighbor is 0
- Node 8: neighbors are 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: neighbors are 1, 5, 6

Now, we see that nodes 1 and 5 each have 5 neighbors, which means they can form 10 total 3-stars combined. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
