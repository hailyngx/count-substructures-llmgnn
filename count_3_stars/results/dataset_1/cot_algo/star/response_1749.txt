Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 17
So, the total number of 3-stars is [17].

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
