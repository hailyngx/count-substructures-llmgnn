Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 3: Doesn't have 3 neighbors, so no 3-star
- Node 4: Doesn't have 3 neighbors, so no 3-star
- Node 6: Doesn't have 3 neighbors, so no 3-star

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [1]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-star found in this graph is <0, (4, 6, 9)>.
