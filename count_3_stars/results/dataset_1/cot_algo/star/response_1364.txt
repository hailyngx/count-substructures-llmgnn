Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 3, 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 4, 5
- Node 7 neighbors: 3, 8
- Node 8 neighbors: 4, 7
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5

Next, we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Total 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28

Therefore, the final result is [28] and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
