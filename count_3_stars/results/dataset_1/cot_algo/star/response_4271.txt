Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed from each node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [20] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- <4, (3, 8, 6)>
- <6, (2, 3, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
