Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 5
Node 1: 5, 6
Node 2: 6, 7
Node 3: 4, 5, 6
Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 3
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4
Node 7: 2, 8
Node 8: 4, 7
Node 9: 4

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ inom{3}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{4}{3} = 1 + 10 + 4 = 15 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

Finally, we will list the unique 3-stars found:

<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
