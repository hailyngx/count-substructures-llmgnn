Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 7)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 6, 8)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (nodes 3, 4)
- Node 3: 6 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 8)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 8, 9)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (nodes 1, 2)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 9)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (nodes 5, 7, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 3, and Node 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate for them.
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 20 + 10 = 31

Therefore, the final answer is [31] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
