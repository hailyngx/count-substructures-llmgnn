Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {6}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 5)>, <5, (3, 7, 5)>, and <6, (0, 2, 4)>.
