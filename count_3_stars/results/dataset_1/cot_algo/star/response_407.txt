Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: 6

Next, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 4, 6>
- <3, 1, 5>
- <7, 1, 2>
- <7, 1, 3>
- <7, 2, 3>
- <7, 0, 1>

So, the final answer is [6].
