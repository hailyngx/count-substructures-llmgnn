Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {5}

Now let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: The neighbor set has 2 nodes, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 1: The neighbor set has 2 nodes, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2: Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
    - <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 3: The neighbor set has 2 nodes, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4: The neighbor set has 1 node, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5: Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
    - <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 6: The neighbor set has 2 nodes, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7: The neighbor set has 1 node, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8: Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
    - <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 9: The neighbor set has 1 node, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, and <8, (0, 2, 3)>.
