Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find all the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, 9 <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 8 <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 6 <9, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 9 forms another 3-star with nodes 1, 6, 8 <9, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 9 forms yet another 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 8 <9, (0, 1, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have [5].
