Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 8, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11

So, the total number of 3-stars is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (8, 0, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>
