Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 1

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 4)>, <2, (8, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>
