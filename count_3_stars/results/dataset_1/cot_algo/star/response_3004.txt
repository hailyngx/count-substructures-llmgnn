Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 1, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \([4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [20]\)

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
