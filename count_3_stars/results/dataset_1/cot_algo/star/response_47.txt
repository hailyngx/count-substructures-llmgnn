Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {1, 7}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 9: {0, 5}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph, and the total number of 3-stars is 0, which we represent as [0].
