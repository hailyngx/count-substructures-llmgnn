Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 7

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each applicable node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 1 + 4] = 9 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (5, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 4)>, <4, (2, 9, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>
