Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can analyze the graph to find the 3-star structures.

The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star
  - <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 1: Has 4 neighbors, forms 4 3-stars
  - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
  - <1, (0, 4, 7)>
  - <1, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <1, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 2: Has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star
  - <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 4: Has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star
  - <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 6: Has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star
  - <6, (5, 7, 8)>
  
Adding them up, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
