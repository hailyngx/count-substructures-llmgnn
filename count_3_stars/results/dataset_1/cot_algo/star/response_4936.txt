Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 6}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- For node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of [1 + 4 = 5] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
