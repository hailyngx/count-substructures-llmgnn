Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 1: 4, 5, 8
Node 2: 3, 4
Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 7
Node 4: 0, 1, 2
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 3, 7
Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 8
Node 8: 1, 7
Node 9: 0

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star with leaves 3, 4, 7: <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star with leaves 0, 6, 7: <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star with leaves 0, 1, 2: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star with leaves 0, 3, 6: <7, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
