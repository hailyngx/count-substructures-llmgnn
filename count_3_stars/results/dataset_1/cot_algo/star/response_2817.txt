Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3}  
Node 1: {3}  
Node 2: {4, 7, 8}  
Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 9}  
Node 4: {2, 3, 7}  
Node 6: {8}  
Node 7: {2, 4, 8}  
Node 8: {2, 6, 7}  
Node 9: {3}  

Based on the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8  

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:  
<2, (4, 7, 8)>  
<3, (0, 1, 4)>  
<4, (2, 3, 7)>  
<7, (2, 4, 8)>  
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
