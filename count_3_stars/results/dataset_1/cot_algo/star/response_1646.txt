Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 26 \), which we will represent as [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 9)>
