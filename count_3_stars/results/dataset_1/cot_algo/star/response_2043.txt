Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 8}

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 8, and 6 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate how many 3-stars can be formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13

So, the final answer is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 0)>, <8, (9, 0, 3)>, <8, (9, 0, 7)>, <8, (9, 3, 5)>, <8, (9, 6, 7)>, <8, (9, 7, 0)>
