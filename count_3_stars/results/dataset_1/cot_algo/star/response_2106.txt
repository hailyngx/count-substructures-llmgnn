Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1] = 32. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 6, 7)>, 
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, 
<0, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<0, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<0, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<2, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<2, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (6, 9, 7)>, 
<6, (9, 7, 4)>.
