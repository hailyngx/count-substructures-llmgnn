Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: \( 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 \) [18]

Unique 3-stars:
