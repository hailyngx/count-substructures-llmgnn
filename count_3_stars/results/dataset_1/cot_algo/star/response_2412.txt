Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following structure:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 1.
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 0, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 3, 7, 8, and 9. It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
  These 3-stars are <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>.
- Node 2 has neighbors 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9. It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
  These 3-stars are <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9}>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 10 = 20]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>.
