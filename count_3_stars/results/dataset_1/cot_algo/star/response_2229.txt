Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 5}

Now, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [23] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
