Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: [3]
Node 1: [2, 4, 6, 9]
Node 2: [1, 8]
Node 3: [0, 4, 5, 7]
Node 4: [1, 3, 8]
Node 5: [3]
Node 6: [1, 7, 8, 9]
Node 7: [3, 6, 9]
Node 8: [2, 4, 6, 9]
Node 9: [1, 6, 7, 8]

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 22

So, the final answer is [22] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
