Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6, 9
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 3 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <3, (5, 6, 4)>
- Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <6, (7, 9, 4)>
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11, which can be represented as [11].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 4)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 4)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>.
