Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 6}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {0, 2}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {5, 6}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 = 11. 
So, the final result is [11] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 5, 8)>, and <5, (0, 6, 7, 8, 9)>.
