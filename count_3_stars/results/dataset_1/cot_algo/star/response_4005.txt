Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor set = {7}
- Node 1: Neighbor set = {5}
- Node 2: Neighbor set = {3, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbor set = {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor set = {7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbor set = {1, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbor set = {2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor set = {0, 3, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbor set = {2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbor set = {3, 4, 6}

Next, we will determine the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2, 4, 6, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.
    - Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4: [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
