Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
Given the edge list, we can generate the neighborhood sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {3, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 6}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 6}
- Node 2 and Node 3 both have 4 neighbors, so they each form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 3, 8}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 2*(4) + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
