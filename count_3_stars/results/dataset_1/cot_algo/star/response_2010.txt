Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will find the 3-stars in this graph.

Let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 2
- Node 6: 1, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 7: <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, 6: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, 7: <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, 8: <6, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
