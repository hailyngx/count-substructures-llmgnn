Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

Now, let's apply the combinatorial calculation to nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are a total of 9 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<4, 0, 5>
<7, 1, 5>
<8, 0, 4>
<8, 0, 7>
<8, 3, 4>
<8, 4, 7>
<9, 0, 1> 

Thus, the final answer is [9].
