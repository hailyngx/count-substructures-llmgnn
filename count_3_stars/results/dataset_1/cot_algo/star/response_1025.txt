Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5
- Node 8: 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star by applying the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, thus it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15

So, the total number of 3-stars is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
