Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 1, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
- <9, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 7, 9)>
