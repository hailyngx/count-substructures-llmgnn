Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 3, 6

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26

So, the final answer is [26] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
