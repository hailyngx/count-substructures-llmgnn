Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors [5, 6, 8, 9]
- Node 1: neighbors [2, 7]
- Node 2: neighbor [1]
- Node 3: neighbor [8]
- Node 4: neighbor [5]
- Node 5: neighbors [0, 4]
- Node 6: neighbor [0]
- Node 7: neighbors [1, 9]
- Node 8: neighbors [0, 3, 9]
- Node 9: neighbors [0, 7, 8]

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula mentioned in the problem statement.

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 1 = 6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <0, (8, 9, 5)>
- <0, (9, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 9, 5)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
