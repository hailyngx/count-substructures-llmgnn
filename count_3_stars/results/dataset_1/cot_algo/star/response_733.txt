Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, here are the steps to find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 5, 8
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 8
3. Node 2 has 1 neighbor: 4
4. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 9, 5
5. Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 5
6. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 8
7. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 8
8. Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9
9. Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 4, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 20] = [47]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>
