Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 4 + 4 = 9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
