Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Now, let's check for the formation of 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3-stars.
- Node 8: has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 20 (from node 8) = 21
So, the final answer is [21].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 6)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 6)>
- <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 6)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
