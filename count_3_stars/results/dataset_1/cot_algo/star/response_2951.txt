Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7, 8

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 58

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 58, which can be represented as [58].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>

These are the unique 3-stars present in the graph.
