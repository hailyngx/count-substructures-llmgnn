Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up:
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 42

Therefore, the final answer, inside brackets, is [42].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 5, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (8, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>
