Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {0, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 35

Therefore, we found a total of 35 3-stars in the graph:
[35]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>
