Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 16

So, the total number of 3-stars is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 7, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
