Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph as follows:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 3, 9
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 5
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 8
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 9
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 1, 3
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 1, 7
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 7, 8
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 2, 6
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 7

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
