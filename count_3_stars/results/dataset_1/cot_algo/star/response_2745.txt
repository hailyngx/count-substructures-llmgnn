Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1] = 20

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (2, 3, 5)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, and <8, (0, 2, 9)>.
