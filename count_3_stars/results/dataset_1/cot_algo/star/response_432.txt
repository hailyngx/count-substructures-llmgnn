Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 0, 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2: can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4: can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5: can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9: can form 1 3-star.

Since each of these nodes can form one 3-star, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, and <9, (0, 2, 8)>.
