Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: 0, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 8
- Node 3: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, can form a 3-star.
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, can form a 3-star.
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors, can form a 3-star.
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors, can form a 3-star.
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors, can form a 3-star.
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors, can form a 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <1, 0, 5>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 8, 9>
- <5, 0, 7>
- <8, 2, 3>
- <8, 2, 9>
- <8, 3, 9>
- <8, 6, 9>
- <9, 1, 3>
