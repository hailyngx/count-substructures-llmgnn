Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 4 and Node 7 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form 10 different 3-stars each.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 different 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \text{Total} = 10 + 10 + 4 = 24 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars inside brackets is [24].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
