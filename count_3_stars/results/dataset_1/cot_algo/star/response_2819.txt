Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4}

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 22

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [22]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 9>
