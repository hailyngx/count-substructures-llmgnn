Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed is \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 11 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <3, (5, 1, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
