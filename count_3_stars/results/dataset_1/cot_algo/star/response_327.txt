Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format:

0: 6, 7, 9
1: 3, 7
2: 7, 8
3: 1
6: 0, 7
7: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
8: 2, 7
9: 0, 7

Now, let's calculate the neighbors for each node:

Neighbors:
0: 6, 7, 9
1: 3, 7
2: 7, 8
3: 1
6: 0, 7
7: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
8: 2, 7
9: 0, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (6, 7, 9)> and <7, (0, 6, 9)>.
