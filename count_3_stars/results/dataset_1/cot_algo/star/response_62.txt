Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of possible 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 39

Therefore, the final answer is [39] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>.
