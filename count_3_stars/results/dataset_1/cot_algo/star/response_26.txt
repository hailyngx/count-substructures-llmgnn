Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5

Now, we can calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10, which we represent as [10].
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>.
