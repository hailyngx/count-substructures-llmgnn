Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Now, we will check each node to see if it can form any 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [10 + 20] = 30 \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
