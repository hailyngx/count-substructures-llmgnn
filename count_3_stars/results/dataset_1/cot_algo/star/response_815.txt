Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors in the given graph are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 5, 9  
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7  
Node 2: 4, 6, 7, 9  
Node 3: 1, 6, 8, 9  
Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 7  
Node 5: 0, 9  
Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 7, 9  
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8  
Node 8: 3, 7  
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \({0 \choose 3} = 0\)  
Node 1: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)  
Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)  
Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)  
Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)  
Node 6: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)  
Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)  
Node 9: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)  

Total number of 3-stars: \(0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 46\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46], and the unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (0, 3, 4)>  
<1, (0, 3, 7)>  
<1, (0, 4, 7)>  
<1, (3, 4, 7)>  
<2, (4, 6, 7)>  
<2, (4, 6, 9)>  
<2, (6, 7, 9)>  
<3, (4, 6, 7)>  
<3, (6, 7, 9)>  
<4, (6, 7, 9)>  
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
