Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 5, 9.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 3, 8.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 2.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 7, 9.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 6, 9.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 5, 8.
- Node 7: Neighbor is 4.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 6.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: <9, (1, 4, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
