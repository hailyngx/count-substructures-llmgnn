Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
    0 --- 8     6 --- 9
     \     \   /     /
      9 --- 0 --- 8
       \     |     |
        1--- 3 --- 4
             |   \
             2 -- 5 --- 7
```

Now, we will list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4
- Node 9: 0, 6

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing up the number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (2, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
