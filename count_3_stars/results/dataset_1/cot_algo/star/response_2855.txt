Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 (5 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0, 6, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 (6 neighbors)
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8 (3 neighbors)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64], and the unique 3-stars are:
