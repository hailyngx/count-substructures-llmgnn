Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {0, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [28]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
