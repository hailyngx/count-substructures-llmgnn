Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 38 edges, let's first identify the neighbor nodes of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms 15 3-stars: 
    - <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, 
    - <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, 
    - <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 4 forms 6 3-stars:
    - <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (8, 6, 9)>, <4, (9, 6, 8)>

- Node 8 forms 1 3-star:
    - <8, (2, 4, 6)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15 + 6 + 1] = 22. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>,
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>,
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>,
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (8, 6, 9)>, <4, (9, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>
