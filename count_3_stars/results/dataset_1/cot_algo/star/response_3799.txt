Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 8), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 7), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1+4] = 5.
