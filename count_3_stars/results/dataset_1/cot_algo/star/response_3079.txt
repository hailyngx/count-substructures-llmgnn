Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3

Nodes 1, 3, and 8 each have three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [21]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 1)>
<9, (1, 3, 0)>
