Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [20 + 1 + 10] = 31 \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 4, 9)>
- <0, (6, 4, 9)>
- <0, (7, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (3, 5, 7)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
