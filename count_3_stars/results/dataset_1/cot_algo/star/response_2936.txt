Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors are 2 and 5
- Node 1: neighbor is 5
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 3, 6, and 9
- Node 3: neighbors are 2, 4, 6, and 9
- Node 4: neighbors are 3, 5, and 7
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 8, and 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 2, 3, and 9
- Node 7: neighbor is 4
- Node 8: neighbor is 5
- Node 9: neighbors are 2, 3, 5, and 6

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 6, 9
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, 9
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 8, 9

There are 3 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, and <5, (4, 8, 9)>.
