Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 3: 7
- Node 5: 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- All other nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
