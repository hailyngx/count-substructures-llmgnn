Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7
- Node 6: 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 8

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star

There are a total of 6 3-stars in this graph. 
Thus, the final answer is [6], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
