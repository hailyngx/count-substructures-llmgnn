Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there are \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so there are \({{6}\choose{3}} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars.

Adding them up: \(1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 39\) [39]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>
