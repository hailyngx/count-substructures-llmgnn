Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor nodes for each of the 10 nodes:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 forms no 3-stars as it doesn't have three or more neighbors.
- Node 2 forms no 3-stars as it doesn't have three or more neighbors.
- Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 5)> and <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 forms no 3-stars as it doesn't have three or more neighbors.
- Node 7 forms two 3-stars: <7, (0, 3, 9)> and <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 8 forms no 3-stars as it doesn't have three or more neighbors.
- Node 9 forms no 3-stars as it doesn't have three or more neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, and <7, (0, 4, 9)>.
