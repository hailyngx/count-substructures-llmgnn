Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbor nodes {2}
- Node 1: neighbor nodes {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: neighbor nodes {0, 1}
- Node 3: neighbor nodes {6, 9}
- Node 4: neighbor nodes {7, 8}
- Node 5: neighbor nodes {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: neighbor nodes {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: neighbor nodes {4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: neighbor nodes {1, 4, 7}
- Node 9: neighbor nodes {3, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
