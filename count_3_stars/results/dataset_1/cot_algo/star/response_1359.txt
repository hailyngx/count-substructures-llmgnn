Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 3}

Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form. 

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
