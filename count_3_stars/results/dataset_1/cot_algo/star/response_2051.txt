Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 4, 5: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, 6: <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, 4: <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 5, 7: <6, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>.
