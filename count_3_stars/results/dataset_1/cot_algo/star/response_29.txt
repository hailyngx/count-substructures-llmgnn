Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 1, 2
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 1, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 1, and 3 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
