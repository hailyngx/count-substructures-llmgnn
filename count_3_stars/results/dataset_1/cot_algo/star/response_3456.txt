Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 8

Next, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 9, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
