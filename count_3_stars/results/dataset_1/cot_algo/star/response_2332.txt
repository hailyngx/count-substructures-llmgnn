Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 0, 2

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors : 1 combination
- Node 1: 4 neighbors : 1 combination
- Node 2: 5 neighbors : 10 combinations
- Node 4: 5 neighbors : 10 combinations
- Node 6: 5 neighbors : 10 combinations

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
