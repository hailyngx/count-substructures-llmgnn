Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 1, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 0, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 23, which we put inside brackets: [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>
- <9, (2, 7, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
