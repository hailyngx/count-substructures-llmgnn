Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 1: {3, 4}
Node 2: {4, 8}
Node 3: {1, 8}
Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
Node 5: {0, 4}
Node 6: {0}
Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
Node 9: {0, 4, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [24].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
