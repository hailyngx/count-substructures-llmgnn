Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4
- Node 9: 2, 3

Next, we can identify the 3-stars based on the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, 8: <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 6, 8: <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 4, 7: <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, 4: <8, (0, 3, 4)>

Since each of these nodes forms a unique 3-star, the total number of 3-stars [] is 4.
