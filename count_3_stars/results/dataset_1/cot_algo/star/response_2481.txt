Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5}

Now, we will look for 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 4 have 4 neighbors each, so for each of them, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations. This gives us a total of 8 3-stars between Node 2 and Node 4.
- Node 9 also has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8 + 1] = [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
