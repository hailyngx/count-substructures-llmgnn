Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 0, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 and Node 1 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 1 = 9, so the total number of 3-stars is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 9, 8)>
