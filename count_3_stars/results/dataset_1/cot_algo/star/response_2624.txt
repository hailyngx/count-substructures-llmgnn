Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 8.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 5, 7, 8.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 3, 6.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 2, 4, 6, 8.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 8.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 8, 9.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 3, 8.
- Node 7: Neighbor is 1.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Node 9: Neighbor is 5.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, which results in [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars involving node 1 are <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>.

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, which results in [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars involving node 3 are <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>.

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, which results in 1 3-star.
  - The 3-star involving node 5 is <5, (1, 8, 9)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 1] = 9, so the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>.
