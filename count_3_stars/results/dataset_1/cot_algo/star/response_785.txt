Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {2}
Node 1: {2, 3, 8}
Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 6}
Node 4: {7, 8}
Node 5: {2, 3}
Node 6: {2, 3}
Node 7: {2, 4, 9}
Node 8: {1, 4, 9}
Node 9: {7, 8}

Next, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 28 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 2)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 4)>
