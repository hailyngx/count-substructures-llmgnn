Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 5, 9
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 7, 9. <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 9, 0. <4, (6, 9, 0)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, 9. <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 6. <9, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, we have a total of 4 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [4].
