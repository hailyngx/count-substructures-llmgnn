Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 2: has 6 neighbors, so \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
