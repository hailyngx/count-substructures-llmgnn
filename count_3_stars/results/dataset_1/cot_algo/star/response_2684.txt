Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 9}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, hence \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 12.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
