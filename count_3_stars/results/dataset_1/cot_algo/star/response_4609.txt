Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {0, 3}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7}

Next, let's find the 3-stars in this graph.
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 6, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
