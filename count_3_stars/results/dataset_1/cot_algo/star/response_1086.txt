Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 8}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 8}

Now, we look for nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>

<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
