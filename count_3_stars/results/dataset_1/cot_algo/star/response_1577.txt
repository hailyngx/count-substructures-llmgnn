Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 6, and Node 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 10 3-stars each.
- Node 2, Node 4, and Node 5 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [33] \]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
