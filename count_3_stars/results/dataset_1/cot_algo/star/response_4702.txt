Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are five nodes with at least 3 neighbors: nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's find the 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 3, 4, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (3, 4, 8)>

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3}  = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>

For node 7:
- Neighbors: 0, 3
- Number of 3-stars: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.

For node 8:
- Neighbors: 3, 5, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16.

Putting this number inside brackets, we get the final result as [16].
