Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: Yes, 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: No
- Node 2: No
- Node 3: No
- Node 4: Yes, 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: Yes, 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: No
- Node 7: Yes, 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: No
- Node 9: No

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
