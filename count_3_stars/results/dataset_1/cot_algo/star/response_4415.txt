Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will first determine the 3-star configurations in the graph.

For each node, we will identify its neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: Neighbor is 4
- Node 4: Neighbors are 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 6, 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: Neighbor is 5
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 8

Next, we will count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (1, 2, 5)
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (0, 1, 9)
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (3, 6, 8)
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (5, 4, 8)
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (4, 6, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 4, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>.
