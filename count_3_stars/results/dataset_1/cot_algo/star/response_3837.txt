Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to first determine the neighbor set for each node. 

The neighbor set for each node is as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars from the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Summing up the contributions, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>.
