Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 3-star count = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 2: 3-star count = C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 3: 3-star count = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 4: 3-star count = C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 5: 3-star count = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 9: 3-star count = C(4, 3) = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 36.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 2, 3, 4>
<2, 0, 3, 6>
<2, 0, 3, 7>
<2, 0, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 5, 9>
<4, 3, 5, 8>
<5, 3, 4, 8>
<5, 4, 8, 9>
<9, 0, 5, 6>
<9, 2, 5, 6> 

The final result is [36].
