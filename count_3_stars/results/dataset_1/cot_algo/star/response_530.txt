Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 6
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 6
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 9

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 3 in total: [3].
Listing the unique 3-stars found, we have: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, and <6, (1, 5, 9)>.
