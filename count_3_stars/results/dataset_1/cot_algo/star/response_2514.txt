Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's first determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 3 and 6
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 4, and 5
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1 and 3
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4, and 6
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 3, 5, and 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 4, and 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 3, and 8
- Node 7: Neighbor is 5
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4 and 6

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, and <6, (0, 3, 8)>.
