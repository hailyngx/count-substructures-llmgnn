Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we first need to list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 8}

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 7)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
  <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
  <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, 
  <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, 
  <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
  <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, 
  <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, 
  <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 9, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 29, which we can represent as [29]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 9, 9)>
