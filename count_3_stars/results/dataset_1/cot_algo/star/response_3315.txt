Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
  - <0, (3, 6, 7)>
  - <0, (3, 6, 8)>
  - <0, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <0, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 1: Not a part of any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 2: Not a part of any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
  - <3, (0, 2, 5)>
  - <3, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <3, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <3, (0, 2, 8)>

- Node 4: Not a part of any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 5: Not a part of any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 6: Not a part of any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 7: Not a part of any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
  - <8, (0, 3, 5)>
  - <8, (0, 1, 5)>
  - <8, (0, 3, 1)>
  - <8, (1, 3, 5)>

- Node 9: Not a part of any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the final result is: [12], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, 
<8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 1)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>
