Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2
Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 2: 0, 3, 7
Node 3: 2, 5, 7, 9
Node 4: 1, 6, 9
Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 9
Node 6: 1, 4, 5
Node 7: 2, 3, 8
Node 8: 7
Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 5

Now, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>,
<3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 9, 9)>, 
<4, (6, 5, 9)>, 
<5, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>
