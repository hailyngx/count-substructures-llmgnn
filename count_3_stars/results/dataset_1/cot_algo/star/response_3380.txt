Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate how many 3-stars are formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is 10+1+4+4+1+1 = 21.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
