Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {2, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 15.

Therefore, the final answer is [15], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
