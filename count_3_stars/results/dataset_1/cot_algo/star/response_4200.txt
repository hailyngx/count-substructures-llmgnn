Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 6)> and <3, (8, 9, 2)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (2, 3, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have [5].
