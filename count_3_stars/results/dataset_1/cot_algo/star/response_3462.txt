Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 5}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

So, there are a total of [1 + 4 + 10] = 15 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
