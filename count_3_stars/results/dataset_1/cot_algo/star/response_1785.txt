Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 5: 1, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-star graphs:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

So, the final result is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
