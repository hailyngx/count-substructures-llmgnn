Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 8

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 8)>
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 6, 8)>
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 6)>
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: 
<6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (4, 3, 8)>
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars: 
<8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, 
<8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, 
<6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>,
<6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
