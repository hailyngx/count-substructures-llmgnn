Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives \([10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [56]\).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
