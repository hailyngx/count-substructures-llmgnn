Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 7

Now, let's check for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2: 6 neighbors, can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- Node 4: 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 = 24.

Therefore, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (0, 4, 2)>
- <9, (4, 7, 2)>
- <9, (2, 7, 4)>
