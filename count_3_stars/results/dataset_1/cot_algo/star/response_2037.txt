Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbor {4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbor {9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (7, 9, 3)>
