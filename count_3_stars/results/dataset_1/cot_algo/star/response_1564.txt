Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining the nodes and their neighbors:

Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 1 has neighbors: 7
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9
Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 5, 9
Node 4 has neighbors: 9
Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 3, 8
Node 6 has neighbors: 0
Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 2, 8
Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 5, 7
Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 8, 9
Number of 3-stars with 3 neighbors = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
