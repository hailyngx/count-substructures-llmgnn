Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 9: {2}

Now, we will check for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors -> No 3-stars
- Node 2: 3 neighbors -> No 3-stars
- Node 3: 2 neighbors -> No 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 neighbors -> No 3-stars
- Node 5: 2 neighbors -> No 3-stars
- Node 6: 2 neighbors -> No 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors -> No 3-stars
- Node 8: 2 neighbors -> No 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 neighbor -> No 3-stars

In total, there are 20 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 0, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 8)>
<7, (8, 0, 1)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
