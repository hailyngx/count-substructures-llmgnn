Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Firstly, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: {3, 9}
- Node 1: {8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 6}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 5}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

For Node 4: There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>

For Node 5: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>

For Node 9: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (0, 1, 7)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9, which can be represented as [9].
