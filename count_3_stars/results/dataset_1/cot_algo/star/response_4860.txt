Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 1, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed (2 neighbors)
- Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 9)> (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed (2 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed (1 neighbor)
- Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 9)> (3 neighbors)
- Node 5: <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)> (4 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed (1 neighbor)
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed (1 neighbor)
- Node 9: <9, (1, 4, 5)> (3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>.
