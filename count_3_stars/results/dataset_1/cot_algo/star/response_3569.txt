Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <1, (3, 5, 7)> <1, (5, 6, 9)> <1, (5, 7, 9)> <1, (3, 7, 5)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <5, (1, 6, 9)> <5, (1, 7, 9)> <5, (6, 7, 9)> <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 10.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 5)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
