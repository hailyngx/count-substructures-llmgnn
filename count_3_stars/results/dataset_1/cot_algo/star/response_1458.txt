Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph data provided, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph by examining the neighbors of each node. 

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbor {7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbor {7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 4}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 1}.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 9}.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2}.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 4), 4, (0, 1), 7, (1, 9), 9, (1, 2)>.
