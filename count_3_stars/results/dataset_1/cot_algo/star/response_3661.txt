Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1 + 1 + 20] = 32.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- <8, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 8)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 8)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 8)>
- <8, (2, 6, 8)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
