Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
