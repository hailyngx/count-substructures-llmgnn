Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 3, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 4, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 6, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: Neighbor is 4
- Node 6: Neighbor is 3
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 7

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 9, and Node 4 have 3 or more neighbors so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>.
