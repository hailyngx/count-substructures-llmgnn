Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4
- Node 6: 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 28.

Therefore, the final answer is [28] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
