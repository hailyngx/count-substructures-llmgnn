Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 7, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, and <7, (2, 4, 8)>.
