Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars formed in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbor {8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 6, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of [14] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
