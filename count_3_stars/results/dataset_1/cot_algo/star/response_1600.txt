Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2}
- Node 4: {6, 9}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars: 
- Node 2 forms a 3-star <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star <4, (6, 9, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
