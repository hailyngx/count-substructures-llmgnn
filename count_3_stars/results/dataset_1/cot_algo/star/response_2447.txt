Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 7, 9
Node 1: 3, 6, 9
Node 2: 6
Node 3: 1, 7
Node 6: 1, 2
Node 7: 0, 3
Node 9: 0, 1

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 1 and Node 9 both have 3 neighbors, so we have 2 * (3 choose 3) = 2 possible 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 9)>
