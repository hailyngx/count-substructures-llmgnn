Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars [] is 4. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
