Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 8
Node 1: 6
Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 4
Node 4: 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 4, 6
Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 2, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 6, 9. This gives <2, (5, 6, 9)>.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 7, 8. This gives <4, (5, 7, 8)>.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 7, 8. This gives <6, (5, 7, 8)>.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 6, 9. This gives <8, (4, 6, 9)>.

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of 4, so the final answer is [4].
