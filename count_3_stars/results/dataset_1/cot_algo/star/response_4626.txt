Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 1, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 7

Now, we'll check for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 7: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16 = [16]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (1, 4, 9)>
- <1, (1, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
