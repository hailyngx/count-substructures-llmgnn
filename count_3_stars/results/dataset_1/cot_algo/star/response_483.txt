Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for node 0
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for node 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (6, 8, 7)>
