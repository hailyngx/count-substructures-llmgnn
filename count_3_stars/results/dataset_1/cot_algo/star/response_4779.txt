Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {0, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {0, 2}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Node 0, Node 2, and Node 3. 
For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1] = [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 8)>
