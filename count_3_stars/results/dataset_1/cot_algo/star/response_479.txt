Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors: <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star since it has 5 neighbors: <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star since it has 4 neighbors: <8, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
