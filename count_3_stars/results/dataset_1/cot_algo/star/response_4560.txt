Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we can determine the 3-star graph by finding all nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. 

The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, we'll find the 3-star graphs:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <4, (1, 2, 8)> and <5, (3, 6, 9)>.
