Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms 3 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 3 + 1] = 6.
