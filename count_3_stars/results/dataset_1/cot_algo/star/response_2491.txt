Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: neighbors {6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 1: neighbors {3, 5, 6}
Node 2: neighbor {7}
Node 3: neighbors {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
Node 4: neighbors {3, 9}
Node 5: neighbor {1}
Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7}
Node 7: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6}
Node 8: neighbor {0}
Node 9: neighbors {0, 3, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph based on the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (6, 7, 8)>
Node 1 does not form any 3-star (has only 3 neighbors)
Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 6, 9)>
Node 6 does not form any 3-star (has only 4 neighbors)
Node 7 does not form any 3-star (has only 4 neighbors)
Node 9 does not form any 3-star (has only 3 neighbors)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (6, 7, 8)> and <3, (1, 6, 9)>.
