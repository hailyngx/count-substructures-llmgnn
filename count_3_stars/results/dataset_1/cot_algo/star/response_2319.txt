Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors are 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: neighbors are 8, 9
- Node 2: neighbor is 0
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 9
- Node 4: neighbor is 8
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 6
- Node 6: neighbor is 5
- Node 8: neighbors are 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: neighbors are 1, 3, 8

Next, we will check for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to see if they form 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 3, 5.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 9, 1.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 8, 1.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2, and they are: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (4, 9, 1)>.
