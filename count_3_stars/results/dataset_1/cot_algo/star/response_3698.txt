Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 

1. For node 0:
   Neighbors: {5, 6, 7, 8}
   Number of 3-stars: [1]
   Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>

2. For node 2:
   Neighbors: {5, 6, 8}
   Number of 3-stars: [1]
   Unique 3-stars: <2, (5, 6, 8)>

3. For node 4:
   Neighbors: {9}
   Number of 3-stars: [0]

4. For node 5:
   Neighbors: {0, 2}
   Number of 3-stars: [0]

5. For node 6:
   Neighbors: {0, 2}
   Number of 3-stars: [0]

6. For node 7:
   Neighbors: {0, 8, 9}
   Number of 3-stars: [1]
   Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 8, 9)>

7. For node 8:
   Neighbors: {0, 2, 7, 9}
   Number of 3-stars: [1]
   Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 7, 9)>

8. For node 9:
   Neighbors: {4, 7, 8}
   Number of 3-stars: [1]
   Unique 3-stars: <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>
