Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are denoted as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's first list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 9}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {0, 3}

Since nodes 0, 5, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star because it has exactly 3 neighbors: [1]
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star because it has exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars because it has 4 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, which we enclose in brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
