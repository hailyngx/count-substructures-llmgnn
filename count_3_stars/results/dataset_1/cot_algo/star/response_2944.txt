Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form a 3-star because it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 can form a 3-star because it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 can form a 3-star because it has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the final result is [12] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
