Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 1: 6, 9
Node 2: 5, 6
Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 4, 6
Node 8: 5, 6
Node 9: 1, 4, 5

Next, let's identify 3-stars:

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars involving node 4 are: <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>.

Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars involving node 5 are: <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 5, 9)>.

Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars involving node 6 are: <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 7)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 10 = 24. So, the final count is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 7)>.
