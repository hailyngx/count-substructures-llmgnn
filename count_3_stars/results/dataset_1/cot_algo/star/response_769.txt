Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 9
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 9
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 9
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 8
Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5
Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 9
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 4, 5
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 38 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (6, 8, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 1)>
<9, (5, 7, 2)>
<9, (5, 7, 3)>
