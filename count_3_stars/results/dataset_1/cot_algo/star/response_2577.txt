Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7, 8

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

For nodes with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>.
