Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 7}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [11] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>
