Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 8
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 8 each have three neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<3, 2, 5>
<8, 7, 9>
