Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so 1 combination.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so 1 combination.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) combinations.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) combinations.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 16

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
