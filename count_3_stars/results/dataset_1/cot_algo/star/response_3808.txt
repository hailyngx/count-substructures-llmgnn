Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars in this graph. The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, and 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the final result, inside brackets, is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
