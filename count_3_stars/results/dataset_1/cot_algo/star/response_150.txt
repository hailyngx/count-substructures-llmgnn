Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2

Next, we will identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Counting the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>
