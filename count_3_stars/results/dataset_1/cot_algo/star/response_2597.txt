Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 6, 7

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6
So, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>.
