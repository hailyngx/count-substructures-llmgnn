Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {2, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {1, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 3}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6. 

The unique 3-stars are:

<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
