Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 2: 0, 8, 9 (degree 3)
- Node 3: 4, 5 (degree 2)
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 7 (degree 4)
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8 (degree 3)
- Node 7: 4, 5 (degree 2)
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6 (degree 3)
- Node 9: 2, 4 (degree 2)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0, with 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  - <0, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <0, (2, 4, 8)>
  - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <0, (4, 6, 8)>
  
- Node 4, with 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
  - <4, (0, 3, 5)>
  - <4, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <4, (0, 5, 7)>
  - <4, (3, 5, 7)>
  - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 5, 9)>
  - <4, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (0, 5, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10] = 14.
