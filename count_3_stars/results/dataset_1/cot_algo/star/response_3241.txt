Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>.
