Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we will first calculate the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}

We see that nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 9>

So, the final result is [7].
