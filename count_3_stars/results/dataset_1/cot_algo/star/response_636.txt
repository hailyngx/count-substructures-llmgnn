Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbor {4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3}

Now, let's check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 0 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 8, 9: <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, 8: <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 3, 5: <8, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, and <8, (1, 3, 5)>.
