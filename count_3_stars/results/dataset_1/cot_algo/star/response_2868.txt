Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 5)
- Node 1: No neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 6, 7)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 7, 8)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (nodes 7, 8)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 6, 8)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 4)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (node 6)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [11].
