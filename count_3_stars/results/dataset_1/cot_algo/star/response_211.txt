Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2 3-stars (1)
- Node 7, 1 3-star (1)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (6, 9, 7)> and <7, (0, 4, 5)>.
