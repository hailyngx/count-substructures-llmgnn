Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 8}
- Node 1: {}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {0, 6}
- Node 9: {5}

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [0 choose 3] = 0
- Node 1: [1 choose 3] = 0
- Node 2: [1 choose 3] = 0
- Node 3: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 4: [2 choose 3] = 0
- Node 5: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 6: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 7: [1 choose 3] = 0
- Node 8: [2 choose 3] = 0
- Node 9: [1 choose 3] = 0

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0] = 9

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)> 

Thus, the final answer is [9].
