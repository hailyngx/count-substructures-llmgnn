Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbor nodes {4}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes {3, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes {6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes {1, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes {0}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes {3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes {5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes {2}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes {2, 6}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 8, 9} <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars with neighbors {1, 2, 7} <6, (1, 2, 7)> and {5, 7, 9} <6, (5, 7, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph.
