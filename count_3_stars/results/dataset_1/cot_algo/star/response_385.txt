Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
Node 0 and Node 1 have 4 neighbors each, so they form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars each.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 1] = [9].

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 1)>
