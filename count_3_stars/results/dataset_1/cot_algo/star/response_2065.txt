Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 7

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors:
  - 6 nodes * 1 3-star each = 6 3-stars
- For nodes with 4 neighbors:
  - 4 nodes * \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each = 16 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \(6 + 16 = 22\).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (5, 9, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>

So, the final answer is [22].
