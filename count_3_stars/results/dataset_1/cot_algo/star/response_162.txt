Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually for better understanding:

```
     0 --- 5        8
     |      |       |
     |      |       |
     7 --- 4 --- 1 --- 8
          |       |   |
          |       |   |
          3 --- 2 --- 9
                  |
                  |
                  6
```

Next, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7, and 9: <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, and 8: <5, (4, 7, 8)>

There are 2 unique 3-stars found in the graph, so the final answer is [2].
