Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 1: neighbor {5}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 7: neighbor {2}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [4+1] = [5]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
