Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 0, 2
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 4, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19

So, there are 19 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 3, 4, 5)>
