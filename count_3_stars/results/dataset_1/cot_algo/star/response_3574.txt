Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 2)>

In total, there are 4 + 1 = 5 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [5].
