Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Counting the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [4 + 4 + 1] = [9] \]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
