Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 7 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed, resulting in <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star can be formed, resulting in <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- For Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars can be formed (as there are 6 neighbors), but noting that some will be duplicates, so we need to list them out: 
    - Listing out all possible combinations (ignoring duplicates): 
        - <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, 
        - <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, 
        - <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, 
        - <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, 
        - <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, 
        - <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, 
        - <4, (5, 6, 9)>, 
        - <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>,    
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed, resulting in <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>

Summing this up, we have a total of [4 + 1 + 20 + 4] = 29 3-stars in this graph.
