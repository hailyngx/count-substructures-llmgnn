Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
