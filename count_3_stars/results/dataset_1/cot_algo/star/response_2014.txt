Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {2, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 3}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each node is part of:
- Node 0: 0
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0

There are a total of 2 unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 6)>, and <6, (1, 3, 4)>.
So, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
