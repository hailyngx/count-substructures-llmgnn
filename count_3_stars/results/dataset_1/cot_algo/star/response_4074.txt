Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
