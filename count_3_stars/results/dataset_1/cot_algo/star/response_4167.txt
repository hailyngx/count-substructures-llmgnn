Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4

Now, we can see that nodes 2 and 4 both have 4 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 8, and they are:
<[2, 1, 4], [2, 1, 7], [2, 4, 7], [2, 7, 9], [4, 0, 2], [4, 0, 9], [4, 2, 9], [7, 2, 9]>
