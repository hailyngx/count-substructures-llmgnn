Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: 2, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 and Node 4 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 1, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 7 have 3 neighbors.

For nodes with 4 neighbors (Node 2 and Node 4), we calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) as each set of 3 neighbors forms a unique 3-star.
For nodes with 3 neighbors (Node 1, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 7), we have 1 3-star for each of them.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [8]\).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (7, 8, 1)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
