Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 6
Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 8
Node 2: 0, 5
Node 3: 0, 1, 5
Node 4: 1, 6, 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 6: 0, 4, 9
Node 7: 4, 5
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least three neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 20] = [32]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
