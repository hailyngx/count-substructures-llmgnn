Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Next, we will identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 8

Now, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 35

Therefore, we have a total of 35 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 9, 4)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
