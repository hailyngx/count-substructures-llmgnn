Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4
- Node 9: 1, 5

Next, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential centers of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form only 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors
- Node 8 can form only 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors

So, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16, which we put inside brackets: [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
