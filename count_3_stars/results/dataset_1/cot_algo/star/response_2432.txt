Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To begin, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4}

Now, let's identify which nodes form 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with (2, 4, 5), (4, 5, 6), and (5, 6, 7). Total: 3
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with (4, 5, 9). Total: 1
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with (5, 0, 9). Total: 1
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with (0, 2, 4). Total: 1

Therefore, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph, which are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 0, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
