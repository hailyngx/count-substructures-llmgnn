Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 0, 6
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 1: has 2 neighbors, not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 4: has 2 neighbors, not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 5: has 2 neighbors, not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 6: has 2 neighbors, not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 7: has 2 neighbors, not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors, not a part of any 3-star.

In total, there are 4 unique 3-stars found. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
