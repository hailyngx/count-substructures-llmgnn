Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 8}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 1, 3 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 3, 4 neighbors: [4 3-stars]
- Node 5, 3 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 7, 5 neighbors: [10 3-stars]
- Node 9, 4 neighbors: [4 3-stars]

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4] = [21]

Unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 7)>
4. <3, (0, 7, 8)>
5. <3, (1, 7, 8)>
6. <5, (6, 7, 9)>
7. <7, (1, 2, 3)>
8. <7, (1, 3, 5)>
9. <7, (1, 3, 6)>
10. <7, (2, 3, 5)>
11. <7, (2, 3, 6)>
12. <7, (5, 6, 9)>
13. <7, (6, 7, 9)>
14. <7, (5, 7, 9)>
15. <7, (3, 5, 6)>
16. <7, (3, 5, 9)>
17. <7, (3, 6, 9)>
18. <7, (5, 7, 9)>
19. <7, (3, 6, 7)>
20. <9, (1, 4, 8)>
21. <9, (4, 5, 8)>
