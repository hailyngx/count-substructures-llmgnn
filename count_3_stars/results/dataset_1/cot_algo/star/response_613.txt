Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list based on the given edges:

Node 0: 4
Node 1: 3, 8
Node 2: 3, 8
Node 3: 1, 2, 4
Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 8
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 4
Node 9: 6

Now, let's analyze each node to see if any 3-stars can be formed:

Node 0: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 8)
Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 8)
Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 2, 4)
Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 2, 8)
Node 5: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
Node 6: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
Node 8: Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 2, 4)
Node 9: Does not have 3 or more neighbors

So, there are 4 unique 3-stars formed in this graph:
[4]
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
