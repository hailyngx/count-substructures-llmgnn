Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {2}
Node 1: {4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 2: {0, 8}
Node 3: {4, 7}
Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 9}
Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 6: {5, 9}
Node 7: {1, 3, 5}
Node 8: {2, 5}
Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 6}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph by looking at nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 7, 9}. There are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 3, 5, 9}. There are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}. There are 6 choose 3 = 20 possible 3-stars.
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6}. There are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of [4 + 4 + 20 + 4] = 32 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
