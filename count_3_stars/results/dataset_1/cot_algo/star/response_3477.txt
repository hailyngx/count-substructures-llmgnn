Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 4 + 4] = [18] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
