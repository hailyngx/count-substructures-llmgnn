Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {1, 4, 6}
Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 8}
Node 2: {1, 5, 7, 9}
Node 3: {5, 6}
Node 4: {0, 5}
Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
Node 6: {0, 3, 5}
Node 7: {2}
Node 8: {1, 5}
Node 9: {2}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 4 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 7 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 8 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 9 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
