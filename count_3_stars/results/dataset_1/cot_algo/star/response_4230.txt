Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Does not form 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Does not form 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: Does not form 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors (1, 5, 8).
- Node 4: Does not form 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors (0, 2, 9).
- Node 6: Does not form 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: Does not form 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: Does not form 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors (2, 4, 5).

So, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>
