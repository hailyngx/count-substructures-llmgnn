Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's find the number of 3-stars formed in this graph.

First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 25 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [25], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
