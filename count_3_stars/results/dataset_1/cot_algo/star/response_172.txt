Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7, 9: <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 7: <5, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2, and the unique 3-stars are <2, (5, 7, 9)> and <5, (1, 2, 7)>. Thus, the final answer is [2].
