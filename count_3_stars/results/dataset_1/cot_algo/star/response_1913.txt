Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, we'll check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 22

Therefore, the final answer is [22] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
