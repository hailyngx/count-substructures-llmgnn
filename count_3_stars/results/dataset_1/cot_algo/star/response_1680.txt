Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 and Node 4 have 4 neighbors each.

For calculating the number of 3-stars, we have 2 nodes to consider. 

For Node 1:
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 1 as the center: <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>

For Node 4:
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>.
