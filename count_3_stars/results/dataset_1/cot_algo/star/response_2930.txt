Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {0, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 8)>
<5, (8, 9, 6)>
<5, (8, 6, 9)>
<5, (9, 8, 6)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, 5)>
<8, (7, 5, 9)>
<8, (9, 7, 5)>
<8, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 8, 5)>
