Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 28, so the final result is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- <7, (5, 9, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
