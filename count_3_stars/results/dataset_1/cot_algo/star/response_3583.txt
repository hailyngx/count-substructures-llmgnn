Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 4, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 3, which we'll put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 3, 6>
- <4, 2, 9>
- <8, 3, 5>
