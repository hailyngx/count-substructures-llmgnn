Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors {5, 6, 7}, so there is 1 3-star: <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors {4, 6, 7}, so there is 1 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9}, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (8, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors {2, 6, 9}, so there is 1 3-star: <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors {1, 6, 9}, so there is 1 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors {0, 8, 9}, so there is 1 3-star: <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7}, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors {0, 1, 6, 9}, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors {2, 5}, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10] = [43]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (8, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>
