Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
