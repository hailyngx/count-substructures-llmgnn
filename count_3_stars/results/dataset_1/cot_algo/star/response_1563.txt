Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 8
- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 3 neighbors: 5
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 5
- Node 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 7

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, 9: <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, 6: <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 4, 7: <5, (2, 4, 7)>

Now, calculating the total number of 3-stars: [3]

So, the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
