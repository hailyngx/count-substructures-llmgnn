Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:

- Node 0: inom(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: inom(7, 3) = 35 3-stars
- Node 5: inom(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom(3, 3) = 1 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 35 + 10 + 1 = 50 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>
