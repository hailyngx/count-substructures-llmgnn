Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed: <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 = 5]

The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>.
