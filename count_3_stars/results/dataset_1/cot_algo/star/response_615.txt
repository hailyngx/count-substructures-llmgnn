Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's write down the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 8
Node 1: 0, 4, 5
Node 2: 0
Node 3: 5, 8
Node 4: 1, 6
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 9
Node 6: 4
Node 8: 0, 3
Node 9: 5

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 1, 5.

For node 0:
Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)> 

For node 1:
Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 5)>

For node 5:
Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>

Adding them up, we get a total of 13 3-stars: [13]
