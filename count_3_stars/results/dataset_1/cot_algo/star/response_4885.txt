Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {4}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 1] = [9]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
