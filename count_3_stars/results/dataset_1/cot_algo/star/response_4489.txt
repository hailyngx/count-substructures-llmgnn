Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 46, which we represent as [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
