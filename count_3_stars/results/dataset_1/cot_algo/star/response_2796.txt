Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 4
Node 1: 3, 9
Node 3: 1
Node 4: 0
Node 5: 8
Node 6: 8, 9
Node 7: 9
Node 8: 5, 6
Node 9: 1, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 1: It has 2 neighbors (3, 9), so it can form one 3-star. 
For Node 6: It has 2 neighbors (8, 9), so it can form one 3-star. 
For Node 9: It has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 7), so it can form one 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3 ([]).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (3, 9)>
<6, (8, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
