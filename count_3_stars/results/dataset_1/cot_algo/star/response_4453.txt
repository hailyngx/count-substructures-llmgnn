Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1: \(inom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
  - <1, (2, 4, 3)>

- Node 2: \(inom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
  - <2, (1, 4, 6)>

- Node 3: \(inom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
  - <3, (1, 6, 7)>

- Node 4: \(inom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
  - <4, (1, 2, 7)>

- Node 6: \(inom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
  - <6, (2, 3, 8)>

- Node 7: \(inom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
  - <7, (4, 1, 5)>
  - <7, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <7, (5, 8, 9)>
  - <7, (1, 3, 5)>

- Node 8: \(inom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
  - <8, (6, 5, 9)>

- Node 9: \(inom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
  - <9, (7, 8, 0)>

Therefore, within the given graph, there are total [11] 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 3)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (4, 1, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (6, 5, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 0)>
