Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1, 2 (2 neighbors)
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 2, 6 (2 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: 4, 8 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1, 4, 6, 8 (4 neighbors)

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14 \), which we put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 2, 3>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 4, 9>
<8, 4, 9>
<9, 6, 4>
<9, 6, 8>
<9, 4, 8>
<9, 4, 6>
