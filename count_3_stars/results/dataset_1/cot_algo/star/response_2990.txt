Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
