Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we can determine the number of 3-stars in this graph by following the steps described in the prompt. 

1. Node degrees:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4

2. Neighbor sets:
- Node 0 neighbors: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 1 neighbors: {9}
- Node 2 neighbors: {5, 9}
- Node 3 neighbors: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4 neighbors: {3}
- Node 5 neighbors: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 6 neighbors: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 7 neighbors: {3, 8}
- Node 8 neighbors: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 8}

3. Number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 0 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (8, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>.
