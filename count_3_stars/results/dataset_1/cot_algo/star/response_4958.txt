Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 also has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 also has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)> 

The final number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
