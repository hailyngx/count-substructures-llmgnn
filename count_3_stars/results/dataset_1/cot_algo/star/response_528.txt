Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: Nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (8, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (8, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (6, 8, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
