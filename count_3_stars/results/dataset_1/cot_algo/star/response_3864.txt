Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, and Node 4 each have 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.

For these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
