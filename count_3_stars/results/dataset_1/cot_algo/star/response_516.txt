Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following neighbors:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 3, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 5)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 3)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (6, 5, 3)>, <7, (6, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 3, 9)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Putting it all together, we have a total of [1 + 10] = 11 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 5)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 3)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (6, 5, 3)>, <7, (6, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 3, 9)>.
