Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 1: 2, 4, 7
Node 2: 1, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 5, 7, 9
Node 4: 1, 8
Node 5: 0, 3, 9
Node 6: 0, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 3
Node 8: 2, 4, 6
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 10] = 18.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 3, 5, 9>
<3, 0, 5, 9>
<9, 0, 2, 6>
<9, 0, 3, 5>
<9, 0, 3, 6>
<9, 2, 3, 5>
<9, 2, 3, 6>
<9, 3, 5, 6>
<9, 5, 6, 0>
<9, 5, 6, 3>
