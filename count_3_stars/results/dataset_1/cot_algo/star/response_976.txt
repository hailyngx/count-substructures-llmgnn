Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {2, 9}
Node 1: {6, 8}
Node 2: {0, 6, 7, 9}
Node 3: {4, 9}
Node 4: {3}
Node 5: {8, 9}
Node 6: {1, 2}
Node 7: {2, 9}
Node 8: {1, 5}
Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 10] = 14 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
