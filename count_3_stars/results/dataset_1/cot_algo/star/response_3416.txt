Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, we'll check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars
- Other nodes do not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1+4 = 5], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>.
