Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2 and Node 4 each have 3 neighbors, so they form 1 3-star each.
- Node 5 and Node 8 each have 4 neighbors, so they form 4C3 = 4 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2+4+4] = 10.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
