Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 5
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 5
- Node 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 8
- Node 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 6 neighbors: 3, 4
- Node 7 neighbors: 8
- Node 8 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
