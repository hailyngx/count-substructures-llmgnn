Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Since we have 5 nodes with 4 neighbors, we have 5 * \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 20 3-stars.
- For node 7 with 3 neighbors, we have \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [20 + 1] = 21.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
