Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 8

Next, we will identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-star graphs:
- For Node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star graphs with it as the center node.
- For Node 2, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star graphs with it as the center node.
- For Node 5, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star graph with it as the center node.
- For Node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star graphs with it as the center node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs is \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 13 \).

The unique 3-star graphs found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
