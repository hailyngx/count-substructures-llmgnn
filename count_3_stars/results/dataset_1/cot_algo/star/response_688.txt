Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 0, 3

Next, we check the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: No 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: No 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-star (only 2 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3, and they are:
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)> 

So, the final answer is [3].
