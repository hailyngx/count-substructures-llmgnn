Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 46 edges, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors. 
- Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 4: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 21, so the final result is [21].
