Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 0, 9
- Node 4: 0, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's check nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1] = 5.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (8, 6, 9)>
