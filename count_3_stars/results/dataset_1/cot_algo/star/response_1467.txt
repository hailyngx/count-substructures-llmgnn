Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 2 3-stars <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 7, 6)>
- Node 2: 0 3-stars
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 0 3-stars
- Node 5: 0 3-stars
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star <7, (2, 1, 6)>
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 7, 6)>, <7, (2, 1, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>
