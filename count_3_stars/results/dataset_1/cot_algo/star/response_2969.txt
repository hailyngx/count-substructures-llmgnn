Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 6
- Node 6: 0, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 6, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <0, (6, 7, 9)>.
