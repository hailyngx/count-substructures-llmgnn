Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [3] <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 1: [1] <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2: [1] <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 4: [1] <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [1] <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [0]
- Node 9: [0]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, and <6, (1, 2, 3)>.
