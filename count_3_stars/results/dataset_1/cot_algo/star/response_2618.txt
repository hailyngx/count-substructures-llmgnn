Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 6: {7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: Does not form any 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 1: 1 3-star <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 2: Does not form any 3-star since it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: Does not form any 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 4: Does not form any 3-star since it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 5: 1 3-star <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 6: Does not form any 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 7: Does not form any 3-star since it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: Does not form any 3-star since it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: Does not form any 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 4, 5)> and <5, (0, 1, 8)>.
