Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {5}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
