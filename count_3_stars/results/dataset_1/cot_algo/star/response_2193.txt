Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can create the following 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (3, 6, 7)
2. Node 1: (4, 5, 7), (4, 5, 9)
3. Node 2: (3, 5, 8)
4. Node 3: (0, 4, 6), (0, 5, 9), (2, 4, 8)
5. Node 4: (1, 3, 5)
6. Node 5: (1, 2, 8), (3, 5, 9)
7. Node 6: (0, 3, 7)
8. Node 7: (1, 6, 8)
9. Node 8: (2, 5, 9)
10. Node 9: (5, 8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 12, which can be represented as [12].
