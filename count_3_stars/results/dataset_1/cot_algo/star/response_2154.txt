Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its nodes and neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 8
Node 1: 0, 3, 5
Node 2: 6, 7
Node 3: 1, 5, 8
Node 5: 1, 3, 7
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 2, 5
Node 8: 0, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<1, (0, 8, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
