Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

For node 1, there are inom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star.
Thus, there are 10 different 3-stars centered at node 1:
<1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
