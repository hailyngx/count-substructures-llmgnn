Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {1, 2}
- Node 6: {0, 9}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
Nodes 0, 1, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, meaning they can potentially form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 9, 6)>
