Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
