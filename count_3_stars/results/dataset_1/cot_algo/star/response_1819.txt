Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's calculate the 3-star formations:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 20.

Therefore, there are a total of 20 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, and <8, (0, 1, 9)>.
