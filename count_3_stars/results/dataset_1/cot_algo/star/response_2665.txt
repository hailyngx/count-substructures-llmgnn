Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 0, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Yes, 5 neighbors
- Node 1: Yes, 3 neighbors
- Node 2: No, less than 3 neighbors
- Node 3: No, less than 3 neighbors
- Node 4: Yes, 2 neighbors
- Node 5: Yes, 4 neighbors
- Node 6: No, less than 3 neighbors
- Node 7: Yes, 2 neighbors
- Node 8: Yes, 3 neighbors
- Node 9: Yes, 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: Only 1 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: Only 1 3-star
- Node 9: Only 1 3-star

Adding them up, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 17. 

Therefore, the final answer is [17] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, and <9, (0, 8, 4)>.
