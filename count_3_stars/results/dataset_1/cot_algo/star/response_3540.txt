Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 1: {7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- For Node 3, as it has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- For Node 4, there are also 4 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- For Node 5, there is 1 3-star: <5, (4, 7, 8)>

Summing up the 3-stars, we have a total of 9 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [9].
