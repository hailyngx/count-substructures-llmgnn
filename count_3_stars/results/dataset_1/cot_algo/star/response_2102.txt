Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
