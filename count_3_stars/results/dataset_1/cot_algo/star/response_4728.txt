Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the final answer is [23] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 8)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
