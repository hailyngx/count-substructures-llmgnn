Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Node 1, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 9.

For Node 1:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 9)>

For Node 5:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 8)>

For Node 7:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <7, (6, 8, 9)>

For Node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7]

So, the final result is: [7]
