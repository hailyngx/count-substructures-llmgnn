Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7

Node 0 does not have at least 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 unique 3-star: <2, (0, 7, 3)>.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>.
Node 4 does not have at least 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 5 does not have at least 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 unique 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 8)>.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 unique 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 8)>.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10] = 23.
