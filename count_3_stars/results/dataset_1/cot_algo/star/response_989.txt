Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the final result is [21] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
