Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
