Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's first list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2, 5}
Node 1: {4, 5, 6}
Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 8}
Node 3: {2, 8}
Node 4: {1, 7, 9}
Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
Node 6: {1, 9}
Node 7: {4, 5, 8, 9}
Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 7}
Node 9: {4, 6, 7}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [15]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 4)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
