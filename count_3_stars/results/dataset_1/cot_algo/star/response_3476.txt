Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The node degrees for this graph are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: [1 three-star] -> <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 1: [1 three-star] -> <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 2: [1 three-star] -> <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 3: [1 three-star] -> <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 8: [1 three-star] -> <8, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 9: [1 three-star] -> <9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, and <9, (2, 3, 5)>.
