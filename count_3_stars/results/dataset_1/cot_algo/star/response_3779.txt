Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11]

Unique 3-stars found: <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>. 
So the final result is: [11]
