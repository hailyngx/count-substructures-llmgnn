Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {4, 9}
Node 1: {4, 9}
Node 2: {5}
Node 3: {4, 8}
Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
Node 5: {2, 4, 8}
Node 6: {9}
Node 7: {8, 9}
Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 7}
Node 9: {0, 1, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:  

For node 0, we have 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.  
For node 1, we have 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.  
For node 2, we have 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.  
For node 3, we have 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.  
For node 4, we have 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
For node 5, we have 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed.  
For node 6, we have 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.  
For node 7, we have 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.  
For node 8, we have 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 9, we have 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

Adding up the 3-stars from each node gives us a total of 19 3-stars, which we will write as [19].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<4, (0, 1, 5)>  
<4, (0, 1, 8)>  
<4, (0, 3, 5)>  
<4, (0, 3, 8)>  
<4, (1, 3, 5)>  
<4, (1, 3, 8)>  
<4, (3, 5, 8)>  
<5, (2, 4, 8)>  
<8, (3, 4, 5)>  
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
