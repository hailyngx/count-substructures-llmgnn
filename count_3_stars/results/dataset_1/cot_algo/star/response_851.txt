Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 24

So, the total number of 3-stars is [24].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (6, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 6, 0)>, <4, (6, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 1, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 0, 7)>, <6, (4, 0, 5)>, <7, (6, 1, 0)>, <7, (4, 5, 0)>, <7, (4, 0, 6)>, <7, (4, 0, 5)>, <7, (4, 9, 0)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>
