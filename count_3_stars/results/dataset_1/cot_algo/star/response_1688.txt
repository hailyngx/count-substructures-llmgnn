Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edge list:
- \( (0, 4) \)
- \( (1, 2), (1, 6) \)
- \( (2, 1), (2, 5) \)
- \( (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9) \)
- \( (5, 2), (5, 4) \)
- \( (6, 1), (6, 7) \)
- \( (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9) \)
- \( (8, 9) \)
- \( (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 8) \)

Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

### Node neighborhoods:
- Node 0: \(\{4\}\)
- Node 1: \(\{2, 6\}\)
- Node 2: \(\{1, 5\}\)
- Node 4: \(\{0, 5, 7, 9\}\)
- Node 5: \(\{2, 4\}\)
- Node 6: \(\{1, 7\}\)
- Node 7: \(\{4, 6, 9\}\)
- Node 8: \(\{9\}\)
- Node 9: \(\{4, 7, 8\}\)

### 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 6)>
- Node 4 forms 3 3-stars: <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 0)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (4, 6, 9)>

There are 5 3-stars in total, so the final count is [5].
