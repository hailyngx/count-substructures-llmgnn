Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

1: {2, 7}
2: {1}
3: {5, 8}
4: {5, 6, 8}
5: {3, 4, 8}
6: {4, 7, 9}
7: {1, 6, 9}
8: {3, 4, 5, 9}
9: {6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of [9] 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<4, 5, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
