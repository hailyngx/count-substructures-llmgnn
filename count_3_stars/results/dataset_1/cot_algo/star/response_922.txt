Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {0, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 8}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 6 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 17, and they are:
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)> 

Please note that the brackets [] contain the final count of 3-stars, which is 17 in this case.
