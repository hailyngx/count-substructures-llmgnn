Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 5)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (Nodes 3, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (Nodes 3, 6)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (Nodes 1, 2, 5, 1)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (Nodes 5, 6, 9)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (Nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, 8)
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (Node 6)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (Nodes 6, 9)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (Nodes 1, 4, 8)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, and Node 6 have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 3-stars each.
- Node 4, Node 6, and Node 9 have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\(4 \times 4 + 3 \times 1 + 4 \times 1 = 16 + 3 + 4 = 23\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 7)>.
