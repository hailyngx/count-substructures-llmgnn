Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, Node 4, and Node 7 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 3-stars each.
- Node 2 and Node 9 each have 6 neighbors, so they can form 20 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- \( 4 \times 1 + 20 \times 2 = 4 + 40 = 44 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [44].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
