Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 8, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
