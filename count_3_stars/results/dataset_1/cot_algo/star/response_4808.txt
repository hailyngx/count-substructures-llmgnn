Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: Forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 7: Forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 19
So, the total number of 3-stars is [19].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 1, 7>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <7, 6, 9>
