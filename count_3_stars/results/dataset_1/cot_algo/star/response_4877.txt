Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Next, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

The total number of 3-star configurations [] is 56.
The unique 3-stars found <> are:
<1, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 7)>,
<3, (2, 6, 9)>,
<6, (3, 5, 7)>,
<7, (0, 2, 9)>, and 
<9, (1, 3, 7)>.
