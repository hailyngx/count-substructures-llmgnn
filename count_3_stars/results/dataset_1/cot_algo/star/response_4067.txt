Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0 and node 8.

For node 0:
Neighbors: 2, 4, 8
Number of 3-stars: 1

For node 8:
Neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 20 = 21]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
