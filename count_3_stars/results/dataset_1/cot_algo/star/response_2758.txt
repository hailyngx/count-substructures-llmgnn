Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 3
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5

Now, let's identify potential 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) is the number of 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) is the number of 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) is the number of 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) is the number of 3-stars.

Adding up the number of 3-stars, we get a total of \( [1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [29] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
