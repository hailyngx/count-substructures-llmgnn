Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14, which can be written as [14]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
