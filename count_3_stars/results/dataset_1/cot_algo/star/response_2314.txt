Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \([1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 17\)

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>
