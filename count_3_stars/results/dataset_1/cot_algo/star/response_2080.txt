Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5
- Node 8: No edges
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 9 have 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so they don't form any 3-stars.
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, and Node 9 have 3 neighbors and will each form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors and will also form 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
