Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 1: 0, 4 (degree 2)
- Node 2: 5, 7 (degree 2)
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8 (degree 3)
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 6: 0, 8 (degree 2)
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5 (degree 3)
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 8 (degree 4)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 32

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
