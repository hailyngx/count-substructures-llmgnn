Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are nodes 4 and 6
- Node 1: Neighbor is node 6
- Node 3: Neighbors are nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are nodes 3 and 4
- Node 6: Neighbors are nodes 0, 1, and 3
- Node 8: Neighbors are nodes 3 and 4
- Node 9: Neighbor is node 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \(10 + 4 = 14\).

The unique 3-stars are: <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, and <6, (0, 1, 3)>.

So, the final answer is [14].
