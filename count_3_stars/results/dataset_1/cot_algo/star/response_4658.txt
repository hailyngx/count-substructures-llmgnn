Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {0, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0, Node 4, and Node 6 have 5 or more neighbors so we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars for each of them. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30, which can be represented as [30].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>
