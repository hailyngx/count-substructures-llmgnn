Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 6

Now, we'll count the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star per node (total 7 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 2, 6)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
