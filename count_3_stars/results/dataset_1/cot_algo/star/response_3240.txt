Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed using \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>.
