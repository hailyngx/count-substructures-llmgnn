Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 3}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed. We will check nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 2, and 9 have 6, 7, and 3 neighbors respectively. So, we need to calculate \( inom{n}{3} \) for these nodes.
  - For node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - For node 2: \( inom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
  - For node 9: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Hence, in total, there are [1 + 35 + 1] = 37 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 1)>, <2, (4, 6, 3)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 1, 6)>, <2, (5, 3, 4)>, <2, (5, 3, 6)>, <2, (5, 3, 9)>, <2, (7, 3, 6)>, <2, (7, 4, 6)>, <2, (9, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 1, 8)>.
