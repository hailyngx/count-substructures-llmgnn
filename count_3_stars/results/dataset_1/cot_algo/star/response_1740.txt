Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 36 \)

Therefore, we have a total of [36] 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
