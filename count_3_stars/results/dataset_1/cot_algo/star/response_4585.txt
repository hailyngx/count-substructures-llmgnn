Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges in a more readable format:

Node 0: 4, 7
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7
Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 2, 3, 8
Node 6: 4, 8
Node 7: 0, 2, 8, 9
Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 9: 3, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in this graph.

For Node 4: (2, 3, 6)
For Node 3: (5, 8, 9)

Therefore, we have a total of [2] unique 3-stars: <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>.
