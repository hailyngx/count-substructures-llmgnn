Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

For these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: 1 3-star (1 choose 3 = 1)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star (4 choose 3 = 1)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from Node 1) + 10 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 4) + 4 (from Node 5) + 4 (from Node 8) + 1 (from Node 9) = 21

Therefore, the final answer is [21] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 0, 5)>
<2, (5, 4, 9)>
<2, (8, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (5, 2, 8)>
<5, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 2, 9)>
<8, (8, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
