Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each of the nodes above can form:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9, so we have [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<<4, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 9, 1)>, <9, (7, 1, 0)>, <9, (7, 1, 9)>, <9, (7, 0, 1)>, <9, (4, 9, 7)> >
