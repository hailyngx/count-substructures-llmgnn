Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 6

Now, we will check each node to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors will be considered:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us 5, so we have [5] in total.
