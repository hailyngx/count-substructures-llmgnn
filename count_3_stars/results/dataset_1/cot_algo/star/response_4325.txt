Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 6

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with 0.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with 2.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with 3.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with 4.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4
Therefore, the final number inside brackets [] is [4].
