Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 6}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 53

Therefore, the final result is [53] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>.
