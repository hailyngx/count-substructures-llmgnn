Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 6}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3, 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8, 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( [4 + 10 + 1 + 10] = [25] \)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are: <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>.
