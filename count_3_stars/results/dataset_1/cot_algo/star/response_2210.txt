Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8

Now we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
   - <0, (3, 4, 5)>
   - <0, (3, 4, 8)>
   - <0, (3, 4, 9)>
   - <0, (3, 5, 8)>
   - <0, (3, 5, 9)>
   - <0, (3, 8, 9)>
   - <0, (4, 5, 8)>
   - <0, (4, 5, 9)>
   - <0, (4, 8, 9)>
   - <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
   - <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
   - <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   - <4, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <4, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <4, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
   - <9, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 7)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 8)>
   - <9, (0, 2, 7)>
   - <9, (0, 2, 8)>
   - <9, (0, 7, 8)>
   - <9, (1, 2, 7)>
   - <9, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <9, (1, 7, 8)>
   - <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 26.
Therefore, the final answer is [26].
