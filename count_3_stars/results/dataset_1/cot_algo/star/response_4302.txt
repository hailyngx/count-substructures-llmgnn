Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 4, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 5: 1, 8 (2 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 4, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8 (5 neighbors)

Now, let's look for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (8, 5, 7)>
<4, (8, 5, 9)>
<4, (8, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 8, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 8, 4)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
