Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 2 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 2
- Node 4 neighbors: 6, 7
- Node 6 neighbors: 2, 4, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 7, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7, so the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
