Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 9)>
