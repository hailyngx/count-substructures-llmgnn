Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [13]

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>
