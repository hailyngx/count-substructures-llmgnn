Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars and list them, we first need to determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1 neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 7, 8, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4 neighbors: 6
- Node 5 neighbors: 3
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 2

Now, we count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 25 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [25], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
