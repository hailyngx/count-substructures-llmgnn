Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 19 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, (2, 6, 8)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <3, (2, 4, 5)>
4. <6, (0, 1, 5)>
