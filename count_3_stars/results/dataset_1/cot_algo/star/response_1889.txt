Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 8
Node 2 neighbors: 7
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 8
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 7
Node 6 neighbors: 3, 7, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 2, 5, 6
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 6, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (4, 5, 3)>

Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star:
<3, (0, 5, 6)>

Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star:
<5, (0, 3, 7)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star:
<6, (3, 7, 9)>

Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star:
<7, (2, 5, 6)>

Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star:
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Putting all unique 3-stars inside <>:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (4, 5, 3)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 10, so the final answer is [10].
