Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph and list them, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 6
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 7
- Node 4: Neighbors are 2, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 7, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 1, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 3, 5
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 4, 5
- Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 6

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars by counting the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 2: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 6: 3 choose 3 = 1

Adding these up: [4 + 10 + 1] = [15]

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
