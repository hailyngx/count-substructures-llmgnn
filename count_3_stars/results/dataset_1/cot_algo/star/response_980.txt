Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3

Based on the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
