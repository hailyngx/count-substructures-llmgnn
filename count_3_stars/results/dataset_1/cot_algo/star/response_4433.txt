Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will first find the neighbor set of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbor {9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor {6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms one 3-star with neighbors (3, 4, 6): <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 forms one 3-star with neighbors (5, 8, 9): <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms one 3-star with neighbors (7, 8, 9): <6, (7, 8, 9)>

Finally, we put the total number of 3-stars in brackets:

Total number of 3-stars: [3]
