Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbor nodes {4}
- Node 1: neighbor nodes {2, 6, 8}
- Node 2: neighbor nodes {1, 6}
- Node 3: neighbor nodes {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbor nodes {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: neighbor nodes {1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: neighbor nodes {4}
- Node 8: neighbor nodes {1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: neighbor nodes {3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 6, 8} => <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 6, 8} => <3, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 2, which we represent as [2].
