Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: [2]
- Node 1: [5, 6]
- Node 2: [0, 3, 5, 8, 9]
- Node 3: [2]
- Node 4: [6, 7]
- Node 5: [1, 2, 7]
- Node 6: [1, 4, 7]
- Node 7: [4, 5, 6, 9]
- Node 8: [2]
- Node 9: [2, 7]

Now, we need to determine the number of 3-stars in this graph. We will focus on nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 0 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 15\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 15. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
