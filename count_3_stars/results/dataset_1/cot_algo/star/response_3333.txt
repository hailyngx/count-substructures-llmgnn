Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures in this graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 9: <2, (4, 5, 9)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 9: <5, (2, 8, 9)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6: <8, (4, 5, 6)>
Node 8 also forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7: <8, (5, 6, 7)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 6: <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
