Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes are {9}.
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes are {6}.
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes are {3}.
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes are {2, 7}.
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes are {7}.
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes are {1, 8}.
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes are {3, 4, 8}.
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes are {6, 7}.
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes are {0}.

Now, let's check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. The 3-star is <7, (3, 4, 8)>.
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <7, (3, 4, 8)>.
