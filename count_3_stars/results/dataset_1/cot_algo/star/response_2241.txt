Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {2}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {0}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 10

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 3)>
<9, (0, 6, 1)>
