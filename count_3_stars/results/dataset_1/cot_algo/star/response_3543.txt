Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we can determine the 3-stars present in the graph by examining the neighbor sets of each node. 

Node 1 neighbors: {4, 7}
Node 2 neighbors: {5, 8}
Node 3 neighbors: {5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 7, 8}
Node 5 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
Node 6 neighbors: {3}
Node 7 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 5}
Node 8 neighbors: {2, 4, 5}
Node 9 neighbors: {3, 5}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1] = 6. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the given graph.
