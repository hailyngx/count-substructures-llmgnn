Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the unique 3-stars in the given graph, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {4, 6}
Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 9}
Node 2: {7, 8}
Node 3: {1, 4, 9}
Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
Node 5: {4, 7, 8}
Node 6: {0, 1, 8}
Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 8}
Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's list the 3-stars:

<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 0, 3)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [4].
