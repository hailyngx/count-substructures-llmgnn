Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 8
- Node 3: Neighbors are 7, 8
- Node 4: Neighbors are 7, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 8
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star: <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
