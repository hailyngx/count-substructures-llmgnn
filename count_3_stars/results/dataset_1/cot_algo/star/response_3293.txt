Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 3, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
