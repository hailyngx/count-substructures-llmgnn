Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {8}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 4, 6}

Now, for the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, we will count the 3-stars:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\)

Therefore, the final answer is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 9, 5)>, <4, (9, 6, 5)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 0, 9)>, <9, (6, 3, 4)>.
