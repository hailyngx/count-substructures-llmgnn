Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 7

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of 24 3-stars in this graph, represented as follows:
\[ [24] \]
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (4, 7, 9)>
