Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 8}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of 4 + 1 = 5 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)> 

Putting the final count in brackets, the result is [5].
