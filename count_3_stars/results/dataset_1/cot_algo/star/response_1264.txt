Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's analyze the 3-star structures present in the graph:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {6, 9}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {4}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {8}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 8, 9}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {9}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {3, 9}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 9}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves (6, 7, 8) <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves (6, 8, 9) <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves (3, 4, 9) <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves (4, 7, 8) <9, (4, 7, 8)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
