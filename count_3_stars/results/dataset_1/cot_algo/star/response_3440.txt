Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 8 (degree = 4)
- Node 1: 8 (degree = 1)
- Node 2: 5, 9 (degree = 2)
- Node 3: 0, 7 (degree = 2)
- Node 5: 2, 8 (degree = 2)
- Node 6: 0 (degree = 1)
- Node 7: 0, 3 (degree = 2)
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5 (degree = 3)
- Node 9: 2 (degree = 1)

Now, we need to find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 1 = 5]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, and <8, (1, 5, 0)>.
