Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3

Now, we can identify the 3-stars formed in this graph by calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
  - <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
  - <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives a final count of [20].
