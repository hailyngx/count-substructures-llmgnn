Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 2 -- 8
|    |    |
5    6    3
|    |    |
9    4 -- 7
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7}.
- Node 2 has neighbors {0, 6, 8, 9}.
- Node 5 has neighbors {0, 3, 8, 9}.
- Node 6 has neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}.
- Node 8 has neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}.
- Node 9 has neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7}.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars, creating <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>.
- Node 2 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars, creating <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 9, 5)>.
- Node 5 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars, creating <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>.
- Node 6 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars, creating <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 7)>.
- Node 8 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars, creating <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 9, 2)>.
- Node 9 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars, creating <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 36, and the unique 3-star configurations are <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 9, 5)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 9, 2)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 2)>.
