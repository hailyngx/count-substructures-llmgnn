Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>

Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
<2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star:
<6, (0, 4, 7)>

Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
<7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 31, so the final answer is [31].
