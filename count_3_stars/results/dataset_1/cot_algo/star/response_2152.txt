Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, with neighbors 5, 6, 7
- Node 2, with neighbors 0, 5, 9
- Node 3, with neighbors 5, 6, 9
- Node 7, with neighbors 1, 6, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
