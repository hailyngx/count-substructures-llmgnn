Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {1, 5, 9}
Node 1: {0}
Node 2: {7, 9}
Node 4: {7, 8, 9}
Node 5: {0, 7, 9}
Node 6: {9}
Node 7: {2, 4, 5}
Node 8: {4, 9}
Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 24

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
