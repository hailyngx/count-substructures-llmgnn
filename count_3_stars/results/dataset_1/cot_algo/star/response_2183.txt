Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors ({0, 8, 9}), so 1 3-star.
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors ({1, 5, 6, 9}), so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors ({0, 6, 8, 9}), so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: has 7 neighbors, so \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 35 = 54 \)

Inside brackets: [54]

Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>
