Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to node 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 9. <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7. <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 9. <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9. <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5. <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Since each of these nodes forms a unique 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
