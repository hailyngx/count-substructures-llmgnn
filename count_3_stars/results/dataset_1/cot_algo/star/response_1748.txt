Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can first find the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 3}
- Node 2: {0, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on the neighborhood sets:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 3, 6)> and <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (2, 3, 5)> and <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7].
