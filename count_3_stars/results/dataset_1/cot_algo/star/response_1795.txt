Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and edges of the graph are given below:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6)
(1, 9)
(2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)
(3, 0), (3, 8), (3, 9)
(4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9)
(5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8)
(6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 9)
(7, 2), (7, 8)
(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9)
(9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph.

Neighbors of each node:
0: {3, 5, 6}
1: {9}
2: {4, 6, 7, 8}
3: {0, 8, 9}
4: {2, 5, 6, 9}
5: {0, 4, 6, 8}
6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
7: {2, 8}
8: {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
9: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<2, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<2, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<2, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<4, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<4, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<5, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<5, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<5, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<5, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<6, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 9)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<8, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<8, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<8, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<8, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<8, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<8, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<9, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<9, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<9, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<9, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
