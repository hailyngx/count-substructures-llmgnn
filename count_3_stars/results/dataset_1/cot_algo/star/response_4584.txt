Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- From the neighbor sets, nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors:
    - Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
    - Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
    - Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 8. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
