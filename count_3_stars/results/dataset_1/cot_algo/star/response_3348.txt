Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 4 + 10 = 34, which we represent as [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
