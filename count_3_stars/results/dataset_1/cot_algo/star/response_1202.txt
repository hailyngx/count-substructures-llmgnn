Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 2: 1, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 8
Node 4: 7
Node 5: 0, 1, 7
Node 7: 0, 4, 5
Node 8: 1, 3, 9
Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18
Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [18].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
