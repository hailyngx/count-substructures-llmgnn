Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Yes (3 neighbors)
- Node 1: Yes (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Yes (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: No (2 neighbors)
- Node 4: No (2 neighbors)
- Node 5: No (2 neighbors)
- Node 6: Yes (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: Yes (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: No (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: Yes (3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [5]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
