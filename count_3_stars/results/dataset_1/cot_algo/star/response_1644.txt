Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8 (degree 3)
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8 (degree 5)
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 (degree 5)
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7 (degree 5)
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6 (degree 3)
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8 (degree 5)
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 (degree 5)
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 (degree 5)

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 4, 6: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 4, 8: <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, 8: <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, 8: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, 8: <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 5, 7: <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 7, 8: <6, (3, 7, 8)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in this graph.
