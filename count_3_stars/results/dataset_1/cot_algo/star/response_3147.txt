Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 5, 6
Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 4, 6
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 4, 6
Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 6
Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8
Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 9
Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 4 and Node 6 have 6 neighbors each, so they each contribute \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 (from Node 4) + 20 (from Node 6) = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40], and the unique 3-stars found are <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>.
