Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 8, 9}
Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4}
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4}
Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}
Node 9: Neighbors {3}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29]. The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>
