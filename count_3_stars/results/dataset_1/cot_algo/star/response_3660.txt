Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 6}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
For Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Therefore, there are a total of [4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 13 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
