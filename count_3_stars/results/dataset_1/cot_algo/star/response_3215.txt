Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its edges in terms of nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: No 3-stars formed (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-stars formed (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-stars formed (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-stars formed (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-stars formed (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars formed (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-stars formed (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: No 3-stars formed (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-stars formed (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1 3-star formed

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \[ [1] \]

The unique 3-star found:
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
