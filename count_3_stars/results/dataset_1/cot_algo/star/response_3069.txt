Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 8}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {2, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2}
- Node 8: {3, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 8}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4] = 8 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 9, 5)>
- <2, (5, 9, 7)>
- <2, (7, 9, 3)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
