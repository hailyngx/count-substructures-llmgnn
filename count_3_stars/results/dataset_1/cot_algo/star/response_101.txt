Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format for easier visualization:

Node 0: 4, 6, 9
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 1, 8, 9
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 0, 7
Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 5
Node 7: 4, 5
Node 8: 2, 5
Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 6, 9
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 1, 8, 9
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 0, 7
Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 5
Node 7: 4, 5
Node 8: 2, 5
Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
