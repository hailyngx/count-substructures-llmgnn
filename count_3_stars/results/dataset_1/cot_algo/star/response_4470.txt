Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the 3-star graph can be analyzed as follows:

- Node 0 has neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 1 has neighbors {2, 6, 8}
- Node 2 has neighbors {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3 has neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4 has neighbors {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5 has neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 6 has neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7 has neighbors {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8 has neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9 has neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 7, 9} and any permutation of them, total = 3! = 6 3-star graphs.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 7, 9} and any permutation of them, total = 3! = 6 3-star graphs.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {3, 7, 9} and any permutation of them, total = 3! = 6 3-star graphs.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {7, 8, 2} and any permutation of them, total = 3! = 6 3-star graphs.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: [6 + 6 + 6 + 6] = [24]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (7, 8, 2)>
