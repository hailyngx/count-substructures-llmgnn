Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 2, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 5}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:  
- Node 1 forms 1 star
- Node 3 forms 1 star
- Node 8 forms 1 star
- Node 9 forms 1 star

So, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
