Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

Node 0: 1, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 2: 3, 5, 9
Node 3: 2, 4, 9
Node 4: 1, 3, 7
Node 5: 1, 2, 6
Node 6: 5, 7
Node 7: 0, 4, 6
Node 8: 0, 1
Node 9: 1, 2, 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 5) - 1 3-star
Node 3: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 9) - 1 3-star
Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 6) - 1 3-star
Node 9: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 3) - 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4

Therefore, the final result is [4], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
