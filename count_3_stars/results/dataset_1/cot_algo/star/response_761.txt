Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 4, 7, 9
Node 1: 2, 4
Node 2: 1, 7
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 8
Node 5: 9
Node 6: 7
Node 7: 0, 2, 6
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4] = [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 3)>
