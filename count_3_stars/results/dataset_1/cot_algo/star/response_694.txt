Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the final result is [52] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
