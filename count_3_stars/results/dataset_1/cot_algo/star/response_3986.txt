Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with {4, 5, 8}
- Node 2 forms two 3-stars:
  - With {1, 4, 6}
  - With {4, 6, 8}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with {1, 6, 7}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 2 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>.
