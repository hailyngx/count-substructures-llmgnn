Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10 \), so we put 10 inside brackets: \[10\].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (7, 9, 0)>
- <8, (7, 9, 1)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (4, 8, 0)>
- <9, (4, 8, 2)>
