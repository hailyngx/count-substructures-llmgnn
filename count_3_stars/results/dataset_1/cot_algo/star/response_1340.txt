Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 1: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 2: has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.
- Node 3: has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.
- Node 4: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 6: has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 9: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [1+1+1] = 3

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
