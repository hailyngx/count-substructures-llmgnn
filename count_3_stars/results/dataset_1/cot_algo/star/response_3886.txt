Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 5}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-stars (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-stars (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: [1] <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 5: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: [2] <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 7: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-stars (has only 1 neighbor)
- Node 9: [1] <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars found: 
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>
