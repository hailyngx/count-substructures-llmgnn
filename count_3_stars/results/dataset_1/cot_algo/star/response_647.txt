Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 20.
Therefore, the final answer is [20]. The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>.
