Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 20 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
