Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 3, 5

Since nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 have 4, 5, 4, and 5 neighbors respectively, they can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 10 + 4 + 10] = [28] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
