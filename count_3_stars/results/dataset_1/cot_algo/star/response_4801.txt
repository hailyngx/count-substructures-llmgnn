Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6

Now, let's check for each node that has 3 or more neighbors to see if it can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors - can form 1 3-star
- Node 2: 4 neighbors - can form 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors - can form 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 6 neighbors - can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 3 neighbors - can form 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 30 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>.
