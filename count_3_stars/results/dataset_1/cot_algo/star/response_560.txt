Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 3, 9
- Node 1: neighbor is 8
- Node 2: neighbor is 6
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 8
- Node 4: neighbors are 6, 7
- Node 5: neighbor is 6
- Node 6: neighbors are 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: neighbors are 4, 6
- Node 8: neighbors are 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: neighbors are 0, 6, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For each of Nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, and 9, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 6, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 15, which we will denote as [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (3, 9, 8)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
