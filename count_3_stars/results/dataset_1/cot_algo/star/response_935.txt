Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 6
Node 2: 5, 8
Node 3: 4, 6, 7
Node 4: 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 5: 2, 4, 7
Node 6: 0, 3
Node 7: 3, 5
Node 8: 2, 4
Node 9: 4

Next, let's identify any 3-stars formed:
Only Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Using the combination formula, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 4 as the center. The unique 3-stars are <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>.
