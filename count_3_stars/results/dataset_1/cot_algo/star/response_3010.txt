Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 0, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 0, 5, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 5)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 3)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 4, 5)>
<0, (7, 4, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
