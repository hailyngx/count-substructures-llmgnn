Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculate the number of 3-stars: 
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
