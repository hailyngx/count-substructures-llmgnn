Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 9), (3, 1), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 7)

Next, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 7
- Node 4: Neighbors are 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 6
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 5, 8
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 6, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 7

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 7 have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: [1 7 9] => In total, 1 3-star
- Node 1: [0 3 6 9] => In total, 4 3-stars
- Node 7: [0 3 4 8 9] => In total, 10 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is: [15]
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 6)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<1, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<1, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 4)>,
<7, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 4, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 4, 9)>,
<7, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<7, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<7, (4, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
