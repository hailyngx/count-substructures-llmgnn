Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 5

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 = 2.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<[5, 3, 7]>
<[7, 3, 5]>
