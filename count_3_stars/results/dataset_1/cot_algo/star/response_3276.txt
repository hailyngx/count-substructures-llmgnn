Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 7, 9.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 6, 7.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 5, 6.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 3, 9.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 3, 7, 9.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 2, 6.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 5, 6.

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 and Node 6 both have 3 neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 = 5 \]
So, there are 5 total 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
