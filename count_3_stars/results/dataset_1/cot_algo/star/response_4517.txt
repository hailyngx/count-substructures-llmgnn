Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 2, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6

Now we'll check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

So, there are a total of 45 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
