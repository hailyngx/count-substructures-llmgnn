Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {4, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {3}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0}

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star. 
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star. 
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star. 
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1] = [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
