Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, allowing it to form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, allowing it to form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, allowing it to form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20 + 4 + 4 = 28].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
