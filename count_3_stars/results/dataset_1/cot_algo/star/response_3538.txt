Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7

Now, we need to check for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form multiple 3-stars.
    - We can calculate the number of 3-stars using \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 8) = 13. 
Thus, the final answer, to be enclosed in brackets, is [13].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<4, 1, 5>
<8, 0, 1>
<8, 0, 2>
<8, 0, 4>
<8, 0, 7>
<8, 1, 2>
<8, 1, 4>
<8, 1, 7>
<8, 2, 4>
<8, 2, 7>
<8, 4, 7>
