Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 2

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 2>
