Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7, 8

Next, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, and Node 5 each have 3 neighbors, so they can each form a 3-star.
- Node 4 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  
Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 5) + 10 (from Node 4) = 13

So, the total number of 3-stars is [13].

List of unique 3-stars:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 8, 9>
