Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 6, 7, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so can form 1 3-star
- Node 3: has 5 neighbors, so can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors, so can form 1 3-star
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors, so can form 1 3-star
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, so can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors, so can form 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 18
Therefore, the final answer is [18].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 8, 6)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (6, 0, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>.
