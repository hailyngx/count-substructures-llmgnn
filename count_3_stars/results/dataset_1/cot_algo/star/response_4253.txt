Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3.

Therefore, there is 1 3-star. The unique 3-star is <2, (3, 5, 7)>.

So, the final answer is [1].
