Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (8, 3), (9, 1)

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, 6. Possible 3-stars = [1]

For node 1: Neighbors are 0, 3, 9. Possible 3-stars = [1, 3, 9]

For node 2: Neighbors are 0, 5. No 3-stars can be formed.

For node 3: Neighbors are 1, 4, 6, 8. Possible 3-stars = [(1, 4, 6)]

For node 4: Neighbors are 3, 5. No 3-stars can be formed.

For node 5: Neighbors are 2, 4. No 3-stars can be formed.

For node 6: Neighbors are 0, 3. No 3-stars can be formed.

For node 8: Neighbor is 3. No 3-stars can be formed.

For node 9: Neighbor is 1. No 3-stars can be formed.

Total number of 3-stars = [1] + [3, 9] + [(1, 4, 6)] = 3

So, the final representation is:
Total number of 3-stars: [3]
Unique 3-stars found: <1, (3, 9), (1, 4, 6)>
