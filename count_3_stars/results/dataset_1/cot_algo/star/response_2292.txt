Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2, 8, 9}
Node 2: {1, 4, 7}
Node 3: {5}
Node 4: {2, 6, 8, 9}
Node 5: {0, 3, 9}
Node 6: {0, 4}
Node 7: {2}
Node 8: {1, 4}
Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 5}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 16 3-stars in the graph: \([16]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 8)>
3. <4, (2, 6, 8)>
4. <9, (0, 1, 5)>
