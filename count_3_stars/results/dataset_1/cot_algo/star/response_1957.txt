Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 6, 7
Node 1: 3, 7
Node 2: 5
Node 3: 1
Node 4: 6, 9
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 0, 4, 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 6
Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and find the number of 3-stars around them:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors
Node 1 has 2 neighbors
Node 2 has 1 neighbor
Node 3 has 1 neighbor
Node 4 has 2 neighbors
Node 5 has 1 neighbor
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star
Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Thus, there are a total of 2 3-stars in this graph, which are:

<[6, 2] (6, 0, 7)> 
<[7, 1] (7, 0, 6)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
