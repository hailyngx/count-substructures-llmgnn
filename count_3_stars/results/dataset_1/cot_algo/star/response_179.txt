Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graph can be found by listing the neighbors for each node and then identifying any 3-stars that can be formed. 

For node 0: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
For node 1: Neighbors are 0, 5, 8, 9
For node 3: Neighbors are 4, 5
For node 4: Neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 7
For node 5: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
For node 6: Neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
For node 7: Neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
For node 8: Neighbors are 1, 5, 7, 9
For node 9: Neighbors are 1, 6, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star
Node 1 forms 1 3-star
Node 4 forms 1 3-star
Node 5 forms 1 3-star
Node 6 forms 1 3-star
Node 7 forms 1 3-star
Node 8 forms 1 3-star

Thus, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>
