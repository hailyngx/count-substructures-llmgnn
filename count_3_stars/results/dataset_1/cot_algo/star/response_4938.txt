Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 35 + 10 = 55, so we'll put this final number inside brackets [].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>

This is the final result for the 3-star graph with the given nodes and edges.
