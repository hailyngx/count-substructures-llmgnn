Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 9
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed with Node 0
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed with Node 1
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed with Node 2
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed with Node 3
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed with Node 5
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed with Node 6
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed with Node 9

Adding these up, we have a total of \(4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 40\) 3-stars in this graph. 
So the final answer is [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
