Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 7}

Now, we can find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 15 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
