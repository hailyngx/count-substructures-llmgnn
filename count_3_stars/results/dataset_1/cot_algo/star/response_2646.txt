Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2
- Node 4: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, we need to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 4 also has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [45], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
