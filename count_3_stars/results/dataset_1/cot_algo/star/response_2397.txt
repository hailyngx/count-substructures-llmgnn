Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbor set for each node is as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are a total of 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 23 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [23].
The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
