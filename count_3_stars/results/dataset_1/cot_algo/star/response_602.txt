Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {5, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 forms four 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
