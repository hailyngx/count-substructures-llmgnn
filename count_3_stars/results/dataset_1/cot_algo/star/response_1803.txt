Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 6: {2, 3}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 7}

Now, we'll check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 35 \)

Therefore, the final result is [35] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <3, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (3, 7, 8)>
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 7)>
