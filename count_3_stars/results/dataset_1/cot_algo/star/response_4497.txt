Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 6

Now we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: 
  - <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, 
  - <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>.

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: 
  - <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>.

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: 
  - <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 3-stars, which can be represented as:

[18]
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>.
