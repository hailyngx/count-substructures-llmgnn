Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1, which can be represented as [1].

The unique 3-star found is <5, (2, 4, 7)>.
