Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
Node 1: 0, 8
Node 2: 0, 3, 7
Node 3: 0, 2
Node 4: 5, 7
Node 5: 0, 4, 9
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 2, 4
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 5

Nodes 6, 8 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 1 = 12.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 7, 4)>
<5, (4, 9, 0)>
