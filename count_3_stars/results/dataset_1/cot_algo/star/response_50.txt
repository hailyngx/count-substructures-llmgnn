Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's determine the number of 3-stars and list them.

## Step 1: Find Neighbors for Each Node
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}

## Step 2: Identify Nodes with 3 or More Neighbors
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9

## Step 3: Count the Number of 3-Stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33

## Step 4: List the Unique 3-Stars
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 0, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 33, and the unique 3-stars are as listed above.
