Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 6}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 16]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (2, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 9, 7)>
- <6, (7, 2, 5)>
