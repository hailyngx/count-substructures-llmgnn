Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with \(inom{n}{3}\):
- Node 0: \(inom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 1: \(inom{5}{3}\) = 10
- Node 3: \(inom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 4: \(inom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 6: \(inom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 8: \(inom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>.
