Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}

Next, we will check for each node if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star <9, (1, 8, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 8, 0)>
