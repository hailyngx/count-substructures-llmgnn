Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 9
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 8
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, there are 22 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
