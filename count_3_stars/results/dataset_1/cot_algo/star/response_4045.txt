Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 8, Node 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>.
