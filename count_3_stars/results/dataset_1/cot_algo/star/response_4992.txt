Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms 2 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 5)> and <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (2, 6, 7)>

Overall, there are 5 3-stars formed in the graph, so the final answer is [5].
