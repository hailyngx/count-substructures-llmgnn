Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 9
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 and Node 5 have 3 or more neighbors, so they each form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 35 = 37, which we'll put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>,
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>,
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>,
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>,
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>,
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>,
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>,
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>,
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
