Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 8
Node 1 neighbors: 3, 5
Node 2 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5
Node 4 neighbors: 2, 5
Node 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 7
Node 7 neighbors: 6
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 8

Next, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 16 3-stars in this graph. Listing them, we get:

<[2, 0, 8], [2, 1, 5], [2, 3, 5], [2, 4, 5], [2, 6, 7], [2, 8, 9], [3, 1, 5], [5, 1, 2], [5, 2, 3], [5, 2, 4], [8, 0, 2]>
