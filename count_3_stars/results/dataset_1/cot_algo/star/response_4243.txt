Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided for the graph, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 4
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 4, 7
- Node 4: Neighbors are 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 4
- Node 6: Neighbor is 8
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 3
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 6
- Node 9: Neighbor is 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 7)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
No other nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 5, 7)> and <3, (1, 4, 7)>.
