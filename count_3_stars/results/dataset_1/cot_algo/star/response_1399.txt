Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1], and the unique 3-star is <0, (4, 5, 8)>.
