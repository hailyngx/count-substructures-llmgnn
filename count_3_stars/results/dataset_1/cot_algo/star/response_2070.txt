Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 3, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 6
- Node 2: Neighbor is 3
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: Neighbors are 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 3, 4
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: Neighbor is 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>.
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>.
- Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 4)>, <6, (1, 9, 4)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>.
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 4)>, <9, (0, 7, 4)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>.

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [29]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 4)>, <6, (1, 9, 4)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 4)>, <9, (0, 7, 4)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>.
