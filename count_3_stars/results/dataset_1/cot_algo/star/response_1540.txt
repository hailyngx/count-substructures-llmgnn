Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6
- Node 9: 5

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for the formation of 3-stars:

- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using the inom{n}{3} formula:

- For Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:

<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
