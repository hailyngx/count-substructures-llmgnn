Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 4, 9. So, we have <2, (3, 4, 9)>.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 7, 9. So, we have <3, (2, 7, 9)>.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, 7. So, we have <6, (4, 5, 7)>.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 6, 9. So, we have <7, (3, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
