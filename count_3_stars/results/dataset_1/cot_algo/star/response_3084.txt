Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 6, 8
Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 5
Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 5, 7
Node 3: Neighbors are 5, 6
Node 4: Neighbors are 5, 6
Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 8
Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 9
Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 5, 6
Node 9: Neighbors are 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 6, 8 <0, (2, 6, 8)>
Node 2: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, 5 <2, (0, 1, 5)>
Node 5: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 8 <5, (1, 2, 8)>
Node 6: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, 4 <6, (0, 3, 4)>
Node 8: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 5, 6 <8, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>.
