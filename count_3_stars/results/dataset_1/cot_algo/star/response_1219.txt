Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to node 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 13 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (8, 9, 2)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (9, 6, 1)>
<8, (9, 6, 3)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
