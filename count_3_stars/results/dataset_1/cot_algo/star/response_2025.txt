Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (3-star formed)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (3-star formed)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (3-star formed)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (3-star formed)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (3-star formed)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [5] \]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>
