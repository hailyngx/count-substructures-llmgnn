Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 5, 7}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- From the neighbor sets, nodes 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.
- Calculating the number of 3-stars:
  - Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17] and the unique 3-star configurations are:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>.
