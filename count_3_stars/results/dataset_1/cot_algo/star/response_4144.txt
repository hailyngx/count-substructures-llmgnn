Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 7

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \([10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [22]\)

Unique 3-stars formed:
- <0, 3, 4, 5>
- <1, 3, 4, 7>
