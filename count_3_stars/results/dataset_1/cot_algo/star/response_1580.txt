Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 7}

Now, let's count the 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
