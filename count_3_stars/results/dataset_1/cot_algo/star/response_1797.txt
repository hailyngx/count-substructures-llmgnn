Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbor sets are as follows:  
Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 9}  
Node 1: {4, 7}  
Node 2: {0, 8, 9}  
Node 3: {0, 4}  
Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}  
Node 5: {4}  
Node 7: {1, 4}  
Node 8: {2, 9}  
Node 9: {0, 2, 8}  

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:  
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
\[ [4 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [16] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (2, 4, 9)>  
<0, (3, 4, 5)>  
<0, (3, 4, 7)>  
<0, (4, 5, 7)>  
<2, (0, 8, 9)>  
<4, (0, 1, 3)>  
<4, (0, 1, 5)>  
<4, (0, 1, 7)>  
<4, (0, 3, 5)>  
<4, (0, 3, 7)>  
<4, (0, 5, 7)>  
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
