Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7. Therefore, the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
