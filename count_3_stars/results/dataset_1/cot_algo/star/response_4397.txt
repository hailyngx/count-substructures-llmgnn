Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Calculating the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (7, 8, 9)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (2, 7)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 7)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (6, 8)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (7, 9)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (3, 4, 7, 8)
- Node 7: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 6)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 8)

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

- Node 0: 1 3-star with neighbors (7, 8, 9)
- Node 2: 1 3-star with neighbors (1, 3, 7)
- Node 3: 1 3-star with neighbors (2, 6, 7)
- Node 6: 1 3-star with neighbors (3, 4, 8)
- Node 8: 1 3-star with neighbors (0, 6, 9)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>.
