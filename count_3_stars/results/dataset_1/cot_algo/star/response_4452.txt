Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors = {2, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors = {2}
- Node 2: neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors = {4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors = {0, 3, 4}
- Node 6: neighbors = {4}
- Node 7: neighbors = {2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors = {2, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors = {4}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 8} <2, (7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 6, 9} <4, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
