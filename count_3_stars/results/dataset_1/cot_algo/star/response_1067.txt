Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 1 as center.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 8 as center.

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 3, 9)>, and <8, (2, 5, 9)>.
