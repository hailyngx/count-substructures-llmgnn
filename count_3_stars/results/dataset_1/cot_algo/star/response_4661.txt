Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes (2, 4, 6), so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes (0, 1, 4), (0, 4, 8), so there are 2 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes (0, 2, 1), (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 7), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 7), (3, 2, 7), so there are 6 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 2 + 6 = 9], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 1)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (3, 2, 7)>.
