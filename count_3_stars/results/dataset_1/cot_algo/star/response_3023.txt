Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {3, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, let's identify 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 0)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [10]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 0)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
