Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 5, 6}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {5, 6, 8}

Counting the 3-stars formed, we have a total of [2] 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are <1, (4, 5, 6)> and <3, (5, 6, 8)>.
