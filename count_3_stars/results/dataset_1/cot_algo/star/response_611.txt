Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 1: {4, 7}
Node 2: {0, 4, 7}
Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 9}
Node 5: {0, 7, 8, 9}
Node 6: {8, 9}
Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 5}
Node 8: {0, 5, 6}
Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9} has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars. 
Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 9} has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
Node 5: {0, 7, 8, 9} has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 5} has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 6} has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36. 

Therefore, the final answer is [36] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>.
