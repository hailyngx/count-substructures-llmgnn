Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 6

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- Node 7: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 = 5
So, the final answer is [5].

The 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>
