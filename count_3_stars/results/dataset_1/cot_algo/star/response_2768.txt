Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1, 7, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 5: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (3, 5, 7)>
- <9, (3, 6, 5)>
- <9, (3, 7, 5)>
- <9, (5, 7, 9)>
- <9, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (7, 2, 9)>
