Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 0, 2
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of.

For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0
For node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 9

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 2, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 4)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 8, 4)>, <0, (5, 8, 6)>.
