Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 1, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5

Now, we check which nodes have three or more neighbors, and how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors -> [1 3-stars], Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 1: 3 neighbors -> [1 3-stars], Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 3: 3 neighbors -> [1 3-stars], Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 4: 5 neighbors -> [10 3-stars], Total 3-stars: [1 + 10 = 11]
- Node 5: 5 neighbors -> [10 3-stars], Total 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 1 = 12]
- Node 7: 4 neighbors -> [4 3-stars], Total 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 16]
- Node 8: 5 neighbors -> [10 3-stars], Total 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 26]
- Node 9: 3 neighbors -> [1 3-stars], Total 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 27]

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [27], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>.
