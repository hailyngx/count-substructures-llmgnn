Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2}
- Node 1: neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {7}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 3, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 5, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 7, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 8, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 3-stars, so the final answer is [20].
