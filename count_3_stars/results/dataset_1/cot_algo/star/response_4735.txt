Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Now, let's check for nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13

So, the total number of 3-stars is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (4, 2, 9)>
- <1, (4, 9, 2)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (3, 1, 4)>
- <2, (4, 1, 5)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
