Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 6, 7}

We see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we find that there are a total of \( [1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4] = [36] \) 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (6, 7, 0)>
- <9, (7, 0, 4)>
