Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 1, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 4, 5) <0, (2, 4, 5)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 5, 7) <4, (0, 5, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
