Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by the nodes:

- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 9}. Therefore, <0, (1, 6, 9)>.
- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Therefore, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 0)>.
- Node 6: It has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars as well. Therefore, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars identified gives us a total of [9].
