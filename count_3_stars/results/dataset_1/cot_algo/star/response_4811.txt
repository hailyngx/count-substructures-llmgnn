Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we can determine the 3-star structures present in the graph by analyzing the neighbors of each node. 

Node 0 has neighbors: 7, 8
Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 9
Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 6
Node 4 has neighbors: 6, 8
Node 5 has neighbors: 9
Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 4, 7
Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 6
Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 4
Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 5

Node 0, 6, and 7 form a 3-star <0, (6, 7)>
Node 1 and 3 form a 3-star <1, (3, 9)>
Node 4 and 8 form a 3-star <4, (6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
