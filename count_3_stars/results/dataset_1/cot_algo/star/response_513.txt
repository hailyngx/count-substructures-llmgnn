Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5}
- Node 1: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 6}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11 3-stars [11].

Unique 3-stars: <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>.
