Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 6, 9
Node 1: 3, 5
Node 2: 0, 9
Node 3: 1, 5, 8, 9
Node 4: 8
Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 9
Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 6, 9
Node 8: 3, 4, 6
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 39

Therefore, there are 39 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>
