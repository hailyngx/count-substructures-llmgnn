Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13, which we will represent as [13].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 7)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
