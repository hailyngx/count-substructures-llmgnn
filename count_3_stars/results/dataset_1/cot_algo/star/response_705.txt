Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 7}

Now, we will check which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 can form a 3-star with <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with <2, (3, 5, 8)> and <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 can form a 3-star with <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, and <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with <7, (1, 5, 9)> and <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with <8, (1, 5, 6)> and <8, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 8], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, and <7, (3, 5, 9)>.
