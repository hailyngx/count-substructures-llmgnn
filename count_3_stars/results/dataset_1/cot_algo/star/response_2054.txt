Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the neighborhood sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 8}

Now, we look for nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3]. The unique 3-stars are <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, and <8, (2, 7, 9)>.
