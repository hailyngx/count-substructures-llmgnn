Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (3-stars possible)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (3-stars possible)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (3-stars possible)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (not enough for a 3-star)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (3-stars possible)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (3-stars possible)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (not enough for a 3-star)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (not enough for a 3-star)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (3-stars possible)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (not enough for a 3-star)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
