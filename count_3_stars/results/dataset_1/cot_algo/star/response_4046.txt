Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 9)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 9)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (Nodes 1, 3, 4)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 2)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (Nodes 1, 2, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (Nodes 7, 8)
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (Node 1)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (Nodes 4, 5, 9)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (Nodes 4, 5, 9)
- Node 9: 6 neighbors (Nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, 8)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Since nodes 1, 4, and 9 have three or more neighbors, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 20 = 40 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final result is [40], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>.
