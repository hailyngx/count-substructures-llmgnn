Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {1, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0}

Next, we'll check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [10 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [19] \]

List of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (5, 7, 0)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 4, 2)>
- <7, (1, 6, 2)>
- <7, (4, 2, 6)>
