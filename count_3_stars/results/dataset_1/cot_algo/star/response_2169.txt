Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars. <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 9, 8)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Summing up: 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32]. The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 9, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>
