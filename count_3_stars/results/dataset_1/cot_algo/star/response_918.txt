Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total: 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
