Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors = 3, 5, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors = 4
- Node 3: Neighbors = 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: Neighbors = 2, 5, 7
- Node 5: Neighbors = 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors = 3
- Node 7: Neighbors = 0, 4, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors = 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: Neighbors = 7

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (7, 8, 0)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
