Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars in this graph, we first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbor {9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}

Next, we check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 4}
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 5}

There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
