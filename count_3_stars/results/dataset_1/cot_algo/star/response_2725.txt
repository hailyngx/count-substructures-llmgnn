Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we'll identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbor {3}

Now, we'll check the nodes that have three or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:

- Node 2: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 8: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star

There are a total of 4 3-stars in this graph, so the final count is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
