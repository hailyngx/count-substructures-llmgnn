Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8}

Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6 have 4 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Calculating for each node:
- Node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16]

Unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 7)>
3. <3, (0, 5, 8)>
4. <6, (0, 1, 8)>
