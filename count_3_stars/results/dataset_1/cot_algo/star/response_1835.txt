Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, and <8, (0, 5, 6)>.
