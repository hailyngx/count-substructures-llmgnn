Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Since we have the list of edges, we can construct the graph and determine the 3-star structures within it.

The graph based on the given edges is:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, we will determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {7, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 7}

Now, we will look for the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 8, 9) so 1 3-star is formed: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 8, 9) so 1 3-star is formed: <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 9) so 1 3-star is formed: <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 6) so 1 3-star is formed: <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  - <9, (1, 2, 6)>
  - <9, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (1, 2, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8, which we denote as [8].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>.
