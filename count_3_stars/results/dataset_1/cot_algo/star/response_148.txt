Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {1, 2}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph, and they are:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>
