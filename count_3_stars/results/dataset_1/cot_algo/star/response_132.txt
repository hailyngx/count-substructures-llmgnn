Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 6, 9}
Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 2: {1, 4, 9}
Node 3: {0, 4}
Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 8}
Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 7: {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 8: {5, 6, 7}
Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 9)>
Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 9)>
Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
Node 7: <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
Node 9: <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Since we have found 11 unique 3-stars in total, the final result is [11].
