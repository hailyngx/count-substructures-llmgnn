Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (0, 1, 7)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 possible 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (2, 7, 8)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (5, 7, 9)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 possible 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from Node 1) + 4 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 3) + 1 (from Node 6) + 4 (from Node 8) = 11 3-stars.

Therefore, the final result is [11] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (1, 2, 4)>
- <2, (1, 2, 8)>
- <2, (2, 3, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 6, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (3, 7, 8)>
