Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 1, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 5, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs that can be formed:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star subgraphs
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star subgraphs
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star subgraphs
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star subgraphs

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22, which can be represented as [22].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (1, 4, 8)>
2. <5, (3, 4, 6)>
3. <6, (3, 5, 7)>
4. <9, (2, 4, 5)>
