Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 9, 1}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
\[ [3] \]

Unique 3-stars found:
\[ <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 9, 1)> \]
