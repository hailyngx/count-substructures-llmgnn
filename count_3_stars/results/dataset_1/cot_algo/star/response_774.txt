Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-star structures in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node. Then, for nodes with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at that node.

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [4 + 35 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [68] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
