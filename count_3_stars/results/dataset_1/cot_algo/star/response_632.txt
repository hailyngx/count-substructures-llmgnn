Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 7: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 8: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0
- Node 9: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0

Adding these up, we have a total of 6 3-stars in the graph. Listing them out gives:

\[<2, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 9, 1)>\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \([6]\)
