Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: neighbors are 2 and 4
- Node 1: neighbor is 3
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 5, and 7
- Node 3: neighbors are 1 and 7
- Node 4: neighbors are 0 and 6
- Node 5: neighbors are 2, 6, and 8
- Node 6: neighbors are 4, 5
- Node 7: neighbors are 2, 3, and 8
- Node 8: neighbors are 5 and 7

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2, 5, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
