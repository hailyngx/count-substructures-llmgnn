Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 1, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 + 10 = 21. 

Therefore, the answer is [21] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 8, 9)>.
