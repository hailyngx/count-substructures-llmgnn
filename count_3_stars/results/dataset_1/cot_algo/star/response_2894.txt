Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbor {2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8}

Now we check each node with 3 or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>.
