Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {6}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, which we represent as [5].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, and <6, (2, 4, 9)>.
