Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the provided information about the graph, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 2 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 3 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 4 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 5 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 6 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 7 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 8 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
    - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 20] = 30.
