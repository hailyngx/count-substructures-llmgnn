Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are \(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\).

Now let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 8 and 9.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 4 and 9.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 3, 6.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 2, 6.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 7.
- Node 5: Neighbor is 8.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 3, 9.
- Node 7: Neighbor is 4.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 5.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 6.

Now we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:

Nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 6)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <6, (2, 3, 9)> and <9, (0, 1, 6)>.
