Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {1, 2}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <5, (1, 4, 9)>

These are the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
