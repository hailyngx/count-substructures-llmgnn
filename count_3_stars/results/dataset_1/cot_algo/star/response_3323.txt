Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 1: has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: 
  <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, 
  <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: 
  <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 7)>
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (4, 5, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [21]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>
