Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbor {9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor {1, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-star configurations:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 6}
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 9, 1}
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 8, 0}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 8}

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars, so the final result is [5]. The unique 3-stars are listed below:
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <5, (6, 9, 1)>
- <6, (9, 8, 0)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
