Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we can first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbor {8}
- Node 7: Neighbor {0}
- Node 8: Neighbor {6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3}

Now, we check each node that has three or more neighbors to find 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [9], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
