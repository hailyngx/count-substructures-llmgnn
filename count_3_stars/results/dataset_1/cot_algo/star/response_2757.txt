Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 5

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these together, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 17 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [17], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 4, 5>
- <2, 3, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 7, 8>
- <4, 5, 8, 9>
- <4, 5, 7, 8>
