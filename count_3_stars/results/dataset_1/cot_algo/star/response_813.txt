Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 9}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {1, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

In total, there are 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 16 3-stars in this graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>.
