Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 8
Node 1: 7, 8
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 4, 9
Node 4: 2, 3, 9
Node 6: 9
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 0, 1
Node 9: 3, 4, 6

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of [2] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are <4, (2, 3, 9)> and <9, (3, 4, 6)>.
