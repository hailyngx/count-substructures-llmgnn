Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node based on the provided edge list:

- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Now, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 4 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, and <6, (2, 5, 9)>.
