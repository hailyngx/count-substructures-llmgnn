Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 7: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, there is a total of [1 + 4 = 5] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
- <9, (7, 8, 5)>
- <9, (8, 7, 5)>
