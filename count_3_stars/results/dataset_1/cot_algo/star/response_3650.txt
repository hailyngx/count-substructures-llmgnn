Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list all the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 24

So, the final answer is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 3)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 0)>, <9, (4, 3, 0)>
