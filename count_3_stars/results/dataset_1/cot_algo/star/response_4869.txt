Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 2: neighbor {5}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 4, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate \( \binom{3}{3} \) for them.
   - For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7

Thus, there are a total of 7 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>

So, the final result is: [7]
