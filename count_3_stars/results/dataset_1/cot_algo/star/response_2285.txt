Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 2

Now, we can see that nodes 2, 4, and 1 have 5, 2, and 3 neighbors respectively which indicates that they can form 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10 + 0 + 1] = 11.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
