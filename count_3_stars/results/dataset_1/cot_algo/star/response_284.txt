Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars present in this graph:

- Node 1, 7, and 8 have exactly 3 neighbors each, so there is 1 3-star each with these nodes as the center.
- Node 3 and 9 have more than 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each.

For node 3:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars

For node 9:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \] 3-stars

Total 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 33 \)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33], and they are:
<1, (8, 6, 7)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>
