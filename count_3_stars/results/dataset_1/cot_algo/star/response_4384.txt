Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-star (has <1, 6, 8>)
- Node 1: 0 3-star (has <0, 6, 8>)
- Node 2: 4 3-stars (has <6, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 9>)
- Node 3: 0 3-star
- Node 5: 0 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star (has <0, 1, 8>)
- Node 7: 0 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star (has <0, 1, 6>)
- Node 9: 0 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, 1, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, and <0, 1, 6>.
