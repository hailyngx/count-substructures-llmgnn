Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format:

0: 5

1: 3, 5, 6, 9

2: 

3: 1, 8

4: 7

5: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8

6: 1, 5

7: 4, 5, 9

8: 3, 5

9: 1, 7

Now, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {5}
- Node 1 neighbors: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3 neighbors: {1, 8}
- Node 4 neighbors: {7}
- Node 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6 neighbors: {1, 5}
- Node 7 neighbors: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 8 neighbors: {3, 5}
- Node 9 neighbors: {1, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 \), so we will write the final answer as [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (6, 5, 7)>
- <1, (6, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <5, (7, 4, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
