Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 6}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 23 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [23], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)> 
- <1, (7, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 5, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
