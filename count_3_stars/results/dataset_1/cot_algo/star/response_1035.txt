Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 6}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, and count the number of 3-stars for each of them:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>.
