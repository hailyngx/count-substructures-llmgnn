Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8

Next, we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and identify the 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (2, 9, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10, and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 9, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>
