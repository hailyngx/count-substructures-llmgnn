Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}

Next, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- For Node 3 with neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <3, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <3, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <3, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <3, (6, 8, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us 10, so the final answer is [10].
