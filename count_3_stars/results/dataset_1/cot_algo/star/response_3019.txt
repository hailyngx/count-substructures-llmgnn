Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (0, 4, 7)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
