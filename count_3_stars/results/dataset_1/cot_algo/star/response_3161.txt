Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the possible 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
  <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>,
  <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14]
