Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find all the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 0, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Finally, putting the final number inside brackets []:
Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 1 + 1] = [12]

Listing unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
