Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3
Node 1: 0, 9
Node 2: 5, 9
Node 3: 0, 8
Node 5: 2, 8, 9
Node 8: 3, 5
Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 2, 2, 9, 5 forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (2, 5, 8)>
Node 5, 5, 9, 2 forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (5, 8, 9)>
Node 9, 9, 2, 5 forms a 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (2, 8, 9)>

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
