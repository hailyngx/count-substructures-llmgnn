Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>
