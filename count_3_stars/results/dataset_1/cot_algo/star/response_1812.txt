Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 7}
- Node 4: {5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {0, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.
   
For nodes with three or more neighbors, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up:
\( [4 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [16] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <0, (3, 6, 2)>
- <0, (6, 2, 5)>
- <2, (1, 7, 6)>
- <5, (2, 6, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- <6, (0, 7, 3)>
- <6, (2, 1, 7)>
- <6, (2, 5, 4)>
