Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, let's consider the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<5, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<6, (2, 5, 8)>, 
<6, (5, 7, 0)>, 
<6, (7, 0, 1)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 6)>, 
<6, (1, 6, 2)>, 
<6, (6, 2, 5)>, 
<6, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<6, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<6, (6, 8, 0)>, 
<6, (8, 0, 1)>, 
<6, (3, 5, 7)>,
<7, (6, 0, 4)>
