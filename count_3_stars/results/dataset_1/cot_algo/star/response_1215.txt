Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with its 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
