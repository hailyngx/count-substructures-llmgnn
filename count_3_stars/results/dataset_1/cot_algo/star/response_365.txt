Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13, which we represent as [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>

These are only some of the possible 3-stars in the graph.
