Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by finding the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 3: Neighbor {6}
- Node 4: Neighbor {9}
- Node 5: Neighbor {0}
- Node 6: Neighbor {3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 8}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 (1 3-star formed)
For node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0 (No 3-star formed)

Total 3-stars = 1

Here is the list of unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 5, 8)>

So, the final answer is [1].
