Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes {9}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes {4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes {8}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes {4, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes {4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes {1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes {0, 3, 4}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 2 choose 3 = 0 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 has 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 9 has 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star: <9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>
