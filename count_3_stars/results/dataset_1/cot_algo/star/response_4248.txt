Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7, and 8: <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, and 8: <5, (1, 7, 8)>

There are a total of [2] unique 3-stars in the graph.
