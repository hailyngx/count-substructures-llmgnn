Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, we can first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 1: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Next, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 9: <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 9: <8, (5, 7, 9)>

Since we found 3 unique 3-stars in this graph, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
