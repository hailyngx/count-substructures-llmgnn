Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star

So, there are a total of \(1+1+1+1+1+4+1 = 10\) 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>
