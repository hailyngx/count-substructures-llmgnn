Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8, which can be represented as [8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
