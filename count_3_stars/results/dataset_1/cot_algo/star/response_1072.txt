Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8

Now, we need to identify 3-stars by selecting nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is 5, which can be represented as [5].
