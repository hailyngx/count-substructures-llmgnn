Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we can determine the 3-star structures within the graph as follows:

Node 0 has 1 neighbor: 6
Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 6
Node 2 has 1 neighbor: 5
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 7
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 7, 8
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 2, 6
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 4
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 4, 9
Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 8

By calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors, we find the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

\( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 \)

Thus, there are 21 total 3-stars in the graph. Listing the unique 3-stars:

[21]
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
