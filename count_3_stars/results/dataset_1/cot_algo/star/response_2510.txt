Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 30
Therefore, the final answer is [30] and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
