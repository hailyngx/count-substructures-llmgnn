Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 3)>
- <3, (5, 4, 7)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
