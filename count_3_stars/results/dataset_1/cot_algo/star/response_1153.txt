Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>

- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
  <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 2, 9)>, <2, (5, 9, 4)>

- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>

- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 2)>, <9, (4, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [30]
