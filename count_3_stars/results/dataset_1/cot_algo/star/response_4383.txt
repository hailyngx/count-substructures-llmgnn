Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
      0
     /|\
    6 8 9
   /   |  
  3    7 
 /|   /  
5 |  1   
 \|/ |   
  2  4   
```  

For each node, we can find its neighbors:
- Node 0: 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding these together, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 23.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 6, 8, 9>
- <1, 2, 3, 4>
- <1, 2, 3, 5>
- <1, 2, 4, 5>
- <1, 3, 6, 7>
- <1, 3, 6, 8>
- <1, 3, 7, 8>
- <1, 4, 6, 7>
- <1, 4, 6, 8>
- <1, 4, 7, 8>
- <3, 6, 8, 9>
- <3, 7, 8, 9>
- <6, 7, 8, 9>

So, the final answer is [23].
