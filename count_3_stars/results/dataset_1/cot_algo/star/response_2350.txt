Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {7}

Node 1: {7}

Node 2: {6, 7, 8}

Node 3: {9}

Node 4: {8}

Node 5: {6}

Node 6: {2, 5, 7}

Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}

Node 8: {2, 4}

Node 9: {3, 7}

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [16].

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>
