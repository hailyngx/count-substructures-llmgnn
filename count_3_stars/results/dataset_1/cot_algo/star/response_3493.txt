Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 6, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Now, we will search for nodes that have three or more neighbors to find 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Putting this all together, the total number of 3-stars [ ] is 4, and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
