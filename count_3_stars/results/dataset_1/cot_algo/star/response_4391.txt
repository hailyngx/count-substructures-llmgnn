Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 1: 4, 8
Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6
Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 7
Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 6: 2, 3, 7
Node 7: 4, 5, 6
Node 8: 1, 5
Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: <2, (3, 5, 9)>
Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 5)>
Node 4: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>
Node 6: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 8: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
Unique 3-stars found in the graph are <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>.
