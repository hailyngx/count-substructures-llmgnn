Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 3 and Node 5 have 4 neighbors each, so we can form 3-stars with them.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars are <3, (2, 4, 5)> and <5, (1, 3, 4, 7)>.
