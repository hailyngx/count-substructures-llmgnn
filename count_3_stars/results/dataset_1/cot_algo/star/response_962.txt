Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {1, 5, 6}
Node 1: {0, 3, 8, 9}
Node 2: {9}
Node 3: {1}
Node 4: {7}
Node 5: {0}
Node 6: {0, 9}
Node 7: {4, 9}
Node 8: {1}
Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 8, 9)>
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
