Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

1: {4}
2: {3, 4, 7, 8}
3: {2, 4, 5, 6}
4: {1, 2, 3, 6}
5: {3, 6}
6: {3, 4, 5, 7}
7: {2, 6, 8}
8: {2, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-star patterns formed:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star patterns:
<2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star patterns:
<3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star patterns:
<4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star patterns:
<6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 6)>

Adding up all the 3-star patterns, we get a total of \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16] \).

Therefore, the unique 3-star patterns found are:
<2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 6)>
