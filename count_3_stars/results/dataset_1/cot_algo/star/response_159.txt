Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify any 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
- Node 4, 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
- Node 6, 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
- Node 7, 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
- Node 8, 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed.

The only node that has 4 or more neighbors is Node 3:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <3, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1, and it is represented as [1]. The unique 3-star found is <3, (2, 5, 7)>.
