Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5, 9
- Node 2: 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 1, 2, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 0: <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 6)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 1: <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 2: <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 7: <7, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7, which we write as [7].
