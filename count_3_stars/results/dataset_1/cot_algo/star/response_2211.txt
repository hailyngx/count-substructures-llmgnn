Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 3, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors (4, 5, 6) <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 5, 7) <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 5, 7) <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 8 forms another 3-star with neighbors (1, 5, 9) <8, (1, 5, 9)>

Summing up, we have a total of [3] 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, and <8, (1, 5, 9)>.
