Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 3, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 5) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (5, 8, 9) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 6) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [1+1+1] = 3

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
