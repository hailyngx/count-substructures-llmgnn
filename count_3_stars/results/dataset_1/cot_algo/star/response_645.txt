Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 1] = [9] \)

Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>
