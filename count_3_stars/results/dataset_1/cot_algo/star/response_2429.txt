Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 7, 9
Node 1: 3, 9
Node 2: 0
Node 3: 1, 9
Node 5: 6, 9
Node 6: 5
Node 7: 0, 8
Node 8: 7, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8

Next, we will identify the 3-star configurations:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 9, 0)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 9, 0)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
