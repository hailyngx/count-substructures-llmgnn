Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 3, 4
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 8
- Node 6 neighbors: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 2, 6

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

As none of the other nodes have three or more neighbors, they do not form any 3-stars.
Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us [20 + 10 + 10 + 10] = 50.
 
Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
