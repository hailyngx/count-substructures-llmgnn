Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Total 3-stars = 1 + 10 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 1)>
<4, (6, 1, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 2)>
<6, (4, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>

These unique 3-stars are each listed only once.
