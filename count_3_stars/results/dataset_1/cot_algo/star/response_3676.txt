Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 7 : 3, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 7

Next, we identify which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so we have 0 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so we have 0 3-stars with node 7.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star with node 8.

Therefore, there are a total of 10 + 0 + 10 + 20 + 0 + 1 = 41 3-stars in the graph:

[41]
