Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: neighbor {4}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 3, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
    - <3, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <3, (0, 4, 7)>
    - <3, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <3, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <3, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <3, (0, 7, 9)>
    - <3, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <3, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <3, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (0, 6, 9)>

- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
    - <4, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <4, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <4, (3, 7, 9)>

- Node 7 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
    - <7, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (3, 4, 6)>
    - <7, (3, 4, 9)>
    - <7, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 4, 6)>
    - <7, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <7, (1, 3, 4)>

- Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>
