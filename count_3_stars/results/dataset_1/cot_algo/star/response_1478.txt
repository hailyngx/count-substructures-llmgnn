Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 and Node 4 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 3-stars as well.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, and <4, (1, 5, 6)>.
