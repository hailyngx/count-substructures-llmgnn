Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, 7 <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, 7 <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 8, 9 <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, 4 <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, 9 <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 7, 8 <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
