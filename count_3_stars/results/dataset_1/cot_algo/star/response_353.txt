Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms 3-star with nodes {1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: Forms 3-star with nodes {4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Forms 3-star with nodes {6, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Forms 3-star with nodes {8, 9, 5}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Total number of 3-stars = 4

Therefore, the final answer is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (8, 9, 5)>
