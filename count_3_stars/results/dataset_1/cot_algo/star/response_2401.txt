Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 8}

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
