Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6, 8}
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 9}
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7}
Node 4: Neighbors {2, 6}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 7}
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
Node 7: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 8}
Node 8: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 24 = [24]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
