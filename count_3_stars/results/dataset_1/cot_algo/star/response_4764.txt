Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

For each node, let's determine its neighbors:
- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, 7: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 10 + 10] = 25.
