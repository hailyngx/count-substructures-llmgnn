Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the final answer is [23] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
