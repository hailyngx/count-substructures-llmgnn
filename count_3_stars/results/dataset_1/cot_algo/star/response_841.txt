Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up: 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 27. So, the total number of 3-stars is [27].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
