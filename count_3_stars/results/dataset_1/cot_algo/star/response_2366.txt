Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {7}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors

We will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is [29] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, and <7, (0, 1, 8)>.
