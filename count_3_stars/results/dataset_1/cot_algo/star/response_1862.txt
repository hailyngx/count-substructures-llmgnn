Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 = 5.

Therefore, the final answer is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>.
