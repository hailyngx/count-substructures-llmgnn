Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 forms two 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8)> and <9, (2, 4, 5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in total, which can be represented as [5] within brackets.
