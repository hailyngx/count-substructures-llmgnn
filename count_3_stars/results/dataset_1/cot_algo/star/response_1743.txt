Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 7}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 8, 9}: <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 9}: <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 8}: <5, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, and <5, (1, 2, 8)>.
