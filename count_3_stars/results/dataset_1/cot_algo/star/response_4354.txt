Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {3, 9}
Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7}
Node 2: Neighbors {7, 8}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5}
Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5}
Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4}
Node 6: Neighbors {1}
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2}
Node 8: Neighbors {2}
Node 9: Neighbors {0}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors: 4, 5)
Node 4: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
Node 5: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
Node 6: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
Node 7: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
Node 8: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
Node 9: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <3, (4, 5)>.
