Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 1: 2 (1 neighbor)
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0 (1 neighbor)
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: 6, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 4, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7, 8 (4 neighbors)

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (5, 8, 0)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 7, 8)>

There are 5 3-stars in total, so the final count is [5].
