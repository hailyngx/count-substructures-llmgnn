Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3}

Now, we need to find the 3-stars. 
From the above neighbor sets, we see that only Node 0 and Node 7 have 3 or more neighbors, and thus, they could potentially form 3-stars.

For Node 0:
- In any combination of 3 neighbors picked from {2, 4, 5, 7}, we get only one unique 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 5)>

For Node 7:
- In any combination of 3 neighbors picked from {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8}, we get two unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 2)> and <7, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 2] = 3.
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, and <7, (0, 6, 8)>.
