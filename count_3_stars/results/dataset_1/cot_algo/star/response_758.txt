Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (3, 4, 9)>.
