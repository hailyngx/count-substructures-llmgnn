Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 5, 7
Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 6
Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 6, 8
Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7
Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4
Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 5
Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 4
Node 9 has a neighbor: 0

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 [<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>]
