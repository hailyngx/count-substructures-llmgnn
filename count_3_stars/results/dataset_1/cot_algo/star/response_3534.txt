Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 9: <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 8: <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 9: <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, 8: <9, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
