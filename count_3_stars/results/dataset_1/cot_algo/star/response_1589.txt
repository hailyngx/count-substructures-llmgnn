Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes can form 3-stars:

- 3-stars with node 0: 
    1. <0, (2, 5, 7)>
    2. <0, (3, 6, 9)>

- 3-stars with node 6:
    1. <6, (0, 3, 4)>
    2. <6, (0, 7, 9)>
    3. <6, (3, 4, 7)>
    4. <6, (3, 7, 9)>
    5. <6, (4, 7, 9)>

Counting all unique 3-stars found above, we have a total of [7].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, and <6, (4, 7, 9)>.
