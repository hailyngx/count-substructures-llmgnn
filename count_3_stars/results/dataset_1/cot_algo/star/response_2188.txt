Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {0, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {0, 2}
- Node 7: {0, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 8}

We see that Node 0, Node 2, and Node 9 have more than 3 neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 1 + 4 = 9 \), so the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 9)>
