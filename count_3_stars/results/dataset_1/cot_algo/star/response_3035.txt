Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is calculated as follows:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8.

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 possible 3-stars)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 possible 3-stars)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 possible 3-stars)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 possible 3-stars)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 possible 3-stars)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 possible 3-stars)

Adding all the possible 3-stars together: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (6, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 8)>
