Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges provided, let's analyze the 3-star structures within the graph:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 4, 9
2. Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 5
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 9
4. Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 6, 8
5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9
6. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 3, 5
8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 5
9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 9
10. Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 and Node 4 both have 4 neighbors, so they each contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 and Node 5 both have 5 neighbors, so they each contribute \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of 48 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found: 
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)> 

So, the final answer is [48].
