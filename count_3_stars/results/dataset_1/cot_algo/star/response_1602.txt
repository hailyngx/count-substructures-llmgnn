Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].
