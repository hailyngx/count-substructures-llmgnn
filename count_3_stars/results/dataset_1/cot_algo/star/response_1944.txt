Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges described, we first need to find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 = 5 \)

Therefore, the final result is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>
