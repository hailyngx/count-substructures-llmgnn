Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the specified graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 7

Now we need to identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
