Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   0 -- 2    4 -- 6
   |         | /
   9         7
             |
             5 -- 8
             |
             1
             |
             3
```

After exploring all the neighbor nodes for each node, we find that:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 6, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 5
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 4, 6) and another 3-star with neighbors (4, 6, 9).
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (6, 5, 7).

Therefore, we have [3] total 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 5, 7)>
