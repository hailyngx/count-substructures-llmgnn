Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 2: neighbor {5}
- Node 3: neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbor {}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 6, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 0 3-star
- Node 1: 0 3-star
- Node 2: 0 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: 0 3-star
- Node 5: 0 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 7: 0 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 9: 0 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [2] 
The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>
