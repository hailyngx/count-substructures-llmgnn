Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Next, let's find how many 3-stars can be formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the answer is [24]. The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <0, (8, 9, 2)>
- <0, (8, 9, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
