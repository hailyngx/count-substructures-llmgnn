Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 7}

Now, we need to find the 3-stars in this graph. We will look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars centered at those nodes.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, and <3, (0, 4, 6)>.
