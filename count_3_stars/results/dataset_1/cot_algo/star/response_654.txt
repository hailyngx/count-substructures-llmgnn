Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 8 (Degree 4)
- Node 1: 3 (Degree 1)
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9 (Degree 5)
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 8 (Degree 4)
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 9 (Degree 4)
- Node 5: 6, 8 (Degree 2)
- Node 6: 5, 7, 9 (Degree 3)
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6 (Degree 3)
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 9 (Degree 4)
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 8 (Degree 4)

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with (2, 4, 7)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with (0, 4, 7) and (0, 4, 9)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with (0, 2, 3) and (2, 9, 0)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with (5, 7, 9)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with (0, 3, 5)

The total number of 3-stars is [5].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 7), (2, 4, 9), (4, 6, 9), (6, 5, 7), (0, 3, 5)>.
