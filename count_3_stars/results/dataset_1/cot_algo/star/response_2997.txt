Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 6
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 6
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, 9
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, 9

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>.
