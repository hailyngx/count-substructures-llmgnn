Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 5, 8
Node 1: 2, 6, 7
Node 2: 1, 4, 7, 9
Node 4: 2, 6
Node 5: 0, 7
Node 6: 1, 4
Node 7: 1, 2, 5
Node 8: 0
Node 9: 2

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: (1, 2, 7)
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: (2, 1, 4), (2, 1, 7), (2, 4, 7), (2, 7, 9)
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: (1, 2, 7)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6, so the final answer is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are <(1, 2, 7), (2, 1, 4), (2, 1, 7), (2, 4, 7), (2, 7, 9)>.
