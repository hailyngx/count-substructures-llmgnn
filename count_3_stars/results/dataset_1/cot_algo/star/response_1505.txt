Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 9
- Node 6: 3
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 3)>, <9, (5, 8, 3)>, <9, (0, 8, 3)>.

Putting them together, we have a total of 8 unique 3-stars, and the final answer is [8]. The unique 3-stars are <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 3)>, <9, (5, 8, 3)>, <9, (0, 8, 3)>.
