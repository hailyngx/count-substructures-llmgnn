Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's first analyze the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 4, 7
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 4
- Node 2 has neighbors: 4
- Node 3 has neighbors: 6, 8
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 4, 5, 8

Now, we will check for each node that has 3 or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 three-star: <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-stars: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 three-star: <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1] = 6, and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>.
