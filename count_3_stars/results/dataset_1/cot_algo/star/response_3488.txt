Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 9
Node 1: 7, 8, 9
Node 2: 5, 6, 9
Node 3: 4, 7
Node 4: 0, 3, 8
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 2, 9
Node 7: 1, 3
Node 8: 1, 4
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>.
