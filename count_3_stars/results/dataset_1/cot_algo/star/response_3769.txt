Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- For node 0: Since it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- For node 1: Since it has 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
- For node 2: It can form a 3-star with nodes (0, 3, 5). So, <2, (0, 3, 5)>.
- For node 3: Since it has 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
- For node 4: It can form a 3-star with nodes (6, 9, 7). So, <4, (6, 9, 7)>.
- For node 5: Since it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- For node 6: It can form two 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 9)> and <6, (4, 9, 7)>.
- For node 7: It can form a 3-star with nodes (5, 8, 9). So, <7, (5, 8, 9)>.
- For node 8: Since it has 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
- For node 9: It can form a 3-star with nodes (4, 6, 7). So, <9, (4, 6, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
