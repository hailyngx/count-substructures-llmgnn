Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: 8
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <1, (4, 7, 9)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (0, 4, 8)>
  - <2, (3, 4, 8)>
  - <2, (4, 8, 8)>
  - <2, (4, 5, 8)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <4, (1, 2, 8)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (2, 4, 5)>
  - <8, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <8, (2, 5, 7)>
  - <8, (4, 5, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 10, and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, and <8, (4, 5, 7)>.
