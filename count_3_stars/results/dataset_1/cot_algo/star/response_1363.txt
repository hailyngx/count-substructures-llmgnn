Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node (with 3 or more neighbors):
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars formed: [1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [17]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
