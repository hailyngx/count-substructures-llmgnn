Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 2: 3, 4, 8
Node 3: 2, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 6
Node 6: 4, 5, 8
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 8
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
Node 9: 0, 1, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>.
