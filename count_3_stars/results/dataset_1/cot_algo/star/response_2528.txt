Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 8}
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
Node 3: Neighbors {6, 7}
Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 9}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 9}
Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 4}
Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 8}
Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}
Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:

Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
<Node 1, (2, 5, 9)>, <Node 1, (6, 7, 8)>, <Node 1, (5, 7, 9)>, <Node 1, (5, 8, 9)>

Node 4: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
<Node 4, (0, 6, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 = 5], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>.
