Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 8

Now, let's find all the 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed (has 5 neighbors)
- Node 2: <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed (has 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>
