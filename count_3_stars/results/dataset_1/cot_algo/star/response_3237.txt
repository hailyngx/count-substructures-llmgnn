Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 2}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 13 3-stars in the graph: [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 2)>
