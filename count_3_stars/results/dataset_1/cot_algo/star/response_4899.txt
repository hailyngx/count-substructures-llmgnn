Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 8}
Node 1: {6, 7}
Node 2: {4, 9}
Node 3: {0, 4, 8}
Node 4: {2, 3, 5}
Node 5: {4, 9}
Node 6: {1, 8}
Node 7: {1, 9}
Node 8: {0, 3, 6}
Node 9: {2, 5, 7}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

Node 3, Node 4, Node 8, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars: 4

Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
