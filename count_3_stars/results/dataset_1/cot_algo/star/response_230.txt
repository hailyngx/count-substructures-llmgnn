Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up, we have a total of \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 7 \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 8, 3)>
- <7, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
