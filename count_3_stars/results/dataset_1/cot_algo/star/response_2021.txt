Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 7, 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 7: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, which we write as [6].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, and the 4 unique 3-stars associated with node 6 as listed above.
