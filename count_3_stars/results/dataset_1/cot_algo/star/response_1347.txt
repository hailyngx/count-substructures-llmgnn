Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these results, we have a total of \( [1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4] = [20] \) 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
