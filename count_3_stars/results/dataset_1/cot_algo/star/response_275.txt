Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 20 (from node 8) + 20 (from node 9) = 43

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [43], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>.
