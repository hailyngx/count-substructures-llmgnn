Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 7
Node 1: 2, 3, 4
Node 2: 1, 9
Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 6: 3, 5, 7
Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 8: 4, 5, 7
Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4)
Node 3: (3, 5, 9)

Counting the number of unique 3-stars formed:

1 3-star is formed with node 1.
2 3-stars are formed with node 3.

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 4>
<3, 5, 9>
