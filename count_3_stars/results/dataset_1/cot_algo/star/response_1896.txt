Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {5, 7}
Node 2 neighbors: {3, 9}
Node 3 neighbors: {2}
Node 4 neighbors: {5, 8}
Node 5 neighbors: {0, 4}
Node 7 neighbors: {0}
Node 8 neighbors: {4, 9}
Node 9 neighbors: {2, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes 3 and 7:

Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: [0].

Therefore, the graph does not contain any 3-stars.
