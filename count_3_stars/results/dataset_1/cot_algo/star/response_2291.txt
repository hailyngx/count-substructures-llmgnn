Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's first find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph based on the combinatorial calculation for nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 20.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 1)>, <2, (0, 5, 1)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 4)>, <7, (2, 8, 0)>, <7, (2, 8, 1)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 1)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 1)>, <8, (4, 7, 2)>.

So, the final answer is [20] and the unique 3-stars are as listed above.
