Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is:
\[ [20 + 10 + 4 + 10] = 44 \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
