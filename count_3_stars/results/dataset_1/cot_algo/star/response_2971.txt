Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 9
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 23 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <1, (0, 2, 7)>
2. <6, (3, 8, 9)>
3. <7, (1, 8, 9)>
4. <9, (2, 3, 4)>
5. <9, (2, 3, 5)>
6. <9, (2, 3, 6)>
7. <9, (2, 3, 7)>
8. <9, (2, 4, 5)>
9. <9, (2, 4, 6)>
10. <9, (2, 4, 7)>
11. <9, (2, 5, 6)>
12. <9, (2, 5, 7)>
13. <9, (2, 6, 7)>
14. <9, (3, 4, 5)>
15. <9, (3, 4, 6)>
16. <9, (3, 4, 7)>
17. <9, (3, 5, 6)>
18. <9, (3, 5, 7)>
19. <9, (3, 6, 7)>
20. <9, (4, 5, 6)>
21. <9, (4, 5, 7)>
22. <9, (4, 6, 7)>
23. <9, (5, 6, 7)>
