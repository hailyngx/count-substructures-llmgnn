Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 5

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3 neighbors
- Node 2, 3 neighbors
- Node 4, 2 neighbors
- Node 7, 4 neighbors
- Node 8, 4 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of 10 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
