Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 4, 5

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, there are a total of 5 3-stars in this graph: <5, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 4>, <5, 8, 3>, <8, 1, 4>
