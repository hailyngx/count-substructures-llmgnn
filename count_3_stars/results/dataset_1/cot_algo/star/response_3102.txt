Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0, 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 1, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 53 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [53] with the unique 3-stars being:
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (0, 5, 7)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>
