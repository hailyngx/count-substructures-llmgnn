Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10] = 17. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>.
