Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 3

Next, we examine which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 and Node 6 have 5 neighbors.

For nodes with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) for Node 3
- \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) for Node 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
