Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars possible for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{{inom}}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{{inom}}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 10] = 14 \). 

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
