Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1] = 5

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
