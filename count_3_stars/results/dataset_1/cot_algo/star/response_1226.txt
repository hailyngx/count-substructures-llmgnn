Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-star graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges can be analyzed as follows:

Node 0 has 6 neighbor nodes: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 1 has 3 neighbor nodes: 2, 4, 5
Node 2 has 4 neighbor nodes: 0, 1, 5, 7
Node 3 has 3 neighbor nodes: 0, 7, 8
Node 4 has 4 neighbor nodes: 0, 1, 5, 8
Node 5 has 4 neighbor nodes: 1, 2, 4, 9
Node 7 has 4 neighbor nodes: 0, 2, 3, 8
Node 8 has 4 neighbor nodes: 0, 3, 4, 7
Node 9 has 2 neighbor nodes: 0, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

In this case, nodes 0, 2, 4, 5 have 4 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars from each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
