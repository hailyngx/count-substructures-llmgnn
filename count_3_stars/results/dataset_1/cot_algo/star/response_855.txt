Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 10.
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>.
