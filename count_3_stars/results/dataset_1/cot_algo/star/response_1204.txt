Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can begin by finding the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2}
Node 1: {7, 9}
Node 2: {0, 3, 4}
Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
Node 5: {3, 4}
Node 6: {3, 4, 8}
Node 7: {1, 3, 4}
Node 8: {6, 9}
Node 9: {1, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [21]

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 6)>

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the given graph.
