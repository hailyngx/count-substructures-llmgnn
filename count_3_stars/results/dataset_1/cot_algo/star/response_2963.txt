Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 1: 2, 3 (degree 2)
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (degree 7)
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 (degree 6)
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 7: 0, 2 (degree 2)
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (degree 6)
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6 (degree 4)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 2, 8, and 9 have 5, 7, 6, and 4 neighbors respectively, so we calculate \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 35 + 20 + 4 = 69 \) 3-stars.
- As each 3-star is unique, we list them:
    - <0, (2, 4, 8)>
    - <0, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 1, 4)>
    - <2, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <2, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <2, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <8, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <8, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (0, 2, 6)> 

Putting the final number inside brackets gives us: [69].
