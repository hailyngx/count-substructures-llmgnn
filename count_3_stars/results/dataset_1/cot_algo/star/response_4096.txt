Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes:
1 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 0, 5, 6>
- <2, 3, 7, 8>
- <2, 3, 8, 9>
- <2, 7, 8, 9>
- <3, 7, 6, 9>
- <6, 0, 1, 9>
