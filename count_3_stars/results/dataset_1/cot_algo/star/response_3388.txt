Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, and <8, (1, 2, 7)>.
