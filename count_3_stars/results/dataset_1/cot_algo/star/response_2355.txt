Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's explore the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {7}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {5}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 8: neighbors {1}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 5, 6}

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 31

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>.
