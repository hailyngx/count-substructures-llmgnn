Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {4}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 8, and Node 6 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [26] \]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>

So, the final result is: \[ [26] \] <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>
