Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbor {9}
- Node 6: Neighbor {2}
- Node 7: Neighbor {8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 5}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form potential 3-stars:
- Node 3, Node 8, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-star found is: <3, (0, 2, 8)>
