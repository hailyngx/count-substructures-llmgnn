Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
  <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7, so [7].

Unique 3-stars: 
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
