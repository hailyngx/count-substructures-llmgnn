Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's first find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 6, 7}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star (0, 2, 5)
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star (1, 2, 6)
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars: (0, 2, 6), (1, 2, 6), (2, 6, 7), (2, 6, 9)
- Node 4 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star (0, 5, 7)
- Node 6 forms 3 3-stars: (1, 2, 6), (2, 6, 7), (6, 7, 9)
- Node 7 forms 4 3-stars: (2, 6, 7), (4, 5, 7), (5, 7, 8), (6, 7, 9)
- Node 8 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star (0, 6, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 15], and the unique 3-stars are:

<0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>
