Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's first list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors

For nodes with 3 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0: 1 3-star is formed
- For Node 1: 1 3-star is formed

For Node 4 with 4 neighbors, we apply \( \binom{4}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars formed, which is 4.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 = 6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
