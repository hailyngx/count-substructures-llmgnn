Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {4}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 7, 8)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 8)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (3, 5, 6)> and <4, (5, 6, 9)>
Node 5 forms two 3-stars: <5, (2, 4, 6)> and <5, (4, 6, 8)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (4, 5, 8)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 8)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 5)>

Since each 3-star is counted twice (once for each node that can be the center), 
we have a total of 8 unique 3-stars. 
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
