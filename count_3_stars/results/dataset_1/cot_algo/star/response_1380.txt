Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 7}

Now, let's find 3-stars in this graph:
Nodes with 3 neighbors (possible centers of 3-stars): 0, 2, 5, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 4 + 20 + 4] = [29] \)

The unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>
