Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6

Next, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 2, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, 4, 6, 8>
2. <2, 6, 7, 9>
3. <9, 1, 2, 6>
