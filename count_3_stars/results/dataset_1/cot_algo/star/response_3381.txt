Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars, we have 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, and <7, (1, 4, 6)>.
