Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
