Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

For each node with three or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>
