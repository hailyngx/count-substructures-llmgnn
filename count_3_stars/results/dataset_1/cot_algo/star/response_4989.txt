Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 6, 8
Node 1: 3, 5
Node 2: 8
Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 3, 5, 7
Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 3, 5
Node 7: 3, 4
Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 9: 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, as they can potentially form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 3, 5, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
Node 3: \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
