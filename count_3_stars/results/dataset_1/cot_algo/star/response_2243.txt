Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 4

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars formed, we get a total of [7].
So, the unique 3-stars found in the 3-star graph are <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, and <5, (1, 6, 7)>.
