Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars each node is part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>.
