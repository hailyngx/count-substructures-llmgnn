Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (9)
- Node 1: 1 neighbor (3)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 8, 4)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (1)
- Node 4: 1 neighbor (2)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (8)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (2, 7, 9, 7)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (2, 6, 8, 6)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (2, 5, 7, 9, 7)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (0, 6, 8)

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [29].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
