Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of \( [4 + 20 + 4 + 1] = 29 \) 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
