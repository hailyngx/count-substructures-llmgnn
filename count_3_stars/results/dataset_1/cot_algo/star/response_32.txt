Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars centered at those nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, we have a total of 2 3-stars.

Putting the final count inside brackets []: [2]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
