Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 1, 6, 7

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

In total, there are 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 16 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 9, 7)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
