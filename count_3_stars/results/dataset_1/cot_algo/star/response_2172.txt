Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the graph's edges by each node:
- Node 0 is connected to node 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7.
- Node 7 is connected to node 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to node 8.

Now, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor set = {8}
- Node 1: Neighbor set = {2, 4, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbor set = {1}
- Node 3: Neighbor set = {4}
- Node 4: Neighbor set = {1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbor set = {6}
- Node 6: Neighbor set = {1, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbor set = {6}
- Node 8: Neighbor set = {0, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor set = {8}

Next, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors so that we can look for 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 4 have 3 neighbors each.
- Node 6 and Node 8 have 3 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Since each node with 3 neighbors contributes 1 3-star, we have a total of 4 3-stars in the graph. This gives us a final answer of [4].
The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 2, 4, 6>
- <4, 1, 3, 8>
- <6, 1, 5, 7>
- <8, 0, 4, 9>
