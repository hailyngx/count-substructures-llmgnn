Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To solve this problem, we will first analyze the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {0, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
  - <1, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <1, (4, 5, 8)>
  - <1, (0, 4, 8)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <5, (1, 6, 8)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <7, (3, 6, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1] = 6. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>
