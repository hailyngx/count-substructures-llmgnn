Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 9: {0, 5}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 3, and 5. For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 4 + 1] = 15 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
