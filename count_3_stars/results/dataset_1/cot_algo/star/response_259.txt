Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 1, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 8

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 6, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
So, the final answer is [6]

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>
