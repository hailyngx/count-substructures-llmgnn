Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

Node 0: 1, 3, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 5
Node 2: 1, 3, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 7
Node 4: 5, 6, 9
Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 0, 9
Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 8. So, there are [1] 3-stars with Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 8)>.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 5. So, there are [1] 3-stars with Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 5)>.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 9. So, there are [1] 3-stars with Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 9)>.

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7. So, there are [1] 3-stars with Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 5)>.

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 9. So, there are [1] 3-stars with Node 4: <4, (5, 6, 9)>.

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 9. So, there are [1] 3-stars with Node 5: <5, (1, 3, 4)>.

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 8. So, there are [1] 3-stars with Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<1, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<4, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<9, (2, 4, 5)>.
