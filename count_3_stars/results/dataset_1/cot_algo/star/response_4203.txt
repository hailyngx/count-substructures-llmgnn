Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

There are a total of 2 unique 3-stars in this graph:
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
