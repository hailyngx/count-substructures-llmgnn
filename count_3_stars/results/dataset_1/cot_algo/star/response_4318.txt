Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, and 9 have 4 neighbors each.

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 4 = 18]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>
