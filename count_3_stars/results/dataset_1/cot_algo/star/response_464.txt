Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, we will check for nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 14.

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
