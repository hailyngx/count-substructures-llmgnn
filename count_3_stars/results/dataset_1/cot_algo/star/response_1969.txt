Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 7}
Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
Node 6: {1, 4}
Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Node 8: {1, 5, 9}
Node 9: {0, 8}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 5 neighbors
Node 2: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 6 neighbors
Node 5: 6 neighbors
Node 7: 5 neighbors

For the nodes with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

Node 0: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
Node 1: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
Node 2: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
Node 4: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \)
Node 5: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \)
Node 7: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 74, and they are represented as:

\[ 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>
