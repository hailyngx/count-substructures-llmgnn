Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2 and 5
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 4, 6, and 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 4 and 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 3, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0 and 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1 and 2
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4, and 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4 and 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 3, 4, and 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, and <1, (6, 7, 2)>
- Node 2 forms inom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 1)>, <2, (0, 7, 1)>, <2, (1, 7, 4)>, and <2, (6, 7, 4)>
- Node 4 forms inom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 2)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 4)>, <4, (7, 8, 1)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, and <4, (7, 1, 2)>
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 2)>, <7, (1, 8, 2)>, and <7, (4, 8, 1)>
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars: <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, and <9, (3, 4, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars is [4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [32].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 2)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 2)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 4)>
- <4, (7, 8, 1)>
- <4, (7, 8, 2)>
- <4, (7, 1, 2)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 2)>
- <7, (1, 8, 2)>
- <7, (4, 8, 1)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
