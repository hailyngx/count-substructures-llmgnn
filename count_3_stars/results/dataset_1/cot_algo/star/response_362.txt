Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 1, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (0, 4, 5) => 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (2, 3, 7), (2, 7, 9), (3, 7, 9) => 3 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (1, 2, 6) => 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (0, 4, 8) => 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 6, so the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<(2, 3, 7)>
<(2, 7, 9)>
<(3, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
