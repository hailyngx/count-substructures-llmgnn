Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 20
Therefore, the final answer is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>
