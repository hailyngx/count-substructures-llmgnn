Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 6}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 (Exactly 4 neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 (Exactly 4 neighbors)
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 (Exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [1]

Unique 3-stars:
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
