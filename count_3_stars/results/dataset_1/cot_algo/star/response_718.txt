Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 6, 7}
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 9}

Since each of the above nodes forms a 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, which we will represent as [5]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 9)>
<6, (7, 8)>
<8, (6, 9)>
