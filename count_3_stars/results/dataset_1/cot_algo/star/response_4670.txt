Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

1: 4, 7
2: 7
3: 6
4: 1, 9
5: 9
6: 3, 9
7: 1, 2, 9
9: 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 9) = 5.

The 3-stars are:
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<(9, 5, 7), (4, 6, 9), (7, 1, 2), (7, 4, 6)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
