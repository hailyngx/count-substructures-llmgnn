Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 3}

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5, 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>
