Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 1: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 28 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
