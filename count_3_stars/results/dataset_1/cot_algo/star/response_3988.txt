Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 7 and Node 8 have 5 neighbors each.

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20.
Inside brackets []: 20
Unique 3-stars:
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
