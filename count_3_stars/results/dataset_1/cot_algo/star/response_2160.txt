Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, to find the number of 3-stars and identify them, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1 neighbors: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2 neighbors: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 5 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7} 
- Node 6 neighbors: {2, 7}
- Node 7 neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9 neighbors: {1, 3}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 62 \).

Therefore, there are 62 3-stars in this graph, and they can be represented as:

[<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 1)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 1)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>]
