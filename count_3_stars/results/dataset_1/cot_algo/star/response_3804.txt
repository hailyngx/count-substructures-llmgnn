Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor = 1
- Node 1: Neighbors = 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors = 1, 5, 6
- Node 3: Neighbors = 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: Neighbors = 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors = 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors = 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: Neighbor = 6
- Node 9: Neighbors = 1, 4, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars:
10 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 9) = 37

So, the total number of 3-stars is [37].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 3)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 4)>, <5, (2, 9, 3)>, <5, (2, 9, 4)>, <5, (6, 9, 4)>, <5, (6, 3, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 4)>, <6, (3, 5, 2)>, <6, (3, 4, 2)>, <3, (4, 9, 5)>, <3, (4, 9, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (9, 5, 6)>
