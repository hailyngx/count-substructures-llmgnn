Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbor {4}
- Node 2: Neighbor {5}
- Node 3: Neighbor {5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars and list them:
- Node 0: There are no 3-stars as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 1: There are no 3-stars as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 2: There are no 3-stars as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 3: There are no 3-stars as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 4: There are no 3-stars as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 5: There is 1 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 6: There are no 3-stars as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 7: There are no 3-stars as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: There are no 3-stars as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: There are 4 3-stars: <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] is 5 and the unique 3-stars found are: <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>.
