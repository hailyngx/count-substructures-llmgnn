Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 *inom{5}{3}* 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 *inom{4}{3}* 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8 3-stars

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 1)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 4)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 8, 1)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>

Putting the total number of 3-stars in brackets []: [8]
