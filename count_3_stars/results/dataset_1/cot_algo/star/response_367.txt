Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 6, 8)>
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
   - <1, (2, 3, 5)>
   - <1, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <1, (2, 5, 7)>
   - <1, (3, 5, 7)>
3. Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 4, 9)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>.
