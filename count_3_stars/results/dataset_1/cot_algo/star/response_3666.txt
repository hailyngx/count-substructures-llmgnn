Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 6, 7

Now let's list the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 8, 7)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (2, 4, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
