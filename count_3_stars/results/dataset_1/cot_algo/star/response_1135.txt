Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5, 9
Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 8
Node 3: 2, 4, 6
Node 4: 1, 3, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8
Node 6: 1, 3, 5
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5
Node 9: 0, 1, 4

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 7 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
\[ \binom{7}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 35 \]

Therefore, there are 35 3-stars in this graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (8, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (8, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
