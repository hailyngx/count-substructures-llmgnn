Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we will first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3}

Now, we will calculate the 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] is 6.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
