Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The adjacencies for each node are as follows:
- Node 0 is adjacent to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is adjacent to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is adjacent to node 1.
- Node 3 is adjacent to node 9.
- Node 4 is adjacent to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is adjacent to node 4.
- Node 6 is adjacent to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Node 7 is adjacent to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is adjacent to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 9 is adjacent to nodes 3 and 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 0: <0, (4, 6, 8)>.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 1: <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 4: <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 6: <6, (0, 1, 8)>.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 7: <7, (1, 4, 9)>.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 8: <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 15. So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 15.
