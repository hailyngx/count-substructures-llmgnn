Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 1

Next, let's identify the 3-star graphs:
- Node 0 has only 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has only 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has only 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has only 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has only 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has only 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.

Since no node has 3 or more neighbors, there are no 3-star graphs in this particular graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [0].
