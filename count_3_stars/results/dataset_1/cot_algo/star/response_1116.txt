Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 5, 6
Node 1: 2, 4
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 5, 7
Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 9
Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 7
Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 8
Node 7: 3, 5
Node 8: 6, 9
Node 9: 4, 8

Now, we can see that node 0, 4, 5, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>.
