Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
