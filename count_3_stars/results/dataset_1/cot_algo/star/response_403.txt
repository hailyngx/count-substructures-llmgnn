Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: neighbors {6}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: neighbor {0}
- Node 8: neighbor {4}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 6}

Based on the number of neighbors for each node, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6 have 4 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [22] \).

The unique 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
