Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 = 11, and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
