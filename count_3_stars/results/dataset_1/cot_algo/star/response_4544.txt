Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighborhood sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 6}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>.
