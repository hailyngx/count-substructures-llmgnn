Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 2, 3, 9
Node 1: 6
Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 4
Node 4: 2, 3
Node 6: 1, 7, 9
Node 7: 2, 6, 8
Node 8: 2, 7
Node 9: 0, 2, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 25, and we can list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
