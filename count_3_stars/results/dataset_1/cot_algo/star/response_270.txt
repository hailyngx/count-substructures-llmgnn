Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5

Nodes 0 and 1 have 4 neighbors each, therefore they each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \), which we can represent as [8].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 1, 2>, 
<0, 1, 3>, 
<0, 1, 4>, 
<0, 1, 9>, 
<3, 4, 6>, 
<3, 6, 7>, 
<4, 7, 9>, 
<6, 7, 8>.
