Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph by examining the neighbors of each node.

1. Node 0: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6}
2. Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 9}
3. Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9}
4. Node 5: Neighbors = {0}
5. Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9}
6. Node 8: Neighbors = {4, 6}
7. Node 9: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3, 4, 6, and 9 have 2, 3, 3, and 3 neighbors respectively, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
3. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
4. <0, (4, 5, 9)>
