Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 23 
The total number of 3-stars is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
