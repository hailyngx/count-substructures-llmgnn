Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 2
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 2, 3

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1+4] = 5. 

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>
