Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be described as follows:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 7.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5: <0, (2, 3, 5)>.
Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5: <1, (3, 4, 5)>.
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9: <3, (0, 1, 9)>.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 9: <4, (1, 6, 9)>.
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6: <5, (0, 1, 6)>.
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7: <6, (0, 4, 7)>.
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 1: <8, (5, 9, 1)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
