Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: Forms 3 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6, which we will put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
