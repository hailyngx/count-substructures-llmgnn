Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Adding them up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 40 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
