Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, there are a total of \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 35 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final result is [35] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 9, 9)>
- <6, (7, 9, 9)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 5)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 5)>
- <9, (4, 7, 5)>
- <9, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (6, 5, 9)>
- <9, (7, 5, 9)>
