Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 1: {4, 7}
Node 2: {6, 7, 8}
Node 3: {4, 5, 7}
Node 4: {1, 3, 8}
Node 5: {3, 8}
Node 6: {2}
Node 7: {1, 2, 3}
Node 8: {2, 4, 5}

Now, we see that nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, the final answer is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
