Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 7
- Node 9: 0, 7

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 45

Therefore, the final answer is [45] and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>.
