Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 8

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 9 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
