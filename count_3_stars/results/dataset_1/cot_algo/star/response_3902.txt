Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we will identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 1: {2, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 18 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [18] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
