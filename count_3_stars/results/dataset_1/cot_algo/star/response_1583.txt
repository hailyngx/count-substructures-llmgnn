Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 8}

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 2 and Node 9 both have 3 neighbors, so we have 2 3-stars formed by them.

The total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
