Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms one 3-star with leaves 6, 8, 9: <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms four 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (8, 9, 5)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star with leaves 4, 5, 2: <7, (4, 5, 2)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star with leaves 4, 5, 8: <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
