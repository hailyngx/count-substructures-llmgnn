Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves (2, 4, 6) <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 5, 9) <7, (1, 5, 9)>

There are a total of 2 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [2].
