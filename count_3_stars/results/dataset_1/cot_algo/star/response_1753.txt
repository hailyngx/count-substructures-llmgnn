Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 6 forms one 3-star with its neighbors {1, 2, 7}
  and another 3-star with its neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 3, 9}

There are a total of 5 3-stars, so the final answer is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>
