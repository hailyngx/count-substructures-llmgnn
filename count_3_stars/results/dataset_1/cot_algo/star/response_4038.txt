Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 0, 5, 7
Node 2: 5, 9
Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 4: 3, 5, 8
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4
Node 6: 3, 7, 9
Node 7: 1, 3, 6
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 2, 3, 6

Next, let's identify any 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 7)>
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 8)>
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 5)>
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 6)>
Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 17 3-stars: [17]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>
