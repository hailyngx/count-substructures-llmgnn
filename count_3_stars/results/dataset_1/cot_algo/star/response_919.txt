Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors = {2, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors = {1, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors = {2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors = {1}
- Node 6: neighbors = {8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors = {8}
- Node 8: neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with {2, 3, 8} <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with {0, 4, 8} <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with {0, 9, 2} <2, (0, 9, 2)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with {1, 4, 8} <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with {1, 8, 9} <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with {4, 8, 9} <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with {1, 2, 4} <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with {1, 6, 7} <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with {2, 6, 7} <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with {2, 4, 7} <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with {4, 6, 7} <8, (4, 6, 7)>

Since we have 10 unique 3-stars, the final result is:
\[ [10] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
\[ <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 9, 2)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)> \]
