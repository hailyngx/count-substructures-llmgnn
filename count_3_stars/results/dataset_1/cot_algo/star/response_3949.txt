Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 7
- Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: No 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: No 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 10 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-star (2 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (5, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 5, 4)>
<7, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (7, 4, 9)>
<7, (7, 3, 6)>
