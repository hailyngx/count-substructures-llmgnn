Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: [2]
- Node 1: [3]
- Node 2: [0, 7]
- Node 3: [1, 6]
- Node 6: [3, 7]
- Node 7: [2, 6]
- Node 8: [9]
- Node 9: [8]

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2 and Node 7 have 2 neighbors each, so they do not form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 and Node 6 have 2 neighbors each, so they do not form any 3-stars.
- Node 0 and Node 1 have only 1 neighbor each, so they do not form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 and Node 9 have 1 neighbor each, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 0 [0].

No 3-stars are formed in this graph with the given conditions.
