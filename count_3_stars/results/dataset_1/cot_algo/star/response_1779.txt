Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 ----- 3 ----- 6
    | \   / |   / |
    |   5   |  /  |
    | /   \ | /   |
    1       7       9
             |
             4
             |
             8
```

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors: {3, 5}
Node 1 has 2 neighbors: {5, 7}
Node 3 has 6 neighbors: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 4 has 1 neighbor: {7}
Node 5 has 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {3, 5, 7}
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 5}
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: {5, 9}
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: {3, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 5 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
Node 7 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40] and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
