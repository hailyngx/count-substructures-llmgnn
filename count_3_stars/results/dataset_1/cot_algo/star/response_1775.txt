Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5}

Now, we'll check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
