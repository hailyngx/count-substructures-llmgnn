Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbor {5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbor {0}

Next, we look for nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars. Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <2, (3, 7, 8)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <3, (2, 6, 7)>
  <3, (2, 7, 8)>
  <3, (6, 4, 7)>
  <3, (6, 8, 4)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <4, (6, 7, 5)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <6, (3, 4, 8)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <8, (0, 3, 6)>
  <8, (0, 2, 3)>
  <8, (3, 2, 6)>
  <8, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11] with unique 3-stars: 
<2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 4, 7)>, <3, (6, 8, 4)>, <4, (6, 7, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (3, 2, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>.
