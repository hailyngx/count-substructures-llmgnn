Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: \({3 \choose 3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3}\) = 4 3-stars <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 6: \({4 \choose 3}\) = 4 3-stars <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9, so the final answer is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>.
