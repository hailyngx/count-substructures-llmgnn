Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's establish the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 8

Now we'll check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 8 both have 3 neighbors, so each will form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can also form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10, which we represent as [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <8, 0, 9>
- <9, 8, 4>
- <9, 8, 6>
- <9, 8, 0>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 5, 1>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 7, 3>
