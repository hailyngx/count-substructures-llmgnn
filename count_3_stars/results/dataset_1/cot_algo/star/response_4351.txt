Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 7}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: 5 neighbors, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 6 neighbors, \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 38

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
