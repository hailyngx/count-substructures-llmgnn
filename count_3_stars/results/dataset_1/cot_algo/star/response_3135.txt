Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors so it forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors so it forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors so it forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors so it forms 4 3-stars: 
  - <7, (1, 3, 4)>
  - <7, (1, 4, 8)>
  - <7, (3, 4, 8)>
  - <7, (1, 8, 4)>

So the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7, which can be represented as [7].
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 4)>.
