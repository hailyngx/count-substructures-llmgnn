Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
  <0, (3, 7, 8)>

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
  <1, (5, 6, 7)>

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
  <6, (1, 2, 5)>
  <6, (1, 2, 7)>
  <6, (1, 5, 7)>
  <6, (2, 5, 7)>
  <6, (1, 5, 9)>
  <6, (1, 7, 9)>
  <6, (2, 5, 9)>
  <6, (2, 7, 9)>
  <6, (5, 7, 9)>
  <6, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 10] = 12.
