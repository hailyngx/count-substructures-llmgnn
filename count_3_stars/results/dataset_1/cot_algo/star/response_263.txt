Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 8}
Node 1: {4, 5, 9}
Node 2: {7, 9}
Node 3: {0, 4, 8}
Node 4: {0, 1, 3}
Node 5: {0, 1, 8}
Node 6: {7}
Node 7: {2, 6}
Node 8: {0, 3, 5}
Node 9: {1, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>.
