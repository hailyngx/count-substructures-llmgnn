Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 7, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star graphs formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (since it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (since it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (since it has 5 neighbors)

Total number of 3-star graphs formed: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in this graph is [19]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>.
