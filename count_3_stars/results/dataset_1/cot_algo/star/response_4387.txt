Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

For node 0, the neighbor set is: {3, 5, 6}
For node 1, the neighbor set is: {2, 4, 6}
For node 2, the neighbor set is: {1, 3, 4, 5}
For node 3, the neighbor set is: {0, 2, 6}
For node 4, the neighbor set is: {1, 2, 8, 9}
For node 5, the neighbor set is: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
For node 6, the neighbor set is: {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
For node 7, the neighbor set is: {5, 6}
For node 8, the neighbor set is: {4, 5, 6}
For node 9, the neighbor set is: {4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 6 can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
In total, we have 6 nodes that can form 3-stars. For each of these nodes, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \):
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 11 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8)>
