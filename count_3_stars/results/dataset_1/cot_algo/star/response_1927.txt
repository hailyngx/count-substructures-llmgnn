Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8: <1, (4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6: <4, (1, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8: <4, (6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8: <4, (7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 5: <4, (8, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3: <8, (1, 3)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4: <8, (1, 4)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5: <8, (1, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4: <8, (3, 4)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5: <8, (3, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7: <8, (3, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5: <8, (4, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6: <8, (4, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7: <8, (4, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7: <8, (5, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 5: <8, (6, 5)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 17 in total, so the final result is [17].
