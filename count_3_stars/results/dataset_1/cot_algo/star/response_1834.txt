Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}

Now, we'll check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star:
- Node 3, 6, and 8 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 *CRL*
- Node 1, 2, 5, and 9 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 *CRL*

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [13]

Unique 3-stars:
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (6, 2, 8)>
- <3, (6, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
