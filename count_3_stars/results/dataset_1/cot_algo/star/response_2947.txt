Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 3, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 20 + 4 + 4] = 29

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>
