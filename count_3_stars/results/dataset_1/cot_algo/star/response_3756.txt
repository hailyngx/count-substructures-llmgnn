Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {0, 7}
- Node 4: {6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] is 4.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
