Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

1: 2, 6  
2: 1, 3  
3: 2, 5, 6  
4: 9  
5: 3, 7  
6: 1, 3, 8  
7: 5, 8  
8: 6, 7  
9: 4  

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2 and 6: <1, (2, 6)>  
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 5, and 6: <3, (2, 5, 6)>  
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, and 8: <6, (1, 3, 8)>  

There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [3].
