Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its nodes and neighbors:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {5, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 8}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-star formations. We will only consider nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star formations
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star formations
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star formations
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-star formations
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-star formations
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-star formations
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-star formations

Total number of 3-star formations: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
