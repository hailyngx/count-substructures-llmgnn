Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8}

Now, we need to check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars. Nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the 3-stars for these nodes.

For Node 0:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: 
  - <0, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <0, (2, 4, 8)>
  - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <0, (4, 6, 8)>

For Node 2:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: 
  - <2, (0, 5, 7)>
  - <2, (0, 5, 9)>
  - <2, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <2, (5, 7, 9)>

For Node 5:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars: 
  - <5, (1, 2, 6)>
  - <5, (1, 3, 6)>
  - <5, (1, 6, 8)>
  - <5, (2, 3, 6)>
  - <5, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <5, (3, 6, 8)>
  - <5, (1, 2, 8)>
  - <5, (1, 3, 8)>
  - <5, (2, 3, 8)>
  - <5, (1, 2, 3)>

For Node 7:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: 
  - <7, (1, 2, 9)>
  - <7, (1, 3, 9)>
  - <7, (2, 3, 9)>
  - <7, (1, 2, 3)>

For Node 8:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars: 
  - <8, (0, 4, 6)>
  - <8, (0, 4, 9)>
  - <8, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (4, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <8, (0, 5, 9)>
  - <8, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (5, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Summing up all the 3-stars calculated, we have a total of 32 3-stars. So, the final result is [32].
