Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 9  
- Node 1: 7  
- Node 2: 0  
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 8  
- Node 4: 6, 9  
- Node 5: 0, 3  
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7  
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8  
- Node 8: 3, 7  
- Node 9: 0, 4  

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 9)>  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>  
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (4, 7, 3)>  
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>  

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10, so the final answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>.
