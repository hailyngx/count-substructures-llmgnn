Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 20] = [30] \)

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
