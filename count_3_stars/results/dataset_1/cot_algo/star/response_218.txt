Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {4}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {2}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 2)>
- <2, (5, 8, 6)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (2, 6, 5)>
- <8, (2, 6, 8)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
