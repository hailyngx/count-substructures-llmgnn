Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30

So, there are a total of 30 3-stars in the given graph.
Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [30]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 3, 1, 6>
- <3, 1, 2, 8>
- <3, 1, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 0, 6>
- <3, 6, 0, 5>
- <3, 6, 5, 8>
- <3, 8, 5, 7>
- <4, 9, 7, 8>
