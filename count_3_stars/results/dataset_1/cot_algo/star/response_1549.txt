Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are six nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. 

For node 0:
It has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 7
Number of 3-stars using node 0: [1]

For node 1:
It has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7
Number of 3-stars using node 1: [4]

For node 3:
It has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 7
Number of 3-stars using node 3: [1]

For node 5:
It has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 9
Number of 3-stars using node 5: [4]

For node 7:
It has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
Number of 3-stars using node 7: [6]

For node 9:
It has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, 9
Number of 3-stars using node 9: [4]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 6 + 4] = [20]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
