Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: does not form a 3-star
- Node 1: does not form a 3-star
- Node 3: does not form a 3-star
- Node 4: does not form a 3-star
- Node 5: does not form a 3-star
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: does not form a 3-star
- Node 8: [4]
- Node 9: does not form a 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 5.

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 3)>

So, the final result is:
[5]
