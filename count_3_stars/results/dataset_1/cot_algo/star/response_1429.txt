Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
   0 -- 3    4 
   |    |  / | 
   5 -- 1 -- 8 
     \      / 
       6 -- 9 
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has neighbors {3, 5, 6} -> [1 3-star] -> <0, (3, 5, 6)>
Node 1 has neighbors {4, 5, 8, 9} -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars -> <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>
Node 3 has neighbors {0, 2, 8} -> [1 3-star] -> <3, (0, 2, 8)>
Node 4 has neighbors {1, 6} -> [inom{2}{3}] = 1 3-star -> <4, (1, 6, -)>
Node 5 has neighbors {0, 1} -> No 3-stars
Node 6 has neighbors {0, 4, 8} -> [1 3-star] -> <6, (0, 4, 8)>
Node 8 has neighbors {1, 3, 6} -> [1 3-star] -> <8, (1, 3, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 8.
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, -)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>.
