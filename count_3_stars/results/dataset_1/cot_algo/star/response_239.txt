Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {0, 5}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [21], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>
