Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's build the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify which nodes forms 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 14 \) 3-stars in this graph. 

So, the final answer is: [14]
And the unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>.
