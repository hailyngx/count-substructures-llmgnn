Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighborhood sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 5, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 4, 8, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 5, 6
Node 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 1, 3
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 8
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 3, 7
Node 7 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 5
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7

Now we'll count the number of 3-stars:

For node 0, there is only 1 3-star since it has exactly 3 neighbors.
For node 1, there is only 1 3-star since it has exactly 3 neighbors.
For node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with neighbors {4, 6, 7}, {4, 5, 7}, {6, 5, 7}, {4, 5, 9}.
For node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with neighbors {0, 2, 7}, {0, 7, 8}, {2, 6, 7}, {3, 7, 8}.
For node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with neighbors {3, 5, 9}, {3, 6, 9}, {5, 6, 9}, {5, 8, 9}.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14 \), which can be written as [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
