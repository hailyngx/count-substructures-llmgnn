Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph using a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: [2]
Node 1: [3, 4, 7, 8]
Node 2: [0]
Node 3: [1, 4]
Node 4: [1, 3, 6]
Node 5: [6]
Node 6: [4, 5, 9]
Node 7: [1]
Node 8: [1]
Node 9: [6]

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( [4 + 1] = [5] \) 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
