Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 5) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {4}

Now, let's apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors.

So, we have a total of 1 3-star. Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [1].

The unique 3-star found is <3, (0, 2, 5)>.
