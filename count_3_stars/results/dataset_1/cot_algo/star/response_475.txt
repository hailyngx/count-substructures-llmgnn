Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows: 

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, and <0, (3, 6, 7)>.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, and <1, (5, 8, 4)>.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. The unique 3-star is <4, (0, 1, 8)>.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, and <7, (2, 3, 6)>.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. The unique 3-star is <8, (1, 4, 5)>.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. The unique 3-star is <9, (2, 3, 6)>.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23].
