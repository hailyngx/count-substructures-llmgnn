Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 1, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5

Now, let's check if any node has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- No other nodes have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>
