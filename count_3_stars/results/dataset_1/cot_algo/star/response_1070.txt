Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 6}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 6}
- Node 9: {7}

We can see that the nodes 0, 1, 2, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in.

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [13]. The unique 3-star configurations are <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>.
