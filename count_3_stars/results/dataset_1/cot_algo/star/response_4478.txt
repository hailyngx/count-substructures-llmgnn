Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we can determine the number of 3-stars using the method described earlier. Let's first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {2, 9}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
