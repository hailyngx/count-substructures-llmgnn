Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 7, 8

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 0 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 23, which we will represent as [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
