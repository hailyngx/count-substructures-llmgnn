Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will build the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 34 3-stars:

\[ [34] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
