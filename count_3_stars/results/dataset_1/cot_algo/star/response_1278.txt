Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 1

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1 and node 2 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars. 
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. 

Now, we need to calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2, and 3 can each form a 3-star, so the total number of 3-stars is 3.

Finally, we list the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, 3, 7, 9>
- <2, 3, 5, 8>
- <3, 1, 2, 6>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
