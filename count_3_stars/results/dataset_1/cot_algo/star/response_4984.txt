Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 1

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars each can form:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we have a total of [1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 23 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
