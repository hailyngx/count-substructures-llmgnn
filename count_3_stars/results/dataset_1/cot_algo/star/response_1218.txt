Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8, 9
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 and Node 9 have 3 neighbors each, so they form a 3-star. (2 total)
Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 8 have 4 neighbors each, so they each contribute \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars. (16 total)
Node 1 and Node 5 have 2 neighbors each, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2 + 16 = 18, which we will represent as [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
