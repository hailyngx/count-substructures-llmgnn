Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 -> {2, 3, 4}
Node 1 -> {4, 6}
Node 2 -> {0, 7, 8}
Node 3 -> {0, 9}
Node 4 -> {0, 1, 8, 9}
Node 5 -> {6, 7}
Node 6 -> {1, 5, 7}
Node 7 -> {2, 5, 6, 9}
Node 8 -> {2, 4, 9}
Node 9 -> {3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes can form 3-star graphs:

Node 0 -> Forms 3-star with {2, 3, 4}
Node 1 -> Does not have 3 neighbors
Node 2 -> Forms 3-star with {0, 8, 7}
Node 3 -> Does not have 3 neighbors
Node 4 -> Forms 3-star with {0, 8, 9}
Node 5 -> Does not have 3 neighbors
Node 6 -> Does not have 3 neighbors
Node 7 -> Forms 3-star with {2, 8, 9}
Node 8 -> Forms 3-star with {2, 4, 9}
Node 9 -> Forms 3-star with {3, 4, 7}

Count of 3-stars = 5
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
