Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighborhood set for each node. 

- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 6}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 44.

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
