Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 3: 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 5

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 = 12

Therefore, we have 12 3-stars in this graph:
[<3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>]
