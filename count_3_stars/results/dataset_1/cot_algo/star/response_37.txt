Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves {2, 6, 9}: <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 7, 9}: <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves {3, 6, 9}: <7, (3, 6, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
