Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {8}
Node 1: {2, 3, 7}
Node 2: {1, 3, 5}
Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 7}
Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 9}
Node 5: {2, 4}
Node 6: {8, 9}
Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
Node 8: {0, 6, 7}
Node 9: {4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 7)>
Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 7)>
Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
