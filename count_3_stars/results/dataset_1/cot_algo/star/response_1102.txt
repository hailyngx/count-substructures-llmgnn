Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7, so we put it inside brackets: [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
