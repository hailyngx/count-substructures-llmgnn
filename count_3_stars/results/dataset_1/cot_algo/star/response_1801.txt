Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {0, 7}
- Node 3: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
Node 4 and Node 5 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for them:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 = 11
So, the final answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
