Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 3, 5

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 

The total number of 3-stars formed is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 27, so we have [27].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 7), (0, 3, 8), (0, 5, 6), (0, 5, 7), (0, 5, 8), (1, 4, 2), (1, 4, 5), (2, 1, 4), (2, 1, 5), (2, 4, 5), (3, 0, 5), (3, 7, 5), (3, 8, 5), (5, 0, 3), (5, 0, 6), (5, 0, 7), (5, 0, 8), (5, 2, 1), (5, 2, 4)>
