Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent this graph visually for better understanding:

        0 - 2 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 1 - 4 - 9
                         |   |   |  
                         8 - 3

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 = 20.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
[20]
