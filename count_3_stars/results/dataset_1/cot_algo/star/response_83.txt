Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2}
- Node 6: {8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 forms one 3-star: <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (1, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
