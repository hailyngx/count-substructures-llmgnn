Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 5)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
