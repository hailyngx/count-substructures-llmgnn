Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 8

Now let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 5 (Total: 1)
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, 9 (Total: 1)
- Node 8: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 4 (Total: 1)
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 8 (Total: 1)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>.
