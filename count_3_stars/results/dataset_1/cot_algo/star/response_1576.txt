Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 6

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each of these nodes using \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Since each 3-star involves a central node and 3 leaves, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>

So, the final answer is [16].
