Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5
- Node 1: 3, 5
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 2.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 3.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
