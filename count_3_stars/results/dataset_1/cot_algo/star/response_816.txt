Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2

Now let's check how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0 and Node 2 both have 3 neighbors, so each can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 and Node 8 both have 5 neighbors, so each can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20] = [42] \). 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
