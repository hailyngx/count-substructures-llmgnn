Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 4, 7, and 8 have 6 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 \times 20] = [80] \). 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
