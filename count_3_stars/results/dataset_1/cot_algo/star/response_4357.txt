Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For Node 0, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>

For Node 1, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (1, 5, 8)>

For Node 2, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (8, 7, 5)>

For Node 4, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<4, (0, 5, 8)>

For Node 5, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>

For Node 8, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 8, 7)>, <8, (4, 9, 8)>, <8, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (5, 9, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get [10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10] = 39.
