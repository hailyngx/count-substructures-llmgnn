Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5
- Node 2: 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors which are nodes 4, 5, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, which we will represent as [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
