Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 9: 4, 5

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>
