Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 6)>
<1, (0, 9, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
