Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves {1, 5, 6}. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 7, 9}. <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 6, 7}. <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 5, 8}. <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves {1, 6, 7}. <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
