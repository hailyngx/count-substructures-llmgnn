Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each.

For each of these nodes with 4 neighbors, we can form a 3-star. So, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 6, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7, 8)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2, 9)>
