Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
