Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 8), so there will be \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 3 as the center. The unique 3-stars are <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, and <3, (4, 7, 8)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
