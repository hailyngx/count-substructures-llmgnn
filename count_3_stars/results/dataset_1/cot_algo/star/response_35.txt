Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 8: <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6: <1, (0, 3, 6)> and with nodes 0, 6, and 7: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4: <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 4 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <7, (1, 2, 5)> and with nodes 0, 5, and 8: <7, (0, 5, 8)>
  
In total, there are 5 unique 3-stars formed in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
