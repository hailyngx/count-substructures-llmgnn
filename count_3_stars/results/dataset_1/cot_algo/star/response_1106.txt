Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 (6 neighbors)
- Node 1: 9 (1 neighbor)
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0, 7, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 8 (1 neighbor)
- Node 5: 0 (1 neighbor)
- Node 6: 2 (1 neighbor)
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3 (4 neighbors)

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32] and the unique 3-stars are found as follows:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
