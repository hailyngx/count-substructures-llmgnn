Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will analyze the neighborhood of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 5}

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1, using \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 2, using \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 4, using \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [20 + 10 + 10 = 40].

Next, we will list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>
