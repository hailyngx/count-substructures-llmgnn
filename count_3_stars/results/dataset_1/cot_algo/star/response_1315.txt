Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's examine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: (1)
- Node 1: (0, 2, 6, 7)
- Node 2: (1, 9)
- Node 3: (5, 7, 9)
- Node 4: (6)
- Node 5: (3)
- Node 6: (1, 4, 9)
- Node 7: (1, 3, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (7)
- Node 9: (2, 3, 6, 7)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 6, 7): <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 9, 7): <2, (1, 9, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (5, 7, 9): <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 4, 9): <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 3, 8, 9): <7, (1, 3, 8), (7, 1, 9)>

Counting all the 3-stars, we have a total of 5 3-stars. So the final result is [5].
