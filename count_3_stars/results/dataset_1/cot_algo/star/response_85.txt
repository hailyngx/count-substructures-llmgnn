Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: neighbor {1}
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: neighbor {3}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 doesn't form a 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 3 doesn't form a 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 9, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 forms two 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 5)> and <9, (6, 8, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 9, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, and <9, (6, 8, 1)>.
