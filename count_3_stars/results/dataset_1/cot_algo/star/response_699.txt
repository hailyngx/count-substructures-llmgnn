Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 4 forms a 3-star as it has 2, 9, 7 as neighbors: <4, (2, 7, 9)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star as it has 2, 5, 9 as neighbors: <6, (2, 5, 9)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star as it has 0, 3, 5 as neighbors: <9, (0, 3, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: [3]
