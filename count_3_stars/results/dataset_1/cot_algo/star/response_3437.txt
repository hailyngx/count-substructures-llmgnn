Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 7, 6}, giving <1, (5, 7, 6)>.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 7, 9}, giving <2, (4, 7, 9)>.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
