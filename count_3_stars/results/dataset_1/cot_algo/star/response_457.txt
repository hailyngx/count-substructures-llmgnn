Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:

Node 0: {8}
Node 1: {5, 6, 9}
Node 2: {3, 5}
Node 3: {2, 8}
Node 4: {6, 9}
Node 5: {1, 2, 6}
Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 7}
Node 7: {6}
Node 8: {0, 3}
Node 9: {1, 4}

Now let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 4, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 6, 9)> and <6, (1, 4, 5)>.
