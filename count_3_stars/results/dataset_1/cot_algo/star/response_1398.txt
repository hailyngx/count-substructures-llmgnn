Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 8)>
