Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7 (degree 3)
- Node 1: 0, 4 (degree 2)
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7 (degree 3)
- Node 4: 1, 2 (degree 2)
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3 (degree 3)
- Node 6: 3, 9 (degree 2)
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3 (degree 3)
- Node 8: 2, 9 (degree 2)
- Node 9: 6, 8 (degree 2)

Now, we will check for the 3-stars:
- Node 0, 2, and 7 are the only nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
  - Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (<0, 1, 5, 7>)
  - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (<2, 4, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 7, 8>, <2, 5, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 5, 8>)
  - Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (<7, 0, 2, 3>)

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
Thus, the final result inside brackets is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 1, 5, 7>
- <2, 4, 5, 7>
- <2, 4, 7, 8>
- <2, 5, 7, 8>
- <7, 0, 2, 3>
