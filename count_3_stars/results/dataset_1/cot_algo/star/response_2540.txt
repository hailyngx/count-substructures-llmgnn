Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that could form a 3-star:
- Node 0: None (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: None (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: None (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: None (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: None (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: None (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: None (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: None (has only 3 neighbors)

Since none of the nodes have more than 3 neighbors, there are no 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 0, represented as [0].
