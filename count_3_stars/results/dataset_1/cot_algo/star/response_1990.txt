Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
From the provided edges, it's evident that nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 each have 3 or more neighbors. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.

For node 1:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<1, (3, 4, 7)>

For node 3:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<3, (1, 5, 7)>

For node 4:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
<4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 5:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>

For node 7:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
<7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (3, 5, 7)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have:
\[ [1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10] = [26] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (3, 5, 7)>
