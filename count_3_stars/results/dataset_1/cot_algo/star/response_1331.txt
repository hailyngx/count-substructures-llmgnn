Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 

For each node, let's find its neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5, 6}

Next, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, there are 14 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)> 

So, the final representation is: [14]
