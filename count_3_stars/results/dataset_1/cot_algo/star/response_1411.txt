Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are listed below:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>.

There are 12 unique 3-stars in total, so the final result is [12].
