Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbor {0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbor {4}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star

As all three nodes with more than 3 neighbors only form a single 3-star each, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
