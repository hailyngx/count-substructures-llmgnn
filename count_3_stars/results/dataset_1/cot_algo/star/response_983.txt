Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 5, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1+4+1+0] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 6)>
