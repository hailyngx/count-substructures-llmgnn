Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 8, Node 9

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( [1 + 1 + 4] = 6 \) 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (3, 0, 4)>
- <9, (3, 0, 8)>
