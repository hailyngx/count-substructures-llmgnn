Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 6}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

There are 16 3-stars in total, which can be listed as follows:
\[ <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, \]
\[ <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (8, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, \]
\[ <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, \]
\[ <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)> \]

So, the final answer is [16].
