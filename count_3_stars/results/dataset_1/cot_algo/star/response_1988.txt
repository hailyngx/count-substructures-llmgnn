Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 

- Node 0 has 1 neighbor: 9
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 4, 5
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 9
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 2, 3
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 9
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3, 5, and 9 can form a 3-star: <3, (5, 9)>
- Node 3, 6, and 7 can form a 3-star: <3, (6, 7)>
- Node 5, 6, and 9 can form a 3-star: <5, (6, 9)>
- Node 5, 7, and 9 can form a 3-star: <5, (7, 9)>
- Node 6, 7, and 9 can form a 3-star: <6, (7, 9)>
- Node 9, 7, and 8 can form a 3-star: <9, (7, 8)>
- Node 9, 8, and 5 can form a 3-star: <9, (8, 5)>
- Node 9, 5, and 3 can form a 3-star: <9, (5, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
