Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 2)>

In total, there are 5 3-stars, so the final answer is [5].
