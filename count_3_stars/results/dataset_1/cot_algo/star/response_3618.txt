Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 6

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: There are 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1: There are 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2: There are 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
