Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 8
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 5, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 4 neighbors: 3, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 7
Node 6 neighbors: 3, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 3, 5
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 3
Node 9 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 4 = 18 3-stars. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
