Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {4}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {8}

Now, we check each node with three or more neighbors to see if any 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  - 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
  - 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1] = 5. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, and <4, (1, 3, 6)>.
