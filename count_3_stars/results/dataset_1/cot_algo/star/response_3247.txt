Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 1, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 possible 3-stars. <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 possible 3-star. <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 possible 3-star. <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 possible 3-star. <8, (1, 6, 9)>

Combining all the unique 3-stars, we have the following:
[4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 7 3-stars
Inside brackets: [7]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>
