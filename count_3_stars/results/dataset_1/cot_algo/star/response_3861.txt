Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors, as these are the potential centers of 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 4 are the only nodes with 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total 3-stars: \( [10 + 20] = [30] \)

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 4, 5)>
- <4, (3, 4, 6)>
- <4, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 4)>
- <4, (3, 4, 8)>
- <4, (3, 4, 9)>
- <4, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
