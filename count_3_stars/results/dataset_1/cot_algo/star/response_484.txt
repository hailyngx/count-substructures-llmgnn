Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
