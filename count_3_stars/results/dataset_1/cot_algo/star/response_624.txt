Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {4, 9}
Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 9}
Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
Node 4: {0, 9}
Node 5: {2, 3, 8}
Node 7: {1, 2, 3}
Node 8: {5}
Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1: [1]
Node 2: [3]
Node 3: [6]
Node 4: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: [1]
Node 7: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 8: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: [10]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 10] = [21].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
