Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {3, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [Choose 3 out of 2 neighbors] = 0 3-stars
- Node 1: [Choose 3 out of 2 neighbors] = 0 3-stars
- Node 3: [Choose 3 out of 4 neighbors] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: [Choose 3 out of 4 neighbors] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: [Choose 3 out of 3 neighbors] = 1 3-star

Total 3-stars = 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <<3, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>>.
