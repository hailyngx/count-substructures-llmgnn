Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 7
Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5
Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5
Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5
Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5 have three or more neighbors.

Now, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing these up: 20 + 35 + 20 + 20 = 95.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [95].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
