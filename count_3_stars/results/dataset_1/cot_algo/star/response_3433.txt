Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {6, 7}

Now, let's identify 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 6)>.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 9)>.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <7, (1, 5, 9)>.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 14. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>.
