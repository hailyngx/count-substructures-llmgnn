Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3}
- Node 6: {1, 8}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, so the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 3, 4, 6>
- <4, 1, 2, 8>
- <8, 4, 6, 7>
- <8, 4, 7, 9>
- <8, 4, 8, 9>
- <8, 6, 7, 9>
