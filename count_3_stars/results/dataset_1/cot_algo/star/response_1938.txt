Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: 1 3-star <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 7: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, there is a total of [1] 3-star in the graph, which is <6, (1, 2, 4)>.
