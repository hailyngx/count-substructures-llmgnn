Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 4, 8}: <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {7, 8, 9}: <6, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
