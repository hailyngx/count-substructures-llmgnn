Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>.
