Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 7}
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with neighbors {6, 8, 7}
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with neighbors {5, 8, 1}
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with neighbors {4, 9, 7}

Total number of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (6, 8, 7)>
- <7, (5, 1, 8)>
- <8, (4, 9, 7)>
