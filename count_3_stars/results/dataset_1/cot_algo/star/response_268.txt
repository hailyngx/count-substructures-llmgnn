Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: has 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2: has 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5: has 1 neighbor, no 3-star formed.
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors, forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8: has 6 neighbors, forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 34

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<1, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (8, 9, 0)>, <6, (8, 9, 4)>, <6, (8, 9, 1)>, <6, (8, 9, 2)>, <6, (8, 9, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>
