Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are:
- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {0, 7}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {3}

Now, let's examine the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4] = [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
