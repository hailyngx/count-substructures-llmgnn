Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 0

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
