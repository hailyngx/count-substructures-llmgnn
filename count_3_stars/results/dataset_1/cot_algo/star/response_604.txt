Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0 3-stars (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1 3-star <2, (5, 6, 8)> (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0 3-stars (has 1 neighbor)
- Node 5: 1 3-star <5, (0, 1, 2)> (has 6 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1 3-star <6, (2, 7, 8)> (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (has 2 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2. 
Therefore, the final answer is [2] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (5, 6, 8)> and <5, (0, 1, 2)>.
