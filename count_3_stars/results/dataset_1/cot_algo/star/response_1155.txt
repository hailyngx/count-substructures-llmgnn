Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information about the graph, let's first create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 6}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {0, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 6}

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars in this graph. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Since it has 3 neighbors, it can form a 3-star. So, there is 1 [1] 3-star.
  <0, (2, 6, 8)>

- Node 2: Again, it has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Another 1 [1] 3-star.
  <2, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 4: This node also has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star. 1 [1] 3-star.
  <4, (5, 6, 9)>

- Node 5: It has 4 neighbors, allowing it to form a 3-star. 1 [1] 3-star.
  <5, (2, 3, 4)>

- Node 6: With 5 neighbors, it can form a 3-star. 1 [1] 3-star.
  <6, (0, 3, 4)>

- Node 9: This node also has 4 neighbors, enabling it to form a 3-star. 1 [1] 3-star.
  <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there is a total of 6 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as [6].
