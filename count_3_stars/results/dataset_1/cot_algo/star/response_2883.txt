Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5, 7}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
