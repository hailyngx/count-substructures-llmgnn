Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 3, 5, 8
Node 1: 7
Node 2: 3, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 9
Node 5: 0, 6
Node 6: 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 0, 6, 9
Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 8

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 3, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 9

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8, which we will represent as [8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
