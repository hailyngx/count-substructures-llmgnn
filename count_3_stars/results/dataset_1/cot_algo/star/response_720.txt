Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can determine the 3-stars in this graph. Let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 also forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 10 = 12, which we will put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
