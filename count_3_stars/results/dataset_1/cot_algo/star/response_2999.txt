Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: forms 3-stars with (0, 2, 5), (0, 4, 7), and (2, 5, 7)

The total number of 3-stars is [3].

Thus, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
