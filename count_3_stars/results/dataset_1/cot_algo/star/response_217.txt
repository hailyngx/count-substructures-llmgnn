Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 1: 0, 7
Node 2: 4, 9
Node 3: 0, 5, 7
Node 4: 0, 2, 5
Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 6: 0, 5
Node 7: 1, 3
Node 8: 0, 5, 9
Node 9: 2, 8

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( [10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [17] \)

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>
