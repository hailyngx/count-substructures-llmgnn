Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 2, 5, 8
Node 1: 4, 7
Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 7
Node 3: 6, 8
Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 8
Node 5: 0, 6, 7
Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 9
Node 8: 0, 3, 4
Node 9: 6, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7 have 4 or more neighbors. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 23

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the final result is: [23].
