Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {0, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [18] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
