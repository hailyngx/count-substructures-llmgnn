Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 3, 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 5, 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 6, 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 8)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final result is [4].
