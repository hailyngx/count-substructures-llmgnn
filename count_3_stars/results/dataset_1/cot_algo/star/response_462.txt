Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 7, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 8
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: Cannot form a 3-star (only 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: Cannot form a 3-star (only 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Cannot form a 3-star (only 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: Can form a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: Cannot form a 3-star (only 1 neighbor)
- Node 5: Cannot form a 3-star (only 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: Cannot form a 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: Can form a 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: Cannot form a 3-star (only 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: Can form a 3-star with neighbors 7, 8, 0

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2, which can be shown as follows:
\[ [2] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
\[ <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 0)> \]
