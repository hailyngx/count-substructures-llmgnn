Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3}
- Node 6: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {2, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2, and 3 have more than 3 neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.
- Node 7 also has more than 3 neighbors, so it can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

The 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 2, 6)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (2, 3, 6)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
