Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a few nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes.

For node 0:
Neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 9
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>

For node 1:
Neighbors: 5, 6
Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 3:
Neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 9
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>

For node 4:
Neighbors: 0, 8
Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 5:
Neighbors: 1, 7, 8
Number of 3-stars: 1
3-stars: <5, (1, 7, 8)>

For node 7:
Neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 8:
Neighbors: 4, 5, 7
Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 9:
Neighbors: 0, 3
Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13, so the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>
