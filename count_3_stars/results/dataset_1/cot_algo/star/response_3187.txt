Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1

Now, we can see that node 0, node 1, and node 2 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars in each of these cases.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3, which we will denote as [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 7, 8>
3. <2, 0, 3>
