Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6

Next, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form potential 3-stars:
- Node 0: Yes
- Node 2: Yes
- Node 7: Yes
- Node 9: Yes

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13, so [13].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
