Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the provided graph using the edge list:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 9), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 7)

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 7, 9
- Node 5: Neighbor is 6
- Node 6: Neighbors are 5, 8
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 6, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 2, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0: No 3-star can be formed (2 neighbors)
Node 1: No 3-star can be formed (2 neighbors)
Node 2: No 3-star can be formed (2 neighbors)
Node 6: No 3-star can be formed (2 neighbors)
Node 7: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed (4 neighbors)
Node 8: No 3-star can be formed (2 neighbors)
Node 9: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star can be formed (3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 = 5

List of unique 3-stars:
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (7, 9, 0)>
<8, (6, 7, 1)>
<1, (7, 0, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <2, (7, 9, 0)>, <8, (6, 7, 1)>, and <1, (7, 0, 9)>.
