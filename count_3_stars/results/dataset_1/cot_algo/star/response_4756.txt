Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, and Node 9 have 5 neighbors each. So, we apply the formula \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) for each of them.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30, which can be written as [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
