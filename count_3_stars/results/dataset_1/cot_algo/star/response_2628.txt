Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the set of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {7}
Node 1: {7, 8, 9}
Node 2: {6}
Node 3: {6}
Node 5: {7}
Node 6: {2, 3}
Node 7: {0, 1, 5}
Node 8: {1}
Node 9: {1}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>.
