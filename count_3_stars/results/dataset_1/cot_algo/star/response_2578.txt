Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Ineligible because it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 1: Ineligible because it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 2: Ineligible because it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 3: Ineligible because it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 4: One 3-star formed: <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 5: Ineligible because it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 6: Ineligible because it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 7: Ineligible because it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 8: Ineligible because it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 9: Ineligible because it has only 2 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars is 1, so the final answer is [1]. The unique 3-star found is <4, (2, 5, 6)>.
