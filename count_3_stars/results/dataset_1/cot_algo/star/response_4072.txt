Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 7

Next, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 43.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>.

So, the final result inside brackets is [43].
