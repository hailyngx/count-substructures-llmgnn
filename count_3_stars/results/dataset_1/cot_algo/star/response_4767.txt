Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 3, 5, 7

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can form a 3-star, so let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 47 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 47.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (3, 5, 7)>
