Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1 and 9
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 3, and 5
- Node 2: neighbors are 4 and 5
- Node 3: neighbors are 1 and 6
- Node 4: neighbors are 2 and 7
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 2, and 6
- Node 6: neighbors are 3, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 7: neighbor is 4
- Node 8: neighbors are 6 and 9
- Node 9: neighbors are 0, 6, and 8

Now, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 5, and Node 6 have 3 neighbors each.
  
For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \[ [1 + 1 + 4] = [6] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 3, 5>
- <5, 2, 6>
- <6, 3, 8>
- <6, 5, 9>
- <6, 8, 9>
- <6, 9, 0>
