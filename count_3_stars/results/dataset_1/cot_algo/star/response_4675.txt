Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's get the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {3, 8}
Node 2: {5, 6, 9}
Node 3: {0}
Node 5: {2}
Node 6: {2, 7}
Node 7: {6, 8}
Node 8: {0, 7, 9}
Node 9: {2, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
