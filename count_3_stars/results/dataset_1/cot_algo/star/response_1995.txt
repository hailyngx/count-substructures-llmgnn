Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 2 has neighbors: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 4 has neighbors: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 4, 5, 8
- Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 8
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9 has neighbor: 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (5, 8, 9): <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (5, 6, 8): <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (2, 4, 6): <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (2, 4, 5): <8, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4, which can be represented as [4].
