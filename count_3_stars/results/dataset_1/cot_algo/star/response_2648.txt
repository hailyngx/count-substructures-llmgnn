Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 9.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
