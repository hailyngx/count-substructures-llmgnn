Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 22
So, the total number of 3-stars is [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 6, 8>
- <1, 6, 8, 9>
- <3, 6, 8, 9>
- <6, 0, 1, 3>
- <6, 3, 7, 9>
- <8, 0, 1, 3>
- <8, 4, 9, 7>
- <8, 9, 1, 3>
- <9, 7, 3, 8>
