Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: neighbors {3, 9}
Node 1: neighbors {9}
Node 2: neighbors {3, 6}
Node 3: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
Node 4: neighbors {3, 9}
Node 5: neighbors {6, 7}
Node 6: neighbors {2, 3, 5}
Node 7: neighbors {5}
Node 8: neighbors {3, 9}
Node 9: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes can form a 3-star:

Node 3 can form a 3-star: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 9 can form a 3-star: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 = 30 \)

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30], and the unique 3-stars are <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>.
