Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {7}
Node 1: {3, 6, 7, 8}
Node 2: {3}
Node 3: {1, 2}
Node 4: {5, 9}
Node 5: {4, 6, 9}
Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 9}
Node 7: {0, 1, 6}
Node 8: {1}
Node 9: {4, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 10

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 1, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
