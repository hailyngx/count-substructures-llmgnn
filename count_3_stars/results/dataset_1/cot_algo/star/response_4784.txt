Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
   <4, (1, 6, 7)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
   <5, (0, 3, 6)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>

Node 0 has 10, Node 3 has 4, Node 4 has 1, Node 5 has 1, Node 6 has 4, and Node 7 has 10 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is 30. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>
