Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 22 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
