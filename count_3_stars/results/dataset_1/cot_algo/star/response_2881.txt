Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges in the form of an adjacency list:

0: [3, 5, 6, 9]
1: [2, 3, 5, 9]
2: [1]
3: [0, 1]
4: [8, 9]
5: [0, 1, 7]
6: [0, 8]
7: [5, 9]
8: [4, 6]
9: [0, 1, 4, 7]

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Neighbors of node 0: 3, 5, 6, 9
Neighbors of node 1: 2, 3, 5, 9
Neighbors of node 3: 0, 1
Neighbors of node 4: 8, 9
Neighbors of node 5: 0, 1, 7
Neighbors of node 6: 0, 8
Neighbors of node 7: 5, 9
Neighbors of node 8: 4, 6
Neighbors of node 9: 0, 1, 4, 7

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, and 5 each have exactly 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 3

Therefore, the final answer is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
