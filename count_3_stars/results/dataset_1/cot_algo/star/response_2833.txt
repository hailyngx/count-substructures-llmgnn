Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 6
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8
- Node 4: 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 9, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <8, (5, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
