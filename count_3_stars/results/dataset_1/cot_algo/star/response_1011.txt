Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20]. And the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
