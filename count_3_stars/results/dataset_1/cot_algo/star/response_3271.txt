Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: (5)
- Node 2: (5)
- Node 3: (8)
- Node 4: (5, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 5: (0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 6: (5, 8)
- Node 7: (4, 5)
- Node 8: (3, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 9: (4)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 = 28
So, the final count of 3-stars is [28].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
