Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, which can be represented as [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- <6, (3, 8, 5)>
