Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 30, so we have [30].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>
