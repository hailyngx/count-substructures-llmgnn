Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Thus, there are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, and <5, (2, 7, 8)>. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
