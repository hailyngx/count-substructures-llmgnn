Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ [4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4] = [60] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 60.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>
