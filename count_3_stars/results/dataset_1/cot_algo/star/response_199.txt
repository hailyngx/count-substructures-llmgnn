Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 3, 7, 9
Node 1: 4, 7, 9
Node 2: 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 9
Node 4: 1, 7
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 2, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: No 3-star
Node 4: No 3-star
Node 5: No 3-star
Node 6: No 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (4, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (3, 2, 6)>
<9, (6, 2, 0)>
<9, (6, 2, 1)>
