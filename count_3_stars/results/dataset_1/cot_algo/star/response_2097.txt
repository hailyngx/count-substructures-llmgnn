Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 2: 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 8
Node 4: 1, 3
Node 5: 0, 1, 7, 8, 9
Node 6: 7
Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6
Node 8: 3, 5
Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 0 and Node 5 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 20 = 24. 

Therefore, the final answer is [24] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 1)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>.
