Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a table to represent the neighbors of each node:

| Node | Neighbors     |
|------|---------------|
| 0    | 1, 6, 8       |
| 1    | 0, 3, 6, 7, 8|
| 2    | 3, 6, 7, 8, 9|
| 3    | 1, 2, 6, 9   |
| 4    | 6             |
| 5    | 6, 9          |
| 6    | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7|
| 7    | 1, 2, 6       |
| 8    | 0, 1, 2       |
| 9    | 2, 3, 5       |

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 = 24, which we'll put inside brackets [].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (0, 6, 8)>  
<1, (0, 6, 1)>  
<1, (6, 7, 8)>  
<1, (6, 3, 2)>  
<1, (6, 2, 3)>  
<1, (6, 3, 9)>  
<1, (7, 1, 3)>  
<1, (7, 1, 6)>  
<1, (7, 2, 3)>  
<1, (7, 2, 6)>  
<2, (3, 6, 7)>  
<2, (3, 6, 1)>  
<2, (6, 8, 0)>  
<2, (6, 8, 1)>  
<2, (6, 8, 2)>  
<2, (6, 1, 7)>  
<2, (6, 1, 3)>  
<2, (6, 1, 2)>  
<2, (6, 2, 7)>  
<2, (6, 2, 1)>  
<2, (8, 0, 1)>  
<2, (8, 0, 6)>  
<3, (1, 6, 0)>  
<3, (1, 6, 2)>
