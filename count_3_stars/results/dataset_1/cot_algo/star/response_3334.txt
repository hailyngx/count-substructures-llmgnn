Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{7}{3}] = 35 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 7)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 2, 7)>
<0, (5, 2, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (6, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
