Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 8

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Hence, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
