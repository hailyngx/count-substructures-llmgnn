Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 7}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {0, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves: (4, 5, 6)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves: (0, 2, 6)
- Node 6 forms 2 3-stars with leaves: (0, 1, 4) and (0, 3, 5)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [4], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, and <6, (0, 1, 4), (0, 3, 5)>.
