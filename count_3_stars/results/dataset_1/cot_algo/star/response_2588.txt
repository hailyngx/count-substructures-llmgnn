Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7, 9
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (1, 6, 3)>
- <0, (3, 9, 1)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>.
