Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: None (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: None (has only 4 neighbors)
- Node 3: None (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: None (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 7: None (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 8: None (has only 1 neighbor)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

So, the final answer is [30] with the unique 3-stars being <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>
