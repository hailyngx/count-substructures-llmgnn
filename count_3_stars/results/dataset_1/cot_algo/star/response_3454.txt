Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {3}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4}

Now, we can see that nodes 0 and 3 have more than 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in.

For Node 0:
- \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars

For Node 3:
- \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(20 + 20 = 40\), which can be represented as [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (6, 7, 9)>
