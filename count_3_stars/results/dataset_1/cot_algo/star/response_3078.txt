Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding all the 3-stars, we get: \[ [10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10] = [32] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
