Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [16].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>.
