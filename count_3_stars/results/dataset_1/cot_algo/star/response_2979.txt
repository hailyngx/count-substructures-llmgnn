Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {3, 4}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- From node 2, we can form 3-stars with nodes 6, 7, 9. 
- From node 3, we can form 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, 5. 
- From node 6, we can form 3-stars with nodes 7, 8, 9. 
- From node 7, we can form 3-stars with nodes 6, 8, 9. 
- From node 9, we can form 3-stars with nodes 6, 8, 2. 

So, there are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<2, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
