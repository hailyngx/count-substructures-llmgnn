Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (6, 8, 9)>
