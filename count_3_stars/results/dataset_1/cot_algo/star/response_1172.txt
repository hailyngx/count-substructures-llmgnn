Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 9)
Node 1: 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, 5, 6)
Node 2: 2 neighbors (nodes 1, 8)
Node 3: 1 neighbor (node 6)
Node 4: 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 5, 7)
Node 5: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 6, 8)
Node 6: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 5, 7)
Node 7: 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 6, 8)
Node 8: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 5, 7)
Node 9: 1 neighbor (node 0)

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, and 6: <1, (4, 5, 6)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, and 6: <5, (1, 4, 6)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, and 7: <6, (1, 5, 7)>

Finally, count the total number of 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 3
So, the final answer is [3].
