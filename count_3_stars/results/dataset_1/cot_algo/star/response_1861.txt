Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 5: neighbor {4}
- Node 6: neighbor {0}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 8}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 6, 9)> and <2, (4, 5, 8)>.
