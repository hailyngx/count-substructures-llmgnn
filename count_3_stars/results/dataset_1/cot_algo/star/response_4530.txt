Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: Does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: Does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: Does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: Does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: Does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
