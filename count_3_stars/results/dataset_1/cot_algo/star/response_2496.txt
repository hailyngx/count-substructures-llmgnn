Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 3, 6  
Node 1: 3, 9  
Node 2: 5  
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 9  
Node 4: 3, 5  
Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9  
Node 6: 0, 5, 7  
Node 7: 6  
Node 8: 5  
Node 9: 1, 3, 5  

Now, we will find the 3-stars:

For Node 0: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)  
For Node 1: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)  
For Node 2: [inom{1}{3}] = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)  
For Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
For Node 4: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)  
For Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
For Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
For Node 7: [inom{1}{3}] = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)  
For Node 8: [inom{1}{3}] = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)  
For Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars are <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>.
