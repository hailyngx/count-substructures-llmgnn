Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the provided edges:

Node 0: 2, 5, 6
Node 1: 2, 6
Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7
Node 3: 4, 8
Node 4: 2, 3, 9
Node 5: 0, 6
Node 6: 0, 1, 5
Node 7: 2, 9
Node 8: 3, 9
Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
Node 8 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
