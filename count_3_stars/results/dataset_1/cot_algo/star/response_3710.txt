Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 4, 6, 8 have 4 neighbors each.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

In total, there are 4 * 4 = 16 3-stars in the graph. 

So, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
