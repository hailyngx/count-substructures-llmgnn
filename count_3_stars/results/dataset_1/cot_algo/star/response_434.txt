Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: 5, 6, 8
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 3, 9
Node 3: 2, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 8
Node 6: 0, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 3, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6
Node 9: 2, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 3: 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 6: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 8: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the final result is [10] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, and <8, (0, 3, 5)>.
