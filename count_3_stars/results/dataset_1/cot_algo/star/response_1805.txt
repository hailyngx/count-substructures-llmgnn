Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 7
- Node 1: 3, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8: 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (2, 3, 5)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (6, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 3)>
