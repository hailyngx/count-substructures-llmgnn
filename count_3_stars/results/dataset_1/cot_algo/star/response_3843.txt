Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, the 3-star calculation can be done as follows:

Node 0: (0, 9) ⇒ Neighbors: 1
Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 8), (8, 1) ⇒ Neighbors: 3 ⇒ [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2) ⇒ Neighbors: 3 ⇒ [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 3: (3, 6), (6, 3) ⇒ Neighbors: 1
Node 4: (1, 4), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 7), (7, 4) ⇒ Neighbors: 3 ⇒ [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 5: (2, 5), (5, 2), (9, 5) ⇒ Neighbors: 2
Node 6: (2, 6), (3, 6), (6, 2), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 6), (8, 6) ⇒ Neighbors: 3 ⇒ [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 7: (4, 7), (6, 7), (7, 4) ⇒ Neighbors: 2
Node 8: (1, 8), (6, 8), (8, 1), (8, 9), (9, 8) ⇒ Neighbors: 3 ⇒ [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 9: (0, 9), (5, 9), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 5), (9, 8) ⇒ Neighbors: 3 ⇒ [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 5

Therefore, the result is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>.
