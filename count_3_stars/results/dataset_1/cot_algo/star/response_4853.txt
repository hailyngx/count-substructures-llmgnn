Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13

So, the final answer is [13] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 3, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>
