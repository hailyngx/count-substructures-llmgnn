Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 7, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
