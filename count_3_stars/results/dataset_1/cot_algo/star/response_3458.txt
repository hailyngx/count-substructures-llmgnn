Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 24 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [24]. 
The unique 3-stars are <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>.
