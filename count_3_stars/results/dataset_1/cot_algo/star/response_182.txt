Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 0
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of 20. 

So, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (9, 5, 4)>
