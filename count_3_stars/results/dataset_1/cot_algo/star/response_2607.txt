Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 7}
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 6}
Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 7}
Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 9}
Node 8: Neighbor {6}
Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7}

Now, for each node with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 3: 1 3-star
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
