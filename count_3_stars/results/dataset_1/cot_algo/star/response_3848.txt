Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars and list them out, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 4
Node 1 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 6
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 7, 8
Node 5 neighbors: 1, 6
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 7 neighbors: 1, 2, 4
Node 8 neighbors: 4, 6
Node 9 neighbors: 1, 2

Next, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if 3-stars can be formed:

Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 7, 9)>,
<1, (4, 7, 9)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center. The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 6, 9)>

In total, there are [24] 3-stars in the graph.
