Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: Neighbor is 8
- Node 2: Neighbor is 9
- Node 4: Neighbor is 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 5, 7
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 4, 6
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 1
- Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms the 3-star <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 forms the 3-star <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 7 forms the 3-star <7, (0, 4, 6)>

Since each star is counted twice (once from the central node's perspective and once from the leaf nodes' perspective), the total number of 3-stars formed is 3. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
