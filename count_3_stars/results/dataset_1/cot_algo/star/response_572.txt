Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6, 8
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 2, 9: <3, (1, 2, 9)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 2, 9: <8, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2 ([]).
