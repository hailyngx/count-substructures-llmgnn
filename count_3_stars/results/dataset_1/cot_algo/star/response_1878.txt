Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6
- Node 8: 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There is a total of \( [1 + 4] = [5] \) 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
