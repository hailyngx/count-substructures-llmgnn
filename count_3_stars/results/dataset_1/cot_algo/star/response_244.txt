Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 6 <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, 7 <1, (3, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
