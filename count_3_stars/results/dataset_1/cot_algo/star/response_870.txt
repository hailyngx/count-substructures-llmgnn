Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor {1}
- Node 8: Neighbor {5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars each node is part of:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 (Node 0 is part of one 3-star)
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 (Node 1 is part of 10 3-stars)
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 (Node 5 is part of 10 3-stars)
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 (Node 6 is part of 4 3-stars)
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 (Node 9 is part of 4 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 29
So, the total number of 3-stars is [29].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (1, 0, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (2, 0, 6)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 1, 9)>
- <5, (1, 8, 6)>
- <5, (8, 1, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (1, 0, 5)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (5, 1, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- <6, (5, 0, 9)>
- <6, (1, 8, 5)>
- <6, (8, 1, 5)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (5, 1, 6)>
