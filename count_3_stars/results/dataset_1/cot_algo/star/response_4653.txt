Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 6
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9
Node 2: 3, 4
Node 3: 1, 2, 9
Node 4: 1, 2, 6
Node 5: 8
Node 6: 0, 4, 9
Node 7: 8
Node 8: 5, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed around each node:

Node 0: Does not form any 3-star.
Node 1: Forms 1 3-star.
Node 2: Forms 1 3-star.
Node 3: Forms 1 3-star.
Node 4: Forms 1 3-star.
Node 5: Does not form any 3-star.
Node 6: Does not form any 3-star.
Node 7: Does not form any 3-star.
Node 8: Does not form any 3-star.
Node 9: Forms 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [5]

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 4, 6)>
