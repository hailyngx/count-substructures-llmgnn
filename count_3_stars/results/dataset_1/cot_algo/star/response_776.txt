Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

0: {4, 6, 9}
1: {2}
2: {1, 6, 7, 8}
3: {5, 7, 8}
4: {0, 6, 7, 8}
5: {3, 8, 9}
6: {0, 2, 4, 7}
7: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
8: {2, 3, 4, 5}
9: {0, 5, 7}

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:

0: {4, 6, 9}
1: {2}
2: {1, 6, 7, 8}
3: {5, 7, 8}
4: {0, 6, 7, 8}
5: {3, 8, 9}
6: {0, 2, 4, 7}
7: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
8: {2, 3, 4, 5}
9: {0, 5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding them up, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 29.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 0)>
<7, (9, 0, 5)>
