Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's check for 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 5, 8)>.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 5, 0)>.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 2, so the final answer is [2].
