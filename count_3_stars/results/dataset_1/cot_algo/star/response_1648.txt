Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 13 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [13].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (8, 9, 3)>.
