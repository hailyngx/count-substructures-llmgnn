Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 8}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>
