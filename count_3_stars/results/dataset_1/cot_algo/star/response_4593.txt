Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's build the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {3, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 8, 9)>.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (6, 7, 9)>.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>.

There are in total 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 20 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [20]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>.
