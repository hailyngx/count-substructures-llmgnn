Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up these values, we have a total of 2 3-stars: [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
