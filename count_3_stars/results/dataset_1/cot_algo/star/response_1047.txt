Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 2, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star formed
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star formed
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star formed
- Node 3: 0 3-stars formed
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars formed
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star formed
- Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars formed
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars formed: <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star formed
- Node 9: 0 3-stars formed

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 9, thus [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>
