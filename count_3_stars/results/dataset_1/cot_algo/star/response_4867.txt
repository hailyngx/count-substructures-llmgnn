Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 6, and 7 can form 3-stars:

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars formed: [4 + 4 + 1 = 9]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
