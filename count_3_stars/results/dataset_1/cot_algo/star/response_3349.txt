Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2}
Node 1: {6}
Node 2: {0, 7, 9}
Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 5: {3}
Node 6: {1, 3, 7, 8}
Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 9}
Node 8: {6, 9}
Node 9: {2, 3, 7, 8}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 forms four 3-stars: <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (2, 7, 8)>

So, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
