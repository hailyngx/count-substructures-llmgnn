Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5
- Node 9: 1, 6, 7

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors \( \Rightarrow \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors \( \Rightarrow \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors \( \Rightarrow \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.

The unique 3-stars are:

- <0, 1, 4>
- <3, 2, 8>
- <6, 5, 8>
- <6, 7, 9>

So, the final answer is: [6], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, 1, 4>, <3, 2, 8>, <6, 5, 8>, <6, 7, 9>.
