Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighborhood of each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 7}
Node 1: {0, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: {7, 8}
Node 3: {0, 6, 8, 9}
Node 5: {0, 9}
Node 6: {3, 8}
Node 7: {0, 1, 2}
Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 6}
Node 9: {1, 3, 5}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars from each node:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

There are no other nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so no other 3-stars can be formed.

Adding up the 3-stars from each node:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
