Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 5, 8
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 8
- Node 2 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 4
- Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 2, 6
- Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 5, 9
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4
- Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 29. Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [29].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
