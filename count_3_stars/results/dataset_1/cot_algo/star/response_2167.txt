Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 4
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 3: 7
Node 4: 0, 2
Node 5: 1, 2, 8, 9
Node 7: 2, 3, 8
Node 8: 5, 7
Node 9: 2, 5

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4] = 8 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (5, 8, 9)>
