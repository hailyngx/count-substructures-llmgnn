Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 6, 9: <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 3, 6: <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 4, 9: <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 2, 8: <9, (0, 2, 8)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars, so the final result is [4].
