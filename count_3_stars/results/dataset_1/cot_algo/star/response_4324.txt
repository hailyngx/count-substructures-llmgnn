Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6
- Node 4: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:
Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
