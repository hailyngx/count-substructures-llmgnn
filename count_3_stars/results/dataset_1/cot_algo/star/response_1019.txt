Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list based on the given edges:

1: [2, 4]
2: [1, 7, 8]
3: [5, 8, 9]
4: [1]
5: [3, 7]
6: [8]
7: [2, 5, 8]
8: [2, 3, 6, 7, 9]
9: [3, 8]

Now, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8
- Node 3: 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 (1 choose 3) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 (1 choose 3) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 (1 choose 3) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 (5 choose 3) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [13]

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
