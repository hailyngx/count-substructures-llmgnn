Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 8, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<1, (4, 6, 8)>,
<1, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<1, (3, 6, 8)>,
<3, (0, 1, 9)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 2)>,
<9, (0, 3, 7)>.
