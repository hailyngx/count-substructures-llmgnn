Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: neighbors {2}
- Node 1: neighbors {7}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {7}
- Node 5: neighbors {8}
- Node 6: neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars found: <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>
