Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
We start by listing the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 26, so the final result is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
