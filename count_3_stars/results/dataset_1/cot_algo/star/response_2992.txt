Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 2: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 1 3-star (<4, 0, 8>)
- Node 5: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 6: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 3-star (<8, 2, 4>)
- Node 9: Does not have 3 neighbors

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars are <4, 0, 8> and <8, 2, 4>.
