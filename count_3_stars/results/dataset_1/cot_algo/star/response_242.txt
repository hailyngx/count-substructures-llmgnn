Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 8}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them all up: 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 53

Therefore, there are 53 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
