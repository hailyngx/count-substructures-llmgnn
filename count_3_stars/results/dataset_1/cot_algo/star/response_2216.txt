Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's first identify the 3-star structures:

1. Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 8
   - 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>
   - Total 3-stars possible: [4]

2. Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 7
   - 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (1, 3, 7)>
   - Total 3-stars possible: [1]

3. Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 5, 7
   - 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
   - Total 3-stars possible: [1]

5. Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 4, 9
   - 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (1, 4, 9)>
   - Total 3-stars possible: [1]

8. Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 9
   - 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 5, 9)>
   - Total 3-stars possible: [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>
