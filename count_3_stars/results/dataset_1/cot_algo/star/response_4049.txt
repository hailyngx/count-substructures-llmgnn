Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form  6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
   - <1, (0, 2, 6)>
   - <1, (0, 2, 9)>
   - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
   - <1, (0, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (0, 8, 9)>
   - <1, (2, 4, 9)>
   - <1, (2, 6, 7)>
   - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (4, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (6, 7, 9)>
   - <1, (0, 2, 6)>
   - <1, (0, 2, 9)>
   - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
   - <1, (0, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (0, 8, 9)>
   - <1, (2, 4, 9)>
   - <1, (2, 6, 7)>
   - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (4, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (6, 7, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
