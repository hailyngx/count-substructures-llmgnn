Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more visual way to better understand the connections:

```
      1 --- 2 --- 5             
      |     |                   
      7     |                   
            0 --- 6             
            |     |             
            9     |             
                  4             
                  |             
                  3             
```

By examining the graph, we can identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 1
- Node 9: 0

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
For Node 1: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
For Node 2: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
For Node 3: It has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
For Node 4: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
For Node 5: It has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
For Node 6: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
For Node 7: It has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
For Node 9: It has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

There are no nodes with three or more neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed in this graph. The total number of 3-stars is thus 0, which we represent as [0].

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
