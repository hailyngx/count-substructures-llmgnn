Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information, we start by finding the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
- Node 1: [3, 5, 9]
- Node 2: [0, 6]
- Node 3: [0, 1, 6, 9]
- Node 4: [0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
- Node 5: [0, 1, 4, 6, 9]
- Node 6: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]
- Node 7: [4, 9]
- Node 8: [0, 4]
- Node 9: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Now, we look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to count the number of 3-stars.

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors => [inom{6}{3} = 20] 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors => [inom{6}{3} = 20] 3-stars
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors => [inom{6}{3} = 20] 3-stars
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors => [inom{6}{3} = 20] 3-stars

Total 3-stars: [20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 94]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [94].
