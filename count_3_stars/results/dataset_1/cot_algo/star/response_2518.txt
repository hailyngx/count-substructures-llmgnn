Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 2, 4

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 2, 4)>
