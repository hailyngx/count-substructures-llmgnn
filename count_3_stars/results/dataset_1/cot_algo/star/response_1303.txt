Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {0, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [7]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>

So, the final answer is:
[7]
