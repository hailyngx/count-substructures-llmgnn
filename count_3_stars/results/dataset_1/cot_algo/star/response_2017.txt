Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 6, 9} -> <5, (0, 6, 9)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 5, 7} -> <6, (2, 5, 7)>
Node 6 also forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 5, 8} -> <6, (2, 5, 8)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 7, 8} -> <6, (2, 7, 8)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 8} -> <9, (1, 4, 8)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 8} -> <9, (1, 5, 8)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 5} -> <9, (1, 4, 5)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 8} -> <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
