Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20] = [40]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
