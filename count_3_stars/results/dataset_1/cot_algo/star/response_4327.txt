Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 9 have 6 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-star graphs each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 20 (from Node 1) + 20 (from Node 4) + 20 (from Node 7) + 20 (from Node 9) = 80

So the total number of 3-stars is [80].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
