Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below:

- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [25] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
