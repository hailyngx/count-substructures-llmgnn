Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 7, 8}

Based on the neighbor sets, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves {4, 5, 8}: <<0, (4, 5, 8)>>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves {7, 9, 0}: <<1, (7, 9, 0)>>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves {5, 6, 7}: <<2, (5, 6, 7)>>
- Node 2 also forms a 3-star with leaves {5, 7, 3}: <<2, (5, 7, 3)>>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves {8, 6, 0}: <<4, (8, 6, 0)>>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves {1, 9, 5}: <<7, (1, 9, 5)>>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves {9, 0, 4}: <<8, (9, 0, 4)>>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [7].
