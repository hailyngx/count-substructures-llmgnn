Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6, 8}
Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4}
Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
Node 5: Neighbors {4, 7}
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8}
Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6}
Node 8: Neighbors {0, 6}
Node 9: Neighbors {3}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \[1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 16\]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>.
