Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2 and 5.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2 and 7.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 2, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 5 and 7.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 8: Neighbor is 6.
- Node 9: Neighbor is 7.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{4}{3}=4\) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{4}{3}=4\) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{4}{3}=4\) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, and <7, (1, 4, 9)>.
