Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Next, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 5, 7}. This gives us 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 7, 8}. This gives us 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 5}. This gives us 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 9}. This gives us 1 3-star.

In total, we have 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the final result is [4] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>.
