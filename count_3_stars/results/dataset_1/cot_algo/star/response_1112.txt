Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 2)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (Nodes 4, 6, 8)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (Nodes 0, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (Nodes 2, 6)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 2)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (Nodes 6, 7)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (Nodes 1, 3, 5, 8)
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (Node 5)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 6)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (Node 2)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, and <6, (1, 3, 8)>.
