Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7.

Next, we check each node to see if it forms a 3-star graph with its neighbors:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 7. <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, 5. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 7. <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, 5. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 5: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 4. <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, 9. <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars is 7, so the final answer is [7].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, and <7, (1, 3, 7)>.
