Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: 3, 4
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 0, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 8

Applying the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
