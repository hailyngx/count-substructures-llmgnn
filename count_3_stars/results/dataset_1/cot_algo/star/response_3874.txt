Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
      1
      |
      5 - 9
    / | \
  0 - 8 - 2
  |   |   |
  7   6   3
      |
      4
```

Now let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 6, 8

We can see that nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9 have 5 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 35 + 4 = 59, so the total number of 3-stars is [59].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
