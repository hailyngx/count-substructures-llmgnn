Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 6, 8

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 3: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 4: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 5: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 6: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 7: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 1 + 1] = 6 \). 
And the unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>
