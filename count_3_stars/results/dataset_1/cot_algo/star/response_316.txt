Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can analyze the 3-star graphs in this setup:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: {5, 6, 8, 9}
   - For node 0, there are 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
     The unique 3-stars involving node 0 are:
     <0, (5, 8, 9)> <0, (6, 8, 9)> <0, (5, 6, 8)> <0, (5, 6, 9)>

2. Node 1 has neighbors: {3, 6}
   - Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed with node 1.

3. Node 2 has neighbors: {5}
   - Node 2 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed with node 2.

4. Node 3 has neighbors: {1, 9}
   - Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed with node 3.

5. Node 4 has neighbors: {6}
   - Node 4 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed with node 4.

6. Node 5 has neighbors: {0, 2}
   - Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed with node 5.

7. Node 6 has neighbors: {0, 1, 4, 7}
   - For node 6, there are 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
     The unique 3-stars involving node 6 are:
     <6, (0, 1, 4)> <6, (0, 1, 7)> <6, (0, 4, 7)> <6, (1, 4, 7)>

8. Node 7 has neighbors: {6, 9}
   - Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed with node 7.

9. Node 8 has neighbors: {0}
   - Node 8 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed with node 8.

10. Node 9 has neighbors: {0, 3, 7}
   - For node 9, there are 3 neighbors, so it forms 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
     The unique 3-star involving node 9 is:
     <9, (0, 3, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we get [8].
