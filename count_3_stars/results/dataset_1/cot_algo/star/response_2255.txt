Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 8

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these up gives a total of [4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 10 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <2, (3, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (3, 5, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 6, 9)>
4. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
5. <4, (5, 7, 9)>
6. <4, (5, 8, 9)>
7. <4, (7, 8, 9)>
8. <4, (5, 6, 8)>
9. <8, (6, 4, 9)>
10. <9, (4, 8, 5)>
