Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To start, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7

Next, for each node with three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it participates in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it participates in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it participates in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it participates in 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes, we get a total of 13 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final result is [13] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (4, 7, 5)>
- <9, (4, 7, 9)>
