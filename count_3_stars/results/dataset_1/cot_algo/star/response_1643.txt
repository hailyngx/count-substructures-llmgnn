Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7}

Now, let's apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [1 + 1 + 1] = [3] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
