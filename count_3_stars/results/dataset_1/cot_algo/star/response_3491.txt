Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6

Now let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to see if we can form any 3-stars. 
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 4 + 10 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
