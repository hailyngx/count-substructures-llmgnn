Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we'll start by identifying the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7}

Now, we'll look for 3-stars in the graph based on the neighbors:

1. Node 1: Since it has 2 or more neighbors, it can potentially form a 3-star.
2. Node 3: Since it has 3 neighbors, it can form a 3-star. 
3. Node 5: Since it has 3 neighbors, it can form a 3-star. 
4. Node 7: Since it has 4 neighbors, it can form a 3-star.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Number of 3-stars formed by Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-stars formed by Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Number of 3-stars formed by Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Number of 3-stars formed by Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [1 + 1 + 4 = 6]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
