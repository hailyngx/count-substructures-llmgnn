Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbor {6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 5, 6} <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 7, 8} <6, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
