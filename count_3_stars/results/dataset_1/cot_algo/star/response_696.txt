Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 6}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 2, 3}. <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves {6, 7, 8}. <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 forms another 3-star with leaves {6, 7, 9}. <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 forms another 3-star with leaves {6, 8, 9}. <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves {1, 5, 9}. <6, (1, 5, 9)>

Final result: Total number of 3-stars = [5]
Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>
