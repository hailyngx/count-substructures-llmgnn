Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

0: [4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
1: [4, 8]
2: [3, 7]
3: [2, 8]
4: [0, 1, 9]
5: [0, 6, 7, 8]
6: [0, 5, 7]
7: [2, 5, 6, 9]
8: [0, 1, 3, 5]
9: [0, 4, 7]

Next, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph using the approach mentioned earlier:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (0, 1, 9)
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (0, 6, 7, 8)
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (2, 5, 6, 9)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars gives us:
\[ 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 13, and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
