Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we need to find the number of 3-stars and identify them. Here is the process:

1. Calculate the degree of each node by counting the number of edges incident to it:
   - Node 0: degree 5
   - Node 1: degree 1
   - Node 2: degree 4
   - Node 3: degree 2
   - Node 4: degree 6
   - Node 5: degree 3
   - Node 6: degree 6
   - Node 7: degree 4
   - Node 8: degree 1
   - Node 9: degree 4

2. For each node with a degree of 3 or more, calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:
   - Node 0, 4, 6, and 9 have a degree of 4 or more.

3. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
   - For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - For Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   - For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   - For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

4. Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 20 + 20 + 4] = [54] \)

5. Listing the unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (3, 6, 7)>
   - <4, (2, 7, 9)>
   - <4, (6, 7, 9)>
   - <4, (6, 5, 7)>
   - <6, (0, 2, 4)>
   - <6, (0, 4, 5)>
   - <6, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <6, (2, 4, 7)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, in total there are 54 3-stars in the given graph, and the unique 3-stars found are as listed above.
