Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 9
Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 8
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 3: 2, 4, 6
Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 5: 2, 8
Node 6: 1, 2, 3
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 8
Node 8: 1, 5, 7
Node 9: 0, 2, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [40]

Unique 3-stars:
