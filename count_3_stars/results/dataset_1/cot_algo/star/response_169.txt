Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 6

Now, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 17

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
