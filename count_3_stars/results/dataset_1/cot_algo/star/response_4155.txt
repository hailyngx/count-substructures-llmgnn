Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star. 
<0, (1, 6, 9)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
<1, (0, 3, 5)>

Node 3 has 5 neighbors. Therefore, it can form 10 3-stars.
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>

Node 5 has 5 neighbors. Therefore, it can form 10 3-stars.
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [1 + 1 + 10 + 10] = 22. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 9)>.
