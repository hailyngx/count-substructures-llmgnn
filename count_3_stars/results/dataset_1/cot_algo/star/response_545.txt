Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 4, 5, 9
Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 8
Node 2: 1, 4, 5
Node 3: 4, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 7: 5, 8
Node 8: 1, 7
Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 6

Now, we'll check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0 and Node 5 form a 3-star with Node 9: <0, 5, 9>
Node 1 forms a 3-star with Node 2, Node 5, and Node 6: <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 6>
Node 2 does not form a 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with Node 2, Node 3, and Node 6: <4, 2, 3>, <4, 3, 6>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with Node 1, Node 2, and Node 6: <5, 1, 2>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 2, 6>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with Node 1, Node 3, and Node 5: <6, 1, 3>, <6, 1, 5>, <6, 3, 5>
Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors.

Counting up the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of 9 3-stars: [9].
