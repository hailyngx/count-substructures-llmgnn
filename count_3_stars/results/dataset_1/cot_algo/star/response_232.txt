Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Degree: 7)
- Node 1: 8 (Degree: 1)
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8 (Degree: 3)
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5 (Degree: 4)
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7 (Degree: 3)
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6 (Degree: 3)
- Node 6: 0, 5 (Degree: 2)
- Node 7: 0, 4 (Degree: 2)
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 9 (Degree: 4)
- Node 9: 8 (Degree: 1)

Now, we look at nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 35 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 46

So, the final answer is [46], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 8, 9)>
