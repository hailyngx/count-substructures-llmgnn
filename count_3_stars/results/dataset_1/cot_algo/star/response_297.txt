Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 3), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 5), 
(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 4), (6, 5),
(6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 7),
(9, 1), (9, 6)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
Node 2 has neighbors: {4, 5, 7}
Node 4 has neighbors: {2, 5, 6, 7}
Node 5 has neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
Node 6 has neighbors: {4, 5, 8, 9}
Node 7 has neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 8}
Node 8 has neighbors: {3, 6, 7}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 can form 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>.
