Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 4, 9
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 8
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Now we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed with each:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (not considered)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (not considered)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (not considered)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 8: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 9: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>
