Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5, 6
Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 9
Node 2: 1
Node 4: 1, 8
Node 5: 0, 1
Node 6: 0
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 1

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars:
1 for node 1 (\( inom{4}{3} \) = 4)

The total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
