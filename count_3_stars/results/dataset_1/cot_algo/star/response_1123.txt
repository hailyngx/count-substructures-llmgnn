Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {0}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 5}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0 does not have 3 or more neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 = 14 [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
