Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6}
- Node 1: {8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 7}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Next, we'll check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found in the graph is <6, (0, 3, 9)>.
