Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {7, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 8}

Now, we need to find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 7 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
