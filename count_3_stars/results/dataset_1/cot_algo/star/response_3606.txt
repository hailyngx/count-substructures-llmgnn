Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 5, 6
- Node 3: Neighbors are 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: Neighbor is 6
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5

Next, we identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:
- Node 1 and Node 4 each have 4 neighbors (1, 4, 8, 9 and 0, 1, 3, 5 respectively).
- Node 3, Node 5, and Node 6 each have 4 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 9 and 2, 3, 4, 9, and 2, 3, 7, 8 respectively).

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 26. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
