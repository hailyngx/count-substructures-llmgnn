Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
