Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, therefore it forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, therefore it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, therefore it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, therefore it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <4, (6, 8, 1)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, therefore it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <8, (6, 4, 1)>, <8, (4, 1, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 23, which can be represented as [23]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 1)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (6, 4, 1)>, <8, (4, 1, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>
