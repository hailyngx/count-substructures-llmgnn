Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves (2, 4, 8), giving <0, (2, 4, 8)>.
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves (2, 4, 9), giving <0, (2, 4, 9)>.
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves (2, 8, 9), giving <0, (2, 8, 9)>.
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves (4, 8, 9), giving <0, (4, 8, 9)>.

So, there are 4 unique 3-stars formed in this graph, which gives a total of [4].
