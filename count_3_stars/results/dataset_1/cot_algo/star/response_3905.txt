Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 7 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 35 = 61

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 61.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)> 
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
