Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

\[
\begin{align*}
0 &: [1, 6, 8, 9] \\
1 &: [0, 3, 4, 9] \\
2 &: [7] \\
3 &: [1, 5] \\
4 &: [1, 8] \\
5 &: [3, 8] \\
6 &: [0, 7, 8] \\
7 &: [2, 6, 8] \\
8 &: [0, 4, 5, 6, 7] \\
9 &: [0, 1]
\end{align*}
\]

Now, let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  - <0, (1, 6, 8)>
  - <0, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <0, (1, 8, 9)>
  - <0, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
  - <1, (0, 3, 9)>
  - <1, (0, 4, 9)>
  - <1, (3, 4, 9)>

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star:
  - <6, (0, 7, 8)>

- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
  - <8, (0, 4, 5)>
  - <8, (0, 4, 6)>
  - <8, (0, 4, 7)>
  - <8, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <8, (0, 5, 7)>
  - <8, (0, 6, 7)>
  - <8, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <8, (4, 5, 7)>
  - <8, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <8, (5, 6, 7)>

In total, there are 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 19 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the final answer is [19].
