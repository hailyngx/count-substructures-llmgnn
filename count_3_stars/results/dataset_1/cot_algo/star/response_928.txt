Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3

Now, we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 7 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 35 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [47], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 6)>
<1, (6, 0, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 0)>
<1, (7, 0, 6)>
<1, (7, 6, 0)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 9, 3)>
<1, (3, 2, 9)>
<1, (3, 9, 2)>
<1, (9, 2, 3)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
