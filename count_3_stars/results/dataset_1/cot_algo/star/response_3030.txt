Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 32 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
