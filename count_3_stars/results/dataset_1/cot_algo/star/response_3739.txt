Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {6}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 8}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Now, we'll look for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 8 have 4 or more neighbors. So, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they can form.

For Node 1:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
Unique 3-stars for Node 1: 
<1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>

For Node 8:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
Unique 3-stars for Node 8: 
<8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
