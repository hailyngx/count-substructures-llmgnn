Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 2, 8, and 9.
For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 1 = 15, which we will put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
