Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7
- Node 5: 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20] = 50 \)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>

So, the final result is:
\[ [50] = 50 \]
