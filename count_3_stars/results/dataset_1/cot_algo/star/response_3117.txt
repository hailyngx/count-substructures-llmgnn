Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0 is connected to node 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 5.
- Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 3 is connected to node 5.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
- Nodes 8 and 9 are not connected to any other nodes.

We now identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>

- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 5, 6), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  Unique 3-star with node 7 as the center: <0, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1 = 11].
