Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, 9 <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, 7 <9, (4, 6, 7)>
  
The total number of 3-stars [] = 2
Unique 3-stars found: <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>
