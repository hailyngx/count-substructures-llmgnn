Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {1, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 9}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5}

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 2, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>
