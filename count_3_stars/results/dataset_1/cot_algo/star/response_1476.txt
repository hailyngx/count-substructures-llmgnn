Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 4, 7
- Node 2: Neighbor is 7
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: Neighbor is 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 4, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 5
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 6

Next, we'll check the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to see if they can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 and Node 4 can form 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 also forms 1 3-star.

Finally, we calculate the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 0) = 2. So, the final answer is [2].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
