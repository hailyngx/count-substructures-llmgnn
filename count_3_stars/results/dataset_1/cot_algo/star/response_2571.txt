Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {2, 4}
- Node 9: {3, 4}

Now, we'll apply the combinatorial calculation to nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 = 9

So, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 4)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
