Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 18. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
