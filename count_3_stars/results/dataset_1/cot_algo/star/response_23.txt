Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we'll first identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 2 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3 neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 7
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 4, 6
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 6 forms 4 3-stars: <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (3, 5, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1+1+1+4+1] = [8].
