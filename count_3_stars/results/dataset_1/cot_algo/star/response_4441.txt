Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 6, 9
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, 6: <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, 9: <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 9: <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 7: <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 7: <9, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
