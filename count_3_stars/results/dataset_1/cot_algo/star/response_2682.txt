Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 (6 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0 (1 neighbor)
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0, 3 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 6 (4 neighbors)

Next, we'll find the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 \)

Therefore, inside brackets we have [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (6, 8, 0)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
