Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 4, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 11. So, the result is [11].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
