Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {3, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (4, 9) and (3, 9). This gives 2 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 4) and (5, 9). This gives 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 9)>, <1, (3, 9)>, and <3, (1, 4)>.
