Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 5, 8
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 7

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars around them:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 4 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>.
