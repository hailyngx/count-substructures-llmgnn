Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5, 8
Node 1: 
Node 2: 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 7
Node 4: 2, 6
Node 5: 0, 7
Node 6: 4, 7, 8
Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 6
Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
Node 2: 1 3-star formed (with nodes 4, 8, 9) --> <2, (4, 8, 9)>
Node 4: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
Node 6: No 3-stars (only 3 neighbors)
Node 7: 1 3-star formed (with nodes 5, 8, 6) --> <7, (5, 8, 6)>
Node 8: No 3-stars (only 3 neighbors)
Node 9: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 8, 9)> and <7, (5, 8, 6)>.
