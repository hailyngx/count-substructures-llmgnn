Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 2, 6, 7

Now we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms <2, (7, 9, 6)>
- Node 6 forms <6, (3, 9, 4)> and <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms <7, (1, 4, 9)> and <7, (2, 4, 9)>

In total, we have 5 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [5].
