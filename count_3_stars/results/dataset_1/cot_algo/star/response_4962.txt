Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>.
