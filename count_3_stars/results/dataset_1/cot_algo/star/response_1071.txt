Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
- Node 7 also has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Lastly, we sum up the total number of 3-stars:
Total 3-stars = 10 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20] with the unique 3-stars being:
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
