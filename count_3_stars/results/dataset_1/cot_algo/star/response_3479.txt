Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 4, 6 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 6 (2 neighbors)
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9: 3, 6, 8 (3 neighbors)

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of 26 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 5)>
<0, (4, 2, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 3)>
<4, (1, 6, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 3)>
<4, (1, 5, 3)>
<6, (1, 9, 8)>
<6, (1, 9, 5)>
<6, (3, 9, 4)>
<6, (3, 8, 4)>
<6, (3, 9, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 9, 3)>
<8, (9, 0, 7)>
<8, (9, 3, 0)>
<8, (0, 9, 7)>
<8, (0, 7, 3)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 0)>
<8, (7, 6, 9)>
<8, (7, 0, 9)>

Thus, the final answer is [26].
