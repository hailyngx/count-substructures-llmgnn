Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 3}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = [16] \)

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 9, 4)>, <5, (6, 9, 5)>, <5, (7, 4, 6)>, <5, (7, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 0, 1)>, <6, (5, 0, 7)>, <6, (5, 1, 7)>
