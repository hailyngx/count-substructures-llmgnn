Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Since it has 3 neighbors, it can form a 3-star. Total 3-stars: 1
- Node 3: Since it has 3 neighbors, it can form a 3-star. Total 3-stars: 2
- Node 4: Since it has 3 neighbors, it can form a 3-star. Total 3-stars: 3
- Node 5: Since it has 4 neighbors, it can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 7
- Node 8: Since it has 4 neighbors, it can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 11
- Node 9: Since it has 5 neighbors, it can form 5C3 = 10 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 4, 5, 7)>
