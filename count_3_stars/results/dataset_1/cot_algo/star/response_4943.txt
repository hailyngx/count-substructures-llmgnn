Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 4}

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 6 have 5, 4, 3, and 4 neighbors respectively, so we can form inom{5}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{4}{3} = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19 3-stars in total.

Thus, the final calculation is [19].

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>.
