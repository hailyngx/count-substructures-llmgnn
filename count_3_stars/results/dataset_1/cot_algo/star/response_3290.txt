Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3}
- Node 6: {1, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {3, 4}

Now, we see that nodes 1, 4, and 7 have 4 or more neighbors, allowing for the formation of 3-stars. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>
