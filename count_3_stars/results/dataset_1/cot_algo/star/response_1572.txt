Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we can identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {2, 6}
- Node 1 neighbors: {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2 neighbors: {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 4 neighbors: {6, 9}
- Node 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 7 neighbors: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 8 neighbors: {9}
- Node 9 neighbors: {3, 4, 8}

Now, we can calculate the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {5, 7, 6}
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {5, 7, 9}

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
