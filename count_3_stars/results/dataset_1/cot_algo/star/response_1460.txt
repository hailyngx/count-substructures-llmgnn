Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8}

Next, we check for nodes with three or more neighbors to see if they can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 3: 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 4: 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed: <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 6: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed: <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 7: 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed: <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are: <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>.
