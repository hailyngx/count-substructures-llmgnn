Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 0, 5, 7

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Calculated 3-stars:
- \( [4 + 4 + 1] = 9 \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 7, 5)>
