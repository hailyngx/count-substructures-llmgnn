Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {0, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 4 + 10] = 19, and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
