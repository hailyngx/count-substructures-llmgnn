Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6
- Node 1: 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 2, 4
- Node 9: 1, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9

Next, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: There are less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: There are less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 9: There are less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [ 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 ] = 17

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>
