Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
<6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
<7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [14]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>
