Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 0, 3
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 0, 4

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2, with 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4, with 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 1 = 15 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 3)>
<2, (8, 3, 4)>
<2, (8, 3, 4)>
<2, (8, 4, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, 0)>
<4, (8, 9, 2)>
<4, (9, 0, 2)>
<4, (9, 2, 8)>

So the final answer is [15].
