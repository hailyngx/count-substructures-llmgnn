Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

In total, there are 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 8)>,
<4, (1, 3, 8)>,
<4, (2, 3, 8)>,
<4, (2, 4, 8)>,
<5, (0, 3, 7)>,
<5, (0, 5, 7)>,
<5, (3, 4, 7)>,
<5, (3, 5, 7)>.
