Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 8: None
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3

Next, we identify nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5. These nodes can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10, which can be represented as [10].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (5, 3, 4)>
- <0, (5, 3, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
