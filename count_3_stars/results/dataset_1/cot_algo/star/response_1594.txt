Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 29

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 4, 5, 8)>
