Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's first determine the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of them:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
