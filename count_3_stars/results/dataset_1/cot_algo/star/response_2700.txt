Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star: <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 cannot form any 3-stars as it only has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 can form 3 3-stars: <4, (5, 8, 1)>, <4, (8, 1, 7)>, <4, (8, 1, 7)>
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star: <6, (0, 9, 7)>
- Node 8 can form 3 3-stars: <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 1, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [8].
