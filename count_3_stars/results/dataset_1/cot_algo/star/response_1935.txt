Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6, 9
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:
- Node 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9 have more than 3 neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars it can form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13, so the final answer is [13].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
