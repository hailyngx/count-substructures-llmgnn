Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 6}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 3 and Node 8 have 3 neighbors each.

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- For the nodes with 4 neighbors (Node 0, Node 2, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- For the nodes with 3 neighbors (Node 3, Node 8): \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \( [5 \times 4 + 2 \times 1] = [22] \).

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 6)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
