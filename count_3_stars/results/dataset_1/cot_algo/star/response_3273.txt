Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's first find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 8}

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7 have 4 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed around those nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>

2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
   <2, (4, 5, 7)>

3. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>

4. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>,
   <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>

There are a total of 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 19 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [19].
