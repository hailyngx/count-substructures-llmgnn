Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {3, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 9}
- Node 4: {8, 9}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {2, 8}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes (6, 8, 9)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 6, 9)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>.
