Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 3, 6
- Node 2: Neighbors are 3
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 6, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 1, 4
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 5
- Node 8: Neighbors are 3
- Node 9: Neighbors are 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [8] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>.
