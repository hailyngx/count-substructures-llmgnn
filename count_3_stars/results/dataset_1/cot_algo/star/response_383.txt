Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, with 4 neighbors
- Node 2, with 4 neighbors
- Node 6, with 3 neighbors
- Node 7, with 4 neighbors
- Node 8, with 3 neighbors
- Node 9, with 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16, which we represent as [16].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
