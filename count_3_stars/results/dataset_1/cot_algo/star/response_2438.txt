Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can determine the unique 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {6}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 3, and 6 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each. (3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [3 \times 4] = [12] \]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is 12, and they are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
