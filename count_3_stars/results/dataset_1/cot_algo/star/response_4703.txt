Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 0
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4] = [5].

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>.
