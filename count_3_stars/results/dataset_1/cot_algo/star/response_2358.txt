Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph:

```
    0 -- 7 -- 1 -- 9
    |         |  / |
    8 -- 2 -- 6 -- 5
            |     
            3
```

Now, let's denote the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 2, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2, and 7 each have 5 neighbors, so they form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 0, 4, 5, 6, and 9 each have 4 neighbors, but we can't form any 3-stars with them.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed with it.
- Node 3 has only 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars can be formed with it.

So the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 10 + 10] = [30] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
