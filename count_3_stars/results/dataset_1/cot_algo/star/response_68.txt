Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}

Next, we will check the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars are formed:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 10] = [15] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (0, 6, 9)>
- <7, (3, 6, 8)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <7, (8, 9, 5)>
- <7, (8, 9, 3)>
