Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more visual way:

```
    1 -- 0 -- 4
   /         /|
  9         7 5
 /         /  /
|         6  /
|        /  /
|  3 -- 2  8
 \ |____|   |
  9    6   3
       |___/
        7
```

Based on the provided edges, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 5, and 9: <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 4 and 9: <1, (4, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 7, and 8: <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 forms two 3-stars: <7, (4, 5, 9)> and <7, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
