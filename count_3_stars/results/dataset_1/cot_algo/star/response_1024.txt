Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 9), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 3), (4, 7), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 0), (8, 3), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 5)

Now, let's find the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 6
Node 2: 3, 9
Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 4: 3, 7
Node 5: 3, 6, 9
Node 6: 1, 5
Node 7: 0, 3, 4
Node 8: 0, 3
Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Next, let's identify the 3-stars within this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14, which we will represent as [14].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<3, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<3, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<5, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 4, 8)>, 
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
