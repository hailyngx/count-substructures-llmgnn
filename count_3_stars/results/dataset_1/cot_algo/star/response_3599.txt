Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 2, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (not enough neighbors)

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 = 8

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
