Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7, 8
- Node 6: 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 3, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [28].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
