Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: No 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: No 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 3 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1] = 7. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6)>
<4, (2, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
