Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {2, 6}
Node 1: Neighbors {3, 7}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 3: Neighbors {1}
Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 9}
Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4}
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 8}
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2}
Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
Node 9: Neighbors {4, 8}

Now we can see which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23, so we write this as [23].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
