Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's find the 3-stars within this graph.

First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 7}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 5}

Now, we see that nodes 0, 6, and 7 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 1 + 4] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
1. <0, (2, 8, 9)>
2. <0, (2, 7, 8)>
3. <0, (2, 7, 9)>
4. <0, (7, 8, 9)>
5. <6, (2, 7, 8)>
6. <7, (0, 4, 6)>
7. <7, (0, 4, 1)>
8. <7, (0, 1, 6)>
9. <7, (4, 6, 8)>
