Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor of 0 is 9.
- Node 1: Neighbors of 1 are 3, 6.
- Node 2: Neighbors of 2 are 3, 4.
- Node 3: Neighbors of 3 are 1, 2, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 4: Neighbors of 4 are 2, 5.
- Node 5: Neighbors of 5 are 3, 4, 6, 7.
- Node 6: Neighbors of 6 are 1, 3, 5, 7.
- Node 7: Neighbors of 7 are 3, 5, 6, 8, 9.
- Node 8: Neighbors of 8 are 7, 9.
- Node 9: Neighbors of 9 are 0, 7, 8.

Applying the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:  
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [29] \)

Unique 3-stars found:

- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 8, 7)>
