Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's map out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1, so we have [1].

The unique 3-star found is <6, (1, 2, 3)>.
