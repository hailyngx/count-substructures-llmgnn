Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 4, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 5, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 2, 4}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: neighbor {1}
- Node 9: neighbor {1}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms one 3-star with leaves {2, 5, 6}
- Node 1 forms one 3-star with leaves {7, 8, 9}
- Node 2 forms one 3-star with leaves {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4 forms one 3-star with leaves {2, 5, 7}
- Node 5 forms one 3-star with leaves {0, 2, 4}

The total number of 3-stars is 5, so the final answer is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, and <5, (0, 2, 4)>.
