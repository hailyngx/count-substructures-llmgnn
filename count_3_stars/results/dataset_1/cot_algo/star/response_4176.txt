Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

For Node 1:
- Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 7)>

For Node 2:
- Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>

For Node 5:
- Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>

For Node 7:
- Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>

For Node 8:
- Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 29
Therefore, the final answer is [29].
