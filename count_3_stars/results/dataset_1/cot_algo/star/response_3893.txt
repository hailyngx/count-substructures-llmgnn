Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {1}
- Node 7: neighbors {9}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 6}: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 9}: <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 8, 9}: <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 8, 9}: <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 8, 9}: <1, (2, 8, 9)>

Putting all the unique 3-stars together, we have:
[5] <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>
