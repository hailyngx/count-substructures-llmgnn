Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 7}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {4, 5}
- Node 9: {3, 5}

Now, we will check for nodes that have three or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 4 and 9: <3, (4, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 5 and 8: <4, (5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 4 and 9: <5, (4, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [3].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (4, 9)>
<4, (5, 8)>
<5, (4, 9)>
