Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [18].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, and <9, (1, 5, 8)>.
