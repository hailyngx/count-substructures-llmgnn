Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes - {3}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes - {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes - {5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes - {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes - {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes - {2, 3, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes - {1, 2, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes - {3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes - {1}

Now, we can see that nodes 1, 3, and 4 have three or more neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 4] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
