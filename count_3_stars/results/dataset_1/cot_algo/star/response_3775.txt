Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by determining the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 8}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Total number of 3-stars: \(20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44\)

Therefore, the result is [44] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
