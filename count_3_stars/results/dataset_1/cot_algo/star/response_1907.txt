Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {0}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors → No 3-star
- Node 1: 2 neighbors → No 3-star
- Node 2: 1 neighbor → No 3-star
- Node 3: 1 neighbor → No 3-star
- Node 4: 3 neighbors → 1 3-star
- Node 5: 3 neighbors → 1 3-star
- Node 6: 3 neighbors → 1 3-star
- Node 7: 2 neighbors → No 3-star
- Node 8: 2 neighbors → No 3-star
- Node 9: 1 neighbor → No 3-star

So, there are a total of 3 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (0, 5, 3)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
