Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 5, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 5) + 4 (from Node 6) + 1 (from Node 8) = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (2, 1, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
