Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 7}
- Node 4: {6, 7}
- Node 5: {7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {5}

Next, we'll check for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 6, and Node 7 have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 6, and they are:
<[1, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>]
