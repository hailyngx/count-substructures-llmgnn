Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2: <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: [11]
