Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's determine the 3-stars present in the graph.

### Node 0
Neighbors: 2, 4, 8
Number of 3-stars: [1]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 8)>

### Node 1
Neighbors: 7, 8
Number of 3-stars: [1]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (7, 8)>

### Node 2
Neighbors: 0, 8
Number of 3-stars: [1]
Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 8)>

### Node 3
Neighbors: 5, 7
Number of 3-stars: [1]
Unique 3-stars: <3, (5, 7)>

### Node 5
Neighbors: 3, 9
Number of 3-stars: [1]
Unique 3-stars: <5, (3, 9)>

### Node 8
Neighbors: 0, 1, 2
Number of 3-stars: [1]
Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars: [6]
