Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Calculating the 3-stars for each node:

Node 0:
Neighbors: 1, 3, 5
There are 1 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 5)>

Node 1:
Neighbors: 0, 2, 9
There are 1 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 9)>

Node 2:
Neighbors: 1, 4, 9
There are 1 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 9)>

Node 3:
Neighbors: 0, 9
No 3-stars

Node 4:
Neighbors: 2, 6, 7
There are 1 3-star: <4, (2, 6, 7)>

Node 5:
Neighbors: 0, 6
No 3-stars

Node 6:
Neighbors: 4, 5, 7
There are 1 3-star: <6, (4, 5, 7)>

Node 7:
Neighbors: 4, 6
No 3-stars

Node 9:
Neighbors: 1, 2, 3
There are 1 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [4] and they are <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, and <4, (2, 6, 7)>.
