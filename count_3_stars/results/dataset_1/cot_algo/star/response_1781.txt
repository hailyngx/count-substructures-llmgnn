Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, the 3-stars can be identified as follows:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 5, and 6: <1, (3, 5, 6)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 4, and 7: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 9, and 6: <4, (3, 9, 6)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 5, and 9: <6, (1, 5, 9)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 4, and 6: <9, (2, 4, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
