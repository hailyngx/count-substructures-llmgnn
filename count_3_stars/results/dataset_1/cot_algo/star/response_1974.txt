Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 3, 4, 6
Node 1: 7
Node 2: 3, 5
Node 3: 0, 2, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 5, 8, 9
Node 5: 2, 4, 7
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 1, 5
Node 8: 3, 4
Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4] = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 9.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
