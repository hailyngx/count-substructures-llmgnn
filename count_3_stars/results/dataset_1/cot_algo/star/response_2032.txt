Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 8
Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7
Node 2: 6
Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 6
Node 5: 1, 3
Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 7
Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8
Node 8: 0, 7
Node 9: 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [1+4+4+4+4] = [17]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
