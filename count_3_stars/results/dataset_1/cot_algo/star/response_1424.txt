Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 7}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

In total, there are 56 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 64 3-stars in the graph, which can be represented as follows:
\[ [64] \]
Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <7, (0, 2, 1)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
