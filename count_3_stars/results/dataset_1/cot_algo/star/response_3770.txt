Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
  <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 5)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (7, 6, 5)>, <1, (4, 7, 6)>, <1, (5, 7, 6)>, <1, (4, 7, 5)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 6, 5)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it also forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 4 = 18, which can be written as [18].
