Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars in the given graph, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {5, 9}
- Node 1 neighbors: {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2 neighbors: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 3 neighbors: {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4 neighbors: {3, 5}
- Node 5 neighbors: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 6 neighbors: {1}
- Node 7 neighbors: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8 neighbors: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 9 neighbors: {0, 1}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 8, 9) - <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 7, 8) - <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 4, 7) - <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 3, 5) - <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 2, 3) - <8, (1, 2, 3)>

Since each of these 3-stars is unique, there are a total of 5 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
