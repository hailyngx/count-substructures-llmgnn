Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
