Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors => [\[inom{3}{3}] = 1]
- Node 2: 3 neighbors => [\[inom{3}{3}] = 1]
- Node 4: 5 neighbors => [\[inom{5}{3}] = 10]
- Node 5: 3 neighbors => [\[inom{3}{3}] = 1]
- Node 7: 3 neighbors => [\[inom{3}{3}] = 1]

Adding up the 3-stars from the nodes gives us a total of 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 14. 

Therefore, the final answer is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>.
