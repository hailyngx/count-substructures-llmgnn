Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1, 4, and 5 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.
- Node 0, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form 3-stars.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, so the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
