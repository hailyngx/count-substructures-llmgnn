Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {7}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, forming \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, forming \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 20, which we will put inside brackets as [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>.
