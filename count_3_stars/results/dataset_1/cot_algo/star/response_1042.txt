Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 4, 7
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 7: 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 7

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>.
