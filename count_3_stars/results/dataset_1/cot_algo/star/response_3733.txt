Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: neighbors are 2, 6, 8
- Node 2: neighbors are 1, 5
- Node 3: neighbors are 4, 6
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 3, 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: neighbor is 0
- Node 8: neighbors are 1, 5
- Node 9: neighbors are 4, 5, 6

Now, let's find 3-stars:
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
