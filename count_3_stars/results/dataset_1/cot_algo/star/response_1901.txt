Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {2, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: does not form a 3-star
- Node 3: forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: does not form a 3-star
- Node 5: forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: does not form a 3-star
- Node 7: does not form a 3-star
- Node 8: forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: does not form a 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
