Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 3
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4 neighbors: 1
- Node 5 neighbors: 3, 6
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 3, 6
- Node 8 neighbors: 3, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 4, 6) <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 5, 7) <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 2, 5) <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 7, 8) <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 9, 1) <8, (3, 9, 1)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (3, 9, 1)>.
