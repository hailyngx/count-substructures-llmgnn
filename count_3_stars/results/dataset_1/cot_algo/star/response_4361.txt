Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 2, 3}
- Node 7: neighbor {1}
- Node 8: neighbor {4}
- Node 9: neighbor {1}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors {0, 2, 3}, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 3)>.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is then [1], and the unique 3-star found is <6, (0, 2, 3)>.
