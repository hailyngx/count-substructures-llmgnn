Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 6, 8: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 6, 8: <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 6, 9: <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 8, 9: <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, 9: <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 5, 9: <8, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
