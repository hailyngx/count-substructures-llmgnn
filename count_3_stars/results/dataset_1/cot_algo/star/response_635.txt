Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4
- Node 7: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 2 has 7 neighbors, so it can form 7 choose 3 = 35 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <7, (2, 5, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 (from node 0) + 35 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) = 39, i.e., [39].

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>.
