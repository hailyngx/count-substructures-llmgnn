Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 8} -> <3, (2, 4, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <3, (2, 4, 8)>.
