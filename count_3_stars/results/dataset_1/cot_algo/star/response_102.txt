Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-star graph within this graph, we first need to find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 1, 7

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 7

Therefore, the final result is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>
