Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Next, we identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

For nodes with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
