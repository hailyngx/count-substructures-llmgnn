Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2}

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 5, and Node 8 each have 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star each.
- Node 1, Node 4, and Node 6 each have 3 neighbors, forming \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

So, inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars is [7].
And the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4, 6)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6, 7)>
