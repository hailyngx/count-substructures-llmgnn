Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3
- Node 5: 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 0, 6, 9
- Node 9: 5, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each:
- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 6: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the final result is [11] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>.
