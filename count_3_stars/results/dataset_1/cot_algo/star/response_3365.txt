Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 9
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 9
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
