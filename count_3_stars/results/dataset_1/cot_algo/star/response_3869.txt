Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 1, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 1: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 6: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
  
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 [16]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
