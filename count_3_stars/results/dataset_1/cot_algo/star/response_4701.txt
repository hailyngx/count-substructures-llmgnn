Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by listing the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors (forming 10 3-stars)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (forming 4 3-stars)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (forming 1 3-star)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (forming 4 3-stars)
- Node 6: 7 neighbors (forming 35 3-stars)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (forming 4 3-stars)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us [58].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 4)>
- <3, (7, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
- <8, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
