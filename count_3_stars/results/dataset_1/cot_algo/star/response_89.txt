Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {2, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

From the neighbor sets, we see that nodes 2, 4, and 5 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with these nodes.

For node 2:
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (7, 6, 9)>

For node 4:
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 5:
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7, and they are: 
[7]
<2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>.
