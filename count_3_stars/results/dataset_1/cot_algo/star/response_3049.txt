Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are a total of 10 3-stars in this graph, and they can be represented as:
\[ [10] \]
\[ <0, (1, 3, 9)> \]
\[ <3, (0, 2, 4)> \]
\[ <4, (3, 5, 8)> \]
\[ <9, (0, 3, 8)> \]
