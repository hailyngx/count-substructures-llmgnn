Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 8}

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 and Node 5 have exactly 3 neighbors each, allowing them to form 1 3-star each.
- Node 2 and Node 8 have 6 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.

Now we sum up the total number of 3-stars:
Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 20 = 42

Therefore, there are 42 3-stars in the given graph.
