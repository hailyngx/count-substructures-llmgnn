Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 4, and 8 have 3 neighbors each.
 
Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars since it has only 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found is: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
