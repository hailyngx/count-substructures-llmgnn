Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 0 and Node 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate \(\binom{6}{3}\) for each of them. 
- For Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For Node 6: \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 35 = 36.

Therefore, the final answer is [36] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 8, 9)> and <6, (1, 3, 4)>.
