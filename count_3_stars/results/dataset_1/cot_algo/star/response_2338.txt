Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 8

Next, we'll check which nodes have three or more neighbors to see if they can form any 3-stars:
- Node 4, Node 8, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each node with three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of unique 3-stars they can form:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 1 = 12, which we'll denote as [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>
