Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, we can see that nodes 2, 4, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6, which we'll represent as [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
