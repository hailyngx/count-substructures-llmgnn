Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars based on the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 9, 5)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 3)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <7, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <9, (2, 3, 5)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 28.
