Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 3, 4, 6

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding them up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 28

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
