Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3}

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1:  \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2:  \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3:  \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9:  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
10 (from node 1) + 10 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 9) = 34

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>
