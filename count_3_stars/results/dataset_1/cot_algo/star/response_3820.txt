Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {7}
- Node 1: neighbors {3}
- Node 2: neighbors {9}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of \(1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 21\) 3-stars in this graph.  

So, the final answer is [21] and the unique 3-stars are <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.
