Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 3, 6

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (the same 3-star as Node 2)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 1] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>
