Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node having 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1] = [26] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
