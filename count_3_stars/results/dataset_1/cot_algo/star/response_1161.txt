Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 6
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 3
- Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 5
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 3
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 3, 6
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7 has neighbors: 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 3
- Node 9 has neighbors: 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 6)>.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 0)>.

Putting these together, we have a total of [1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 10 3-stars:

<0, (1, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 9, 0)>
