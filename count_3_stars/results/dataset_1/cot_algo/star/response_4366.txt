Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 8

Unique 3-stars:
<0,1,8>
<1,0,9>
<4,6,9>
<6,2,4>
<9,4,5>
<9,4,8>
<9,5,8>
<9,5,1>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
