Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbor nodes {6}
Node 1: Neighbor nodes {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 2: Neighbor nodes {4, 7, 8, 9}
Node 3: Neighbor nodes {4, 6, 8}
Node 4: Neighbor nodes {1, 2, 3, 8}
Node 5: Neighbor nodes {1}
Node 6: Neighbor nodes {0, 1, 3}
Node 7: Neighbor nodes {2}
Node 8: Neighbor nodes {1, 2, 3, 4}
Node 9: Neighbor nodes {1, 2}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 23 3-stars in the graph:

[23]
Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
