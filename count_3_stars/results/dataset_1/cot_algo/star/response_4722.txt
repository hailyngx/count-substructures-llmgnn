Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <8, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>.
