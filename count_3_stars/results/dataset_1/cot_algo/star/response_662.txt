Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9}
2. Node 1: Neighbors = {7}
3. Node 2: Neighbors = {5}
4. Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 4}
5. Node 4: Neighbors = {3, 6}
6. Node 5: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9}
7. Node 6: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7, 9}
8. Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8}
9. Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 7}
10. Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>
