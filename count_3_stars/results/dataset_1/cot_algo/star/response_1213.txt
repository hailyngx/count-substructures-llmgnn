Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 5: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 6: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: Does not have 3 or more neighbors

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 = 5, which we will represent as [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 9, 6)>
- <8, (9, 6, 5)>
