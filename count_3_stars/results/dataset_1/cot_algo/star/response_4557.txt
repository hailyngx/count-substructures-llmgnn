Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 5}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars: 
  <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
