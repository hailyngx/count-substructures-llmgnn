Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0

Next, calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

There are a total of 10 + 4 = 14 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>.
