Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list based on the given edges for easier visualization:

0: [2, 4, 6, 7]
1: [2, 6, 8]
2: [0, 1, 4, 8, 9]
3: [4, 5, 6, 8]
4: [0, 2, 3, 8]
5: [3]
6: [0, 1, 3, 9]
7: [0, 8]
8: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
9: [2, 6]

Now let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {2, 4, 6, 7}. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {2, 6, 8}. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}. It forms 10 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {4, 5, 6, 8}. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 8}. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 9}. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}. It forms 10 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: {2, 6}. It does not form any 3-star.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [24].

Therefore, the 3-stars are: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>.
