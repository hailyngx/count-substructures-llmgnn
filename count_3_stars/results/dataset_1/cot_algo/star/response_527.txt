Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 1: 2, 5, 6
Node 2: 1, 7, 9
Node 3: 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 4: 6, 7, 8
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 1, 3, 4
Node 7: 2, 3, 4
Node 8: 3, 4
Node 9: 2, 3

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

Node 1: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 2: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 3: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 6: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 7: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 9: 2 neighbors (less than 3, so no 3-star)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
