Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 4, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 19

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>
