Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, let's first list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 6

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 4, 5: <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, 8: <5, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
