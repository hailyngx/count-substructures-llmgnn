Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 1: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>.
