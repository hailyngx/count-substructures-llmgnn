Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 3, and 5 have 3 neighbors, so each can form a 3-star.
- Node 2 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- With 3 neighbors: 3 3-stars
- With 5 neighbors: 10 3-stars
- Total: 3 + 10 = 13 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
