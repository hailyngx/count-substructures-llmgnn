Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9 have 4 neighbors each.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 8, 9): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each node.

Since all nodes with three or more neighbors have 4 3-stars each, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \). 

Therefore, the final result is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
