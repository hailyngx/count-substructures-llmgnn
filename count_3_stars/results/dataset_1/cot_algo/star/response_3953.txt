Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 8
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Nodes 1, 5, and 9.

For Node 1: 
It forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

<1, (5, 6, 9)>

For Node 5: 
It forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

<5, (0, 1, 8)>

For Node 9: 
It forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
