Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 4: neighbors {7}
- Node 6: neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {1}
- Node 9: neighbors {6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2, which we'll represent as [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
