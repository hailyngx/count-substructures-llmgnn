Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph using the approach described earlier.

Let's first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {2, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 20 + 4 = 25, which we will put inside brackets as [25].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>.
