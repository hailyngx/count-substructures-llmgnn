Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 6
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding all of these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
