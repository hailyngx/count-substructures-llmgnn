Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 2
- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 2, 3
- Node 9 neighbors: 3, 4

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with (2, 5, 6)
Node 2 forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 5)
Node 3 forms a 3-star with (7, 8, 9)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, and <3, (7, 8, 9)>.
