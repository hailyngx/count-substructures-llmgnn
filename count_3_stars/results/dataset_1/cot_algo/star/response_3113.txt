Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

There are some nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9. We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, there are 17 3-stars in this graph:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 6, 7)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>
