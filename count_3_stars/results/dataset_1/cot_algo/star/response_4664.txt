Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 18, which we will represent as [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>
