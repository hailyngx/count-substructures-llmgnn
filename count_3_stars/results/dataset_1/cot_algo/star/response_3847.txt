Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented in the following way:

```
0 --- 5
|     |
|     |
9 --- 1 --- 7 --- 2 --- 8
      |     |     |
      |     |     |
      6 --- 3 --- 9
            |
            |
            6
```

For this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 9, 2
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 9, 6
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9

For each of these nodes:
- Node 1 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 3 can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 5 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 41

Therefore, the final answer is [41] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 6)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
