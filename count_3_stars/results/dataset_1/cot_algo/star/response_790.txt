Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {0, 3}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the total number of 3-stars:

- Nodes 1, 2, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.
    - Node 1 and Node 9 form 10 possible 3-stars each.
    - Node 2 forms 10 possible 3-stars.
    - Total 3-stars formed: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>
