Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Next, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: none
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1, 8, 9
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: none
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: none

Now, we will count the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \sum \binom{n}{3} \]

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} \]

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 4 + 10 + 20 = 34 \]

So, there are a total of 34 3-stars in the given graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
