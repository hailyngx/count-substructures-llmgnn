Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 1, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 28. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
