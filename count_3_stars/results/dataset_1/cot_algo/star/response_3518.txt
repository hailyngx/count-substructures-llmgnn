Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {4, 5}
Node 1: {4}
Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 3: {4}
Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
Node 5: {0, 2, 9}
Node 6: {2, 4, 7, 8}
Node 7: {2, 6}
Node 8: {4, 6}
Node 9: {2, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 20 + 4 = 34 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [34] and the unique 3-stars found are: <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>.
