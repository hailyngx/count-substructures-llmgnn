Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 5

Now, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding them up: \( 4 + 10 + 10 = 24 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 24. 

Therefore, the result is [24] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
