Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (0, 1, 3). This forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 3)>.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (2, 4, 6). This forms 1 3-star: <9, (2, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <8, (0, 1, 3)> and <9, (2, 4, 6)>.
