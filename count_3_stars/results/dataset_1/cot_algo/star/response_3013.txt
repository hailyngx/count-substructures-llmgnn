Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2: 0, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Can form a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: Can form a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 9: Can form a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, 4, 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 30. 

Therefore, the final result is [30], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 9)>.
