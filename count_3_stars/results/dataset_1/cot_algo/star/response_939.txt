Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 3, 7, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 9}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
Node 4 neighbors: {8, 9}
Node 5 neighbors: {2, 3, 9}
Node 6 neighbors: {2, 9}
Node 7 neighbors: {0, 2, 8}
Node 8 neighbors: {3, 4, 7}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
   <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>

- Node 1: also has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center. 
   <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>

- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center. 
   <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, 
   <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>

- Node 3: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center. 
   <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, 
   <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>

- Node 9: also has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center. 
   <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, 
   <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Summing up all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 38 3-stars in this 3-star graph.
