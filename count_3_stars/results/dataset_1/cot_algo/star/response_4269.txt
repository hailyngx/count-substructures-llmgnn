Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7

Now letâ€™s identify nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3 stars: <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 3, 3 stars: <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 4, 3 stars: <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 6, 3 stars: <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 7, 3 stars: <7, (1, 5, 8)> 

Total number of 3-stars: [6]
