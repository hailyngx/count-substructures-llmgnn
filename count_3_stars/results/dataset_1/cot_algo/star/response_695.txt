Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 8}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 56

Therefore, the answer is [56] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (4, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (5, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (5, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>
