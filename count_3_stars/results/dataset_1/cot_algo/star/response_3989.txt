Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

Node 0: 1, 6, 8  
Node 1: 0, 6, 7  
Node 3: 4, 8  
Node 4: 3, 8  
Node 6: 0, 1  
Node 7: 1, 8  
Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 7  

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed using the given information:

For node 0:  
- Node 1, 6, and 8 are its neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 0.  

For node 1:  
- Node 0, 6, and 7 are its neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 1.  

For node 8:  
- Node 0, 3, 4, and 7 are its neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, so we put this inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>.
