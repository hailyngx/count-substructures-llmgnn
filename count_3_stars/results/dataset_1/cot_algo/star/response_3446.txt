Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 8
Node 1: 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 2: 9
Node 3: 5, 8
Node 4: 1, 6, 8
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 1, 4, 8
Node 7: 1, 8
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
Node 9: 2

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of those nodes:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 6 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 8 has 6 neighbors -> \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 26. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<4, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>
