Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and determine the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
