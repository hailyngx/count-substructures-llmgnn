Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: 5, 8, 9
    - Number of 3-stars formed: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
    - Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 8, 9)>

2. Node 1 has neighbors: 6, 9
    - Number of 3-stars formed: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

3. Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 6, 9
    - Number of 3-stars formed: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
    - Unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 6, 9)>

4. Node 3 has neighbors: 6, 8, 9
    - Number of 3-stars formed: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
    - Unique 3-stars: <3, (6, 8, 9)>

5. Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 8, 9
    - Number of 3-stars formed: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, (2, 8, 9)>

6. Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9
    - Number of 3-stars formed: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
    - Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 8, 9)>

7. Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 9
    - Number of 3-stars formed: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
    - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 9)>

8. Node 7 has neighbors: 5, 8, 9
    - Number of 3-stars formed: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
    - Unique 3-stars: <7, (5, 8, 9)>

9. Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
    - Number of 3-stars formed: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
    - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 5, 9)>

10. Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
    - Number of 3-stars formed: 9 (since it has more than 3 neighbors)
    - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Summing up all the 3-stars found, the final count is [11].
