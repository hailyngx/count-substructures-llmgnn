Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1, 7, and 6 form a 3-star: <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 3, 4, and 8 form a 3-star: <3, (4, 8, 7)>
- Node 4, 5, and 7 form a 3-star: <4, (5, 7, 3)>
- Node 6, 1, and 7 form a 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 9)>

There are a total of [3] unique 3-stars in the graph.
