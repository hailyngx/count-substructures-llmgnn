Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 1, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 6

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9 each contribute \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( [6 \times 1] = 6 \).

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
