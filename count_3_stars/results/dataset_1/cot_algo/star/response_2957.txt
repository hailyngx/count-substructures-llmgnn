Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 8, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 7, 8
- Node 6: Neighbor is 0
- Node 7: Neighbors are 4, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 3

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if a 3-star can be formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, which are: 
  - <0, (2, 3, 6)>
  - <0, (2, 3, 8)>
  - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <0, (3, 6, 8)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, which are: 
  - <1, (2, 4, 8)>
  - <1, (2, 8, 9)>
  - <1, (4, 8, 9)>
  - <1, (2, 4, 9)>

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: 
  - <3, (0, 8, 9)>

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: 
  - <4, (1, 8, 7)>

- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, some of which are:
  - <8, (0, 1, 3)>
  - <8, (0, 1, 4)>
  - <8, (1, 3, 4)>
  - <8, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <8, (0, 3, 4)>
  - <8, (3, 4, 7)>
  - <8, (0, 1, 7)>
  - <8, (1, 3, 7)>
  - <8, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <8, (0, 4, 7)>

Adding all the possible 3-stars found, the final count is [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10] = 20.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 7)> among others.
