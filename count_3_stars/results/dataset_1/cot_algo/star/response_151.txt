Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 3, 9}: <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 7}: <8, (1, 2, 7)> and another 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 9}: <8, (1, 2, 9)>

Since nodes 5 and 8 have more than 3 neighbors each, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of them:
- For node 5, there is only one unique 3-star <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- For node 8, there are two unique 3-stars <8, (1, 2, 7)> and <8, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, and <8, (1, 2, 9)>.
