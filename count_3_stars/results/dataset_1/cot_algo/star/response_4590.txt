Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 31, which should be enclosed in brackets: [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>
