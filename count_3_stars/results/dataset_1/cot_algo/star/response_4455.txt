Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

From the neighbor list:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with neighbors: (3, 4, 5), (3, 5, 6), (4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 9)
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with neighbors: (2, 6, 8), (2, 6, 5), (2, 5, 7), (6, 7, 8)

The total number of 3-stars is 8, so the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 5, 7)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
