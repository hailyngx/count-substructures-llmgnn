Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 8
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars by looking at nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 5, 6: <1, (0, 5, 6)>
Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 8, 9: <1, (0, 8, 9)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 6, 7: <8, (0, 6, 7)>

There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [3].
