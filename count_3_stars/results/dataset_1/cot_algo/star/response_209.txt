Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors and forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors and forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors and forms 1 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors and forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
    - <8, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <8, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <8, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <8, (1, 3, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7
So, the final answer is [7].
