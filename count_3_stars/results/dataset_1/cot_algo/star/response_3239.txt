Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {5}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.

Now we need to calculate the number of 3-stars. For nodes with 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars is given by \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
