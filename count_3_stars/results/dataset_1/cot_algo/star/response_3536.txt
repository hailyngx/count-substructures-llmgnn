Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7, 9. This gives <3, (5, 7, 9)>.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 8, 9), so there are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-star configurations with node 6 as the center:
  - <6, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <6, (2, 5, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (5, 8, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
