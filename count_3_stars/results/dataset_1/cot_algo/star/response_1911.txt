Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 8

Now we find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
    <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
    <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
    <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 = 6].
