Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8
Therefore, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
