Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The adjacency list representation of the graph is as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5
- Node 5: 1, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 3 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 9)>.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of 8 3-stars in this graph, which can be listed as:
<[0, (3, 1, 4)>, <0, (3, 2, 7)>, <1, (3, 0, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>].
So, the final result is [8].
