Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 1: 5, 7, 8
Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 3: 2
Node 4: 6, 8
Node 5: 1, 2, 8
Node 6: 2, 4
Node 7: 1, 2, 8
Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 9: 8

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

Node 1: 3 neighbors (5, 7, 8)
Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8)
Node 7: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8)
Node 8: 5 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 7, 9)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
