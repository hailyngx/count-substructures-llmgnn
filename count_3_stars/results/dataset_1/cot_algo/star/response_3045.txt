Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [4 + 10 + 10 + 20] = [44] \]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 5)>, <5, (6, 8, 5)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 5)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 8, 0)>
