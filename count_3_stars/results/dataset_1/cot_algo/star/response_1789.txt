Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5
- Node 9: 2, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can participate in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can participate in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can participate in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can participate in 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13 \), so we list the unique 3-stars found:

\[ <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)> \]
