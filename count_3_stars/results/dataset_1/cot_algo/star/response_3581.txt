Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in adjacency list format:

0: [2, 3, 4, 5]
1: [3, 7]
2: [0, 6]
3: [0, 1]
4: [0, 8]
5: [0]
6: [2]
7: [1]
8: [4]

Now, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {4}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor (less than 3), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor (less than 3), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor (less than 3), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor (less than 3), so no 3-star is formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
