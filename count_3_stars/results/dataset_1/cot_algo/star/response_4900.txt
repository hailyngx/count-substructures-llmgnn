Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6

Now, let's examine the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
