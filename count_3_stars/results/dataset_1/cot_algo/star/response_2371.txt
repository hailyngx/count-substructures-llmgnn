Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {3}
Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 3: {0, 5, 7}
Node 4: {1, 2, 9}
Node 5: {2, 3, 7}
Node 6: {2}
Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
Node 8: {7}
Node 9: {1, 2, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars: [10 + 10 + 1 = 21]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
