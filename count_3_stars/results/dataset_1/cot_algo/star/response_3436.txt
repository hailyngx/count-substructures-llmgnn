Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:
- Node 0: neighbors are 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: neighbors are 3, 6
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: neighbor is 1
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 5
- Node 5: neighbors are 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 5, 7
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: neighbors are 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: neighbor is 2

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: None

For nodes with 3 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10, so we put [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
