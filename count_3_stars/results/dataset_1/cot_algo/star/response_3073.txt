Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 6, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1
- Node 3: Neighbors are 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 3, 5
- Node 7: Neighbors are 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 3, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>.
