Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors - 2, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors - 7, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors - 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: Neighbors - 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors - 5, 6
- Node 5: Neighbors - 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors - 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: Neighbors - 1, 3
- Node 8: Neighbors - 0, 5
- Node 9: Neighbors - 1, 3, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars:
- Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 3 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
