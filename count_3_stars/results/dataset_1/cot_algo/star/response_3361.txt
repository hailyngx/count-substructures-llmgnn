Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 7. <1, (6, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 8. <3, (6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 7, 8. <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars: one with leaves 0, 1, 9 and another with leaves 3, 5, 9. <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
