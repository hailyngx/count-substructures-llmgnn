Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: (2, 3, 4, 8)
- Node 1: (6, 7, 8)
- Node 2: (0, 3, 4)
- Node 3: (0, 2, 7)
- Node 4: (0, 2, 5)
- Node 5: (4, 6)
- Node 6: (1, 5)
- Node 7: (1, 3, 9)
- Node 8: (0, 1, 9)
- Node 9: (7, 8)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars with Node 0.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with Node 1.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with Node 2.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with Node 3.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with Node 4.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with Node 7.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with Node 8.

Summing up the possibilities, we get a total of [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [10] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (8, 9, 1)>
- <8, (9, 7, 1)>
