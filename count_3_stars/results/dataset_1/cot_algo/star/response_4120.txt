Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: (3, 5)
- Node 1: (2, 4, 6)
- Node 2: (1, 6)
- Node 3: (0, 5, 7)
- Node 4: (1, 7, 8)
- Node 5: (0, 3, 9)
- Node 6: (1, 2, 7)
- Node 7: (3, 4, 6)
- Node 8: (4, 9)
- Node 9: (5, 8)

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 6 \]

Therefore, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets, we get: [6]

Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>
