Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's denote the nodes mentioned in the edges: 
Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and  8.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 8.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this 3-star graph:

Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 9: <1, (3, 5, 9)>.
Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8: <2, (4, 6, 8)>.
Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 8: <3, (5, 6, 8)>.

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have 3 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [3].
