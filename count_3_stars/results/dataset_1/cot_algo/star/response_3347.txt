Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {2, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {3, 7}

Now, let's identify which nodes can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: Cannot form a 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 1: Cannot form a 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 2: <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (7, 4, 9)>
- Node 4: Cannot form a 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 5: Cannot form a 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 6: Cannot form a 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 7: <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 8: Cannot form a 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 9: Cannot form a 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (5, 6, 7)> and <7, (2, 3, 9)>.
