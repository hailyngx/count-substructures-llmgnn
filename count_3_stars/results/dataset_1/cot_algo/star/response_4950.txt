Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us 4 + 1 = 5. So, the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <2, (0, 3, 7)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 7, 8)>
4. <2, (3, 7, 8)>
5. <4, (5, 7, 9)>
