Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8}

Nodes 4, 6, 9 have 4 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 = 18

So, the final answer is [18] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
