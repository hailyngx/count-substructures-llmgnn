Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 3, which we'll represent inside brackets [].
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 7, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, and <7, (0, 4, 2)>.
