Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {2, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6}

Next, let's identify the 3-star graphs:
- Node 1, 2, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, forming 3-stars.
  - Node 1: <1, (3, 7, 9)>
  - Node 2: <2, (4, 6, 7)>
  - Node 6: <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>

Finally, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Total = [1 + 1 + 2] = [4]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>
