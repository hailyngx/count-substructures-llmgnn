Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 9
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the final result is [15] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>
