Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 1] = [9].

The unique 3-stars found are: <<2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>>.
