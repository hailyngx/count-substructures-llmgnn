Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5
- Node 8: 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1] = 6.
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>.
