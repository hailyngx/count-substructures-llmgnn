Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The 3-star graph can be analyzed as follows:

Node 0 has neighbors {1, 4, 9}.
Node 1 has neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.
Node 2 has neighbors {4, 7}.
Node 3 has neighbors {6, 7, 9}.
Node 4 has neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}.
Node 5 has neighbors {1, 4, 6, 8}.
Node 6 has neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5}.
Node 7 has neighbors {1, 2, 3, 8}.
Node 8 has neighbors {1, 5, 7}.
Node 9 has neighbors {0, 3}.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1 forms 20 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 20 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20 + 20 = 40]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
