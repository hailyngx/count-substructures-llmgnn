Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and determine the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <0, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 1: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 3: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <3, (1, 4, 6)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <6, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 4, 7)>

Summing up the total number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of \([10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = 40\) unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [40].
