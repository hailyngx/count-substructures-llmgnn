Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following structure:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 2 is only connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 8.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 8 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 also has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [56 + 20] = 76 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
1. <0, (1, 4, 7)>
2. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
3. <0, (1, 7, 8)>
