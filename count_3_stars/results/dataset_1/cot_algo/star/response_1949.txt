Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 7, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each such node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42 \), which we'll denote as [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>
<9, (8, 0, 2)>
