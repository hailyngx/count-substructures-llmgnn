Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (3, 4, 8)>
