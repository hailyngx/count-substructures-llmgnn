Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {4, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 8}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 8: {3, 4}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
