Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <1, 7, 8, 9>
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <2, 6, 7, 8>
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <7, 1, 2, 8>
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <8, 1, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, 7, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 7, 8>, <7, 1, 2, 8>, and <8, 1, 2, 7>.
