Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {7}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star <1, (0, 6, 9)>.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star <4, (5, 7, 9)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
