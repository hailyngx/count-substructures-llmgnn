Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: No 3-stars as it has only 3 neighbors
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>.
