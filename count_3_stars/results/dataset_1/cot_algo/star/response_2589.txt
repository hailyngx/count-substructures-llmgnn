Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 6
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 2 neighbors

Now, we can see that only node 1 and node 8 have exactly 3 neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [0] and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are <> (since there are no 3-stars formed).
