Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [18] \]

There are 18 unique 3-stars in this graph, which are:
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (8, 9, 2)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (4, 5, 8)>
- <8, (5, 4, 8)>
- <9, (0, 7, 2)>
- <9, (1, 7, 2)>
