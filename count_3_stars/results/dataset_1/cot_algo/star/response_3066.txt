Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 44

So, the final answer is [44] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
