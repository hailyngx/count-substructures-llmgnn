Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [25] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <4, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (4, 5, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 7)>
