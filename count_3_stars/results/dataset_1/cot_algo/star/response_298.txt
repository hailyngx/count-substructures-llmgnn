Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 9
Node 1 neighbors: 7
Node 2 neighbors: 6, 7, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 7
Node 6 neighbors: 2
Node 7 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 7
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 2, 7

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 = 11, which we will represent as [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>.
