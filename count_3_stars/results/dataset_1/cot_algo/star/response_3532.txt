Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 and Node 1 both have 4 neighbors, so each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 also has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 7) = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
