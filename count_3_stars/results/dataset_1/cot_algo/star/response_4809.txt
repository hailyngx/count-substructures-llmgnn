Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 6, 7}
Node 1: {4, 9}
Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 3: {0, 9}
Node 4: {1, 7}
Node 5: {2}
Node 6: {0, 2}
Node 7: {0, 2, 4}
Node 9: {1, 2, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 2: 1 3-star
Node 3: 0 3-stars
Node 4: 0 3-stars
Node 5: 0 3-stars
Node 6: 1 3-star
Node 7: 1 3-star
Node 9: 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, 2)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
