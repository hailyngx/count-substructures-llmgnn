Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 7

Nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13
So, the final result is [13] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>.
