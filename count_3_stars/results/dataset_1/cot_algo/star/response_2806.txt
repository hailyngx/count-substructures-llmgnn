Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each node is a part of:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 1 = 15, and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>

These 15 unique 3-stars are enclosed in <> brackets.
