Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Since there are 10 nodes in the graph, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5}

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-star configurations:

- Nodes 2, 4, 5 have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 2 can form 3-stars using its neighbors {0, 5, 8}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 3-stars using its neighbors {1, 7, 9}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 3-stars using its neighbors {2, 6, 9}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] is 3, and the unique 3-stars found <> are:
<2, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>
