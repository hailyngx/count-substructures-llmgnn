Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 9 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the answer is [9] with the unique 3-stars found being <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>
