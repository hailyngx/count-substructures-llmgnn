Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0, 6 inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 3, inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4, inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6, inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8, inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 45

So, the final answer is [45] and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
