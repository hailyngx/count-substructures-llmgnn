Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: Neighbor is 5
- Node 3: Neighbor is 5
- Node 4: Neighbor is 5
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 6: Neighbor is 7
- Node 7: Neighbors are 6, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 7
- Node 9: Neighbor is 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, with 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5, with 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7, with 2 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 = 5, which gives us [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
