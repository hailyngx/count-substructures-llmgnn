Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can determine the 3-stars in this 10-node graph.

First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are 5 3-stars in total, and we can list them as follows:
[5]
<0, 3, 8>
<4, 0, 6>
<6, 4, 5>
<8, 1, 9>
<6, 0, 7>
