Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
We will start by listing the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 5, 8

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 2: <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (5, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
