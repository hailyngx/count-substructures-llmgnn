Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 7
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 7
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
  <0, (1, 2, 7)>

- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
  <1, (0, 7, 8)>

- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
  <6, (8, 9, 7)>

- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
  <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>

- Node 8: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

- Node 9: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

The total number of 3-stars is 1+1+1+10 = 13, which we represent as [13].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (8, 9, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>
