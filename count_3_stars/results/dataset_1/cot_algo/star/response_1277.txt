Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are as described. 

Let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {2, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 9: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)> 
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
