Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 7}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {0, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4] = 6 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
