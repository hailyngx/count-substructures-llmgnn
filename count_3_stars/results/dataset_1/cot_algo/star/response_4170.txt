Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 1: Possible 3-stars = 1 (it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Possible 3-stars = 1 (it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: Possible 3-stars = 4 (it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 7: Possible 3-stars = 10 (it has 5 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 6) + 10 (from node 7) = 16

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
