Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 3 and 5
- Node 1: Neighbor is 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 5, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0 and 5
- Node 4: Neighbors are 6, 7, and 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3, and 6
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 4, and 5
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2 and 4
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2 and 4
- Node 9: Neighbor is 1

Now, we can see which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors

Now, we apply the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 3-stars, represented as:

\[ [10] \]

<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
