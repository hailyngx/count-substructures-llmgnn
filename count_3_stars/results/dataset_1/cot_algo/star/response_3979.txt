Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbor sets are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {3, 5, 9}: <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {0, 4, 7}: <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {0, 3, 7}: <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {2, 5, 6}: <7, (2, 5, 6)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, therefore the total number of 3-stars is [4].
