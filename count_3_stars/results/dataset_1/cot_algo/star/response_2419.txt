Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 7
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 6, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: [3]
