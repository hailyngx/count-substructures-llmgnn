Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6

Now, we will look for 3-stars in the graph by considering nodes with three or more neighbors:

For Node 1: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is [4] in this graph.
