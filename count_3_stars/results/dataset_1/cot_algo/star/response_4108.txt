Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 23 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (5, 6, 7)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
- <9, (3, 8, 9)>
- <9, (6, 8, 9)>
