Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 1, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, leading to the formation of <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, and <0, (4, 6, 8)>.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 7)>.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <3, (5, 9, 1)>.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (5, 8, 0)>.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, forming <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, and <5, (3, 4, 6)>.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <8, (4, 9, 0)>.

Adding up all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 12 unique 3-stars. Thus, the number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [12].
