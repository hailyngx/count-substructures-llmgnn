Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, the graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 connects to nodes 3 and 4
- Node 1 connects to nodes 2, 4, and 7
- Node 2 connects to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 3 connects to nodes 0, 5, and 9
- Node 4 connects to nodes 0 and 1
- Node 5 connects to nodes 3 and 8
- Node 6 connects to nodes 2 and 9
- Node 7 connects to nodes 1 and 2
- Node 8 connects to nodes 2 and 5
- Node 9 connects to nodes 3 and 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8. <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 9. <3, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2, and we represent them as [2] in brackets.
