Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Only 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Only 1 neighbor)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 3: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Only 1 neighbor)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Only 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Only 1 neighbor)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Only 2 neighbors)

There are a total of 3-stars:
\[ [1] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, 0, 4>
