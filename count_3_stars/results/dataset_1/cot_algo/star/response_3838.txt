Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5, 6, 9
Node 1: 7
Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 3: 2, 4, 7
Node 4: 3, 8
Node 5: 0, 2
Node 6: 0, 7
Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 6
Node 8: 2, 4, 9
Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 11

So, the total number of 3-stars is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
