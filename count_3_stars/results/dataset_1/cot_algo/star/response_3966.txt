Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14
Therefore, the final answer is [14].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
