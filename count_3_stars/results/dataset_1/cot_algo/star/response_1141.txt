Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 6
Node 1: 0, 4
Node 2: 0, 6
Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 9
Node 5: 3, 8
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 7: 6
Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 9: 4, 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
Node 3: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
Node 4: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
Node 6: [\( \binom{6}{3} \)] = 20
Node 8: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 33

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
