Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 7
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 1, 5

Next, we check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  
Finally, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 10

Therefore, the final result is:
[10]
