Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 6, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 10] = [16]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
