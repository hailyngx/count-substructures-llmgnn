Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 5: 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7

For the nodes with 3 or more neighbors (nodes 0, 5, 6, and 8), we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: Since it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars formed = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
Therefore, the final answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
