Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5}

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9 each have at least 3 neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [10] \)

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (8, 1, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>
