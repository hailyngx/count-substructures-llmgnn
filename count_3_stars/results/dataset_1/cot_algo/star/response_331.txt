Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can now analyze the 3-stars in this graph.

Let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 4}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [0]
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [0]

Total number of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<(2, 3, 4), (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
