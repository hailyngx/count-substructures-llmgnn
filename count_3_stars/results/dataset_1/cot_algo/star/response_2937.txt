Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 1] = 5 \).

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>.
