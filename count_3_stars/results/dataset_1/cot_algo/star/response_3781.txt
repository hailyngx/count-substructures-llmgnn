Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 10 = 18]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (7, 6, 8)>
<8, (7, 8, 9)>
