Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 3

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>.
