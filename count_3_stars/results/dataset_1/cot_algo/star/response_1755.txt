Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighboring nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: Neighbors are 2, 4
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: Neighbor is 8
- Node 6: Neighbor is 2
- Node 7: Neighbor is 2
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 5
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star <2, (1, 3, 6)> and forms 1 3-star <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star <4, (0, 3, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, and <2, (1, 3, 7)>.
