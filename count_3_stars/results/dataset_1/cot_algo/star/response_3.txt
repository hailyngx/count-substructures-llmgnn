Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7 (degree = 4)
- Node 1: 4, 7 (degree = 2)
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7 (degree = 3)
- Node 3: 9 (degree = 1)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9 (degree = 5)
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7 (degree = 3)
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7 (degree = 3)
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6 (degree = 5)
- Node 9: 3, 4 (degree = 2)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
