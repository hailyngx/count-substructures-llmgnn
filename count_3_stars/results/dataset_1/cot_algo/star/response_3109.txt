Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 8

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, 6. Thus, there is 1 3-star with Node 3 as the center.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 9. Thus, there is 1 3-star with Node 4 as the center.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, 8. Thus, there is 1 3-star with Node 6 as the center.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, 8. Thus, there is 1 3-star with Node 9 as the center.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
