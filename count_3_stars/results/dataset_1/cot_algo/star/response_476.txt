Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 4

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is [22], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
