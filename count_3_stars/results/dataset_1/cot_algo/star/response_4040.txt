Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
