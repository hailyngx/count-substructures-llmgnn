Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 7

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 5, 9)>
2. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>
3. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>
4. Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.

Therefore, there are 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 3-stars in total, which can be represented as [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>.
