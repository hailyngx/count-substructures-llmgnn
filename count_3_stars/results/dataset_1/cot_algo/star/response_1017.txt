Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. Then we will check which nodes can form 3-stars and count the total number of 3-stars.

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Now, we will check which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star

In total, there are 4 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [4] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
