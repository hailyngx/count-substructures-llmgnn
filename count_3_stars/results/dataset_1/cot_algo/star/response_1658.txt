Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 --- 3
|    /|\   
|   / | \
|  /  |  \
4 --- 9   5
|     \  /
|      \/
|      /\
2     6  7
 \  
  \
   8 
   |
   1
```

Let's first find all the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {4}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Since nodes 0, 3, and 4 have three or more neighbors, we can form 1 + 4 + 10 = 15 3-stars in total.

So, the final answer is [15] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
