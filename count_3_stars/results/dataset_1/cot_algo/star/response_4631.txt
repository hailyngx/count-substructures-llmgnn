Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, we need to determine how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with 4 as the center.
- Node 6 also has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with 6 as the center.
- No other node has 3 or more neighbors, so no additional 3-stars can be formed.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
