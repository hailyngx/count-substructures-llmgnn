Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 9}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes: <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes: <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
