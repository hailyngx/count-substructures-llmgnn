Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node. Then we will identify the 3-stars formed in the graph.

Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
Node 1: {2, 5}
Node 2: {0, 1, 6}
Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 9}
Node 4: {0, 8}
Node 5: {1, 3, 6}
Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
Node 7: {0, 6}
Node 8: {4, 6}
Node 9: {0, 3}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
