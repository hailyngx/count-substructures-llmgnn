Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's see which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 8

Since they have 3 or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of possible 3-stars for each:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
