Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 18.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (7, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 6)>
