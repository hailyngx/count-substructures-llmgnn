Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: Neighbor set size = 3. No 3-stars.
- Node 1: Neighbor set size = 2. No 3-stars.
- Node 2: Neighbor set size = 1. No 3-stars.
- Node 3: Neighbor set size = 2. No 3-stars.
- **Node 4:** Neighbor set size = 4. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 5:** Neighbor set size = 5. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: Neighbor set size = 3. No 3-stars.
- Node 7: Neighbor set size = 2. No 3-stars.
- Node 8: Neighbor set size = 2. No 3-stars.
- Node 9: Neighbor set size = 4. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: \( [0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4] = [19] \)

Unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>
