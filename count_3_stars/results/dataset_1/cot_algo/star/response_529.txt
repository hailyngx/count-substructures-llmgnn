Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list to visualize the graph:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7
Node 2: 0, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 9
Node 5: 0
Node 6: 8
Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 9
Node 8: 6, 9
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, which leads to \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars, however, it is not possible to form a 3-star with node 0 as the central node since it has more than 3 neighbors.

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, which can form a 3-star. Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 1 as the central node: <1, (0, 3, 4)>.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors, which is exactly enough to form a 3-star. Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 2 as the central node: <2, (0, 7, 9)>.

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, which leads to \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, however, it is not possible to form a 3-star with node 3 as the central node since it has more than 3 neighbors.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors, which leads to \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, however, it is not possible to form a 3-star with node 4 as the central node since it has more than 3 neighbors.

Node 7 has 4 neighbors, which can form a 3-star. Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 7 as the central node: <7, (1, 2, 9)>.

Node 9 has 6 neighbors, which leads to \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars, however, it is not possible to form a 3-star with node 9 as the central node since it has more than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of the 3-stars found, which is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, and <7, (1, 2, 9)>.

Thus, the final answer is [3].
