Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 9
- Node 5: 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 13 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- <7, (5, 6, 1)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 1)>
