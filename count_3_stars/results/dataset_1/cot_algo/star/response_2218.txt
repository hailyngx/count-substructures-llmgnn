Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list all the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 = 6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (4, 3, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
