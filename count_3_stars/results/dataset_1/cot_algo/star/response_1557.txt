Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll first determine the neighbor set for each node and then check for nodes with three or more neighbors to count the 3-stars.

Node 0 neighbors: 2
Node 1 neighbors: 5, 6
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 3
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 3, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 1
Node 6 neighbors: 1
Node 7 neighbors: 8
Node 8 neighbors: 3, 7
Node 9 neighbors: 3, 4

Now, let's check the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
<3, (2, 4, 8)> 
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
