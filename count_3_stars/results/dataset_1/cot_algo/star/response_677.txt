Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list the unique 3-stars, we first need to find the neighbors of each node. Then, we'll identify the 3-stars.

### Neighbors of Each Node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {1, 8}
- Node 5: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 6}

### 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors and will not form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors and will not form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor and will not form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors and will not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors and will not form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors and will not form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1] = 2.
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 6, 9)> and <8, (1, 4, 5)>.
