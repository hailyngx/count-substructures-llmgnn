Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5
Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 3: 1, 6
Node 4: 1, 6, 7
Node 5: 0, 1, 8
Node 6: 3, 4, 8
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 1, 5, 6
Node 9: 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1: In this case, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>

Node 5: In this case, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 8)>

Adding the total number of 3-stars, we get a final count of [11].
