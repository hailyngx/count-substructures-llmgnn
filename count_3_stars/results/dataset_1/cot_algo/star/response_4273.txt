Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 9
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 1: 1 3-star, <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 7: Inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is 9, so the final answer is [9].
