Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 4}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star   (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star   (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  (10 unique 3-stars)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star   (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star   (1 unique 3-star)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 14 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
  
Thus, the final result is [14], with unique 3-stars listed inside <> brackets.
