Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 4}
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 9, 7}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 6}

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>.
