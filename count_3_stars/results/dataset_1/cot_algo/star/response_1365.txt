Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {4, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {2, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node:

- Node 0: Since it has only 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1: Since it has only 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8: Since it has only 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 7) = 9. 

So, the final result is [9] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 2, 9)>, <5, (2, 9, 5)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, and <7, (3, 5, 6)>.
