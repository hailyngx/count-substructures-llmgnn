Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 3

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 6 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 2 and Node 4 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2 (from nodes 0 and 6) + 4 (from nodes 2 and 4) = 6.
In bracket notation, this is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
