Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Now we can sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 (from node 2) + 0 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 8) = 5

So, there are 5 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 7, 8)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
