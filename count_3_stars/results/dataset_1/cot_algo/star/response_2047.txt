Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 7
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0, Node 4, and Node 9 have 3 neighbors each, so they each form a 3-star:
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <9, (0, 4, 0)>

There are 3 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [3].
