Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the neighbors of each node. Then, we will determine the number of 3-stars each node can form and calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

### Neighbors of Each Node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7

### Nodes with 3 or more Neighbors:
- Node 3, Node 4, and Node 5 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form.

### Calculation of 3-Stars:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

### Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total = 1 + 1 + 20 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22], and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
