Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 7 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 10 = 73

So, the total number of 3-stars is [73].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<(3, 5, 6), 8>
<(3, 6, 8), 9>
<(4, 5, 8), 9>
<(5, 6, 8), 9>
<(6, 7, 8), 9>
