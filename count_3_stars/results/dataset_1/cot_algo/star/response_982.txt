Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 0: Since it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

For Node 1: Since it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

For Node 2: It has 3 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
<2, (3, 6, 7)>

For Node 4: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
<4, (0, 7, 5)>

For Node 6: It has 3 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
<6, (1, 2, 9)>

For Node 8: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

For Node 9: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Adding up all the 3-stars formed: 1 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 6) + 1 (from Node 9) = 4

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
