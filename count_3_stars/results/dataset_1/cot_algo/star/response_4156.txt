Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 0, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors. Nodes 0, 2, and 6 have 4 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 2: inom(3, 3) = 1
- Node 6: inom(3, 3) = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1] = [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
