Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 4
Node 2 neighbors: 3, 6, 7
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 6
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1
Node 5 neighbors: 7, 8
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3
Node 7 neighbors: 2, 5
Node 8 neighbors: 5, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 8

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 8

Calculating the 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (5, 9, 0)>
