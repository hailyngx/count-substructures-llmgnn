Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 4 = 18, so the final answer is [18].
