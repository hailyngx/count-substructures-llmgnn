Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8: <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <4, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
