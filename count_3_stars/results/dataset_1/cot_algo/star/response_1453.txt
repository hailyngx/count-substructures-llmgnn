Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {0, 2}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(inom{2}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \(inom{2}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \(inom{1}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \(inom{1}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \(inom{2}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \(inom{1}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 7: \(inom{1}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \(inom{1}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \(inom{2}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0] = [4] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4. The unique 3-stars are:
1. <6, (0, 1, 7)>
2. <6, (0, 1, 8)>
3. <6, (0, 7, 8)>
4. <6, (1, 7, 8)>
