Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The 3-star graph can be visualized as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: 
- It has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with node 0 as the center. 
<0, (4, 7, 8)>

For node 2: 
- It has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with node 2 as the center.
<2, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 3: 
- It has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with node 3 as the center.
<3, (4, 6, 7)>

Combining all the 3-stars, we have a total of 3 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
