Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Next, we check for each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 1 = 6]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 1, 5)>
- <0, (4, 1, 8)>
- <4, (6, 9, 0)>
- <8, (3, 9, 0)>
