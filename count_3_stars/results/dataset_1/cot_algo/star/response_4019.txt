Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
Node 2: {1, 3}
Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
Node 4: {0, 9}
Node 5: {3}
Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
Node 7: {6, 8}
Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
Node 9: {0, 1, 4}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
