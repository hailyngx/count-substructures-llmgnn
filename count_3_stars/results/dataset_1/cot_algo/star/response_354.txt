Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 6
- Node 9: 2, 6

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars possible for each node with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [11]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
