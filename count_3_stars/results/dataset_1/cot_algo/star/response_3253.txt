Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {3, 4, 6}
Node 1: {5, 8, 9}
Node 2: {4, 9}
Node 3: {0, 7, 8}
Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 9}
Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 7}
Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 7: {3, 5, 6}
Node 8: {1, 3, 6}
Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 6}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 and Node 6 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 10 3-stars each.
Node 1 and Node 4 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 3-stars each.

Summing up all the 3-stars:
\[ [10 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [28] \]

There are 28 total 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
