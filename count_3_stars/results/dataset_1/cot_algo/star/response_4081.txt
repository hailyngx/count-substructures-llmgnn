Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 1, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 4, 5, 7

Next, we will identify nodes that have at least three neighbors since only those can form a 3-star.
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6 (possible 3-star)
- Node 4: 1, 7, 9 (possible 3-star)
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7, 9 (possible 3-star)
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8 (possible 3-star)
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 9 (possible 3-star)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8, which we will denote as [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
