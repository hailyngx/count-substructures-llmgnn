Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 4, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 24

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>.
