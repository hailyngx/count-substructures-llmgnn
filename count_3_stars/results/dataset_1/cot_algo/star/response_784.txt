Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 7
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6
So, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>
