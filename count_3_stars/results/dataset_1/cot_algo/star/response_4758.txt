Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 6: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, 7: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, 9: <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 6: <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, 9: <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 4: <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, 9: <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 7: <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, 6: <9, (0, 4, 6)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 9 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [9].
