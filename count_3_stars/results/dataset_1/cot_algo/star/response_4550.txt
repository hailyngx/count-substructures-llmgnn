Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <4, (3, 5, 6)>
2. <5, (0, 4, 8)>
3. <5, (4, 8, 9)>
4. <5, (0, 8, 9)>
5. <5, (0, 4, 9)>
6. <8, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
