Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 4, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: neighbor {4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Calculate for each node that has three or more neighbors: inom{n}{3}
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (7, 5, 8)>, <3, (7, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
