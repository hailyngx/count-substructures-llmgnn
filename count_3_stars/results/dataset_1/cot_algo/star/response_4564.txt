Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 1, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 6)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 8)>
Node 3 does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star.
Node 4 does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star.
Node 5 forms two 3-stars: <5, (2, 4, 6)> and <5, (0, 6, 9)>
Node 6 does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star.
Node 9 does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [3]
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>
