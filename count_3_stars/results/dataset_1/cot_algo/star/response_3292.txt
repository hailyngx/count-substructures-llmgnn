Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 66\)

So, the final answer is [66] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
