Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor set = {1}
- Node 1: Neighbor set = {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbor set = {7}
- Node 4: Neighbor set = {1, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbor set = {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor set = {2, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbor set = {5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbor set = {1, 4, 5}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4, 5, and 9 have 2, 3, and 3 neighbors respectively, so they cannot form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4
List of unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
