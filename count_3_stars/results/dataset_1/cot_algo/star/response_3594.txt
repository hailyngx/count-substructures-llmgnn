Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 2, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
Node 3: 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 4: 6
Node 5: 1, 2, 3
Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 1, 3
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to potentially form a 3-star:

Potential 3-star nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each potential node:
- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 1: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33], and the unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>
