Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have more than three neighbors.

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1 can form 3-stars with {2, 4, 7} and there are `C(3,3) = 1` ways.
- Node 2 can form 3-stars with {1, 3, 5} and {1, 7, 9}. There are `C(5,3) = 10` ways in total.
- Node 3 can form 3-stars with {2, 5, 9}. There's only `C(3,3) = 1` way.
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with {1, 5, 6}. There's only `C(3,3) = 1` way.
- Node 5 can form a 3-star with {2, 3, 4}. There's only `C(3,3) = 1` way.
- Node 6 can form 3-stars with {4, 7, 9} and {3, 7, 9}. There are `C(4,3) = 4` ways in total.
- Node 7 can form 3-stars with {1, 6, 9} and {2, 6, 9}. There are `C(4,3) = 4` ways in total.
- Node 9 can form 3-stars with {2, 6, 7}, {3, 6, 7}, and {0, 6, 7}. There are `C(5,3) = 10` ways in total.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
