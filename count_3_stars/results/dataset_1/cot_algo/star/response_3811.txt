Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {0, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars and the number of ways they can be formed:

- Node 0: 1 3-star [0, (1, 2, 3)]
- Node 3: 1 3-star [3, (0, 6, 7)]
- Node 7: 1 3-star [7, (0, 4, 9)]

Summing up, we have a total of [3] 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>
