Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 3, 5  
Node 2: 6, 8  
Node 3: 0  
Node 4: 9  
Node 5: 0  
Node 6: 2  
Node 8: 2, 9  
Node 9: 4, 8  

Next, we will find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

Total number of 3-stars: 0  
So, the final answer is [0].
