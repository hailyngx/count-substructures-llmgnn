Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
    1 -- 8
   /     |
  4 -- 0
 /|    /|
8 |   2 |
 \| /  /
  7 --3
 /|  /
6 | / 
 \|/
  5
```

We first calculate the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 6)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (4, 8)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 7)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (0, 2, 7)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 7, 8)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (0, 5)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 7)

Now, we can identify the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 
  <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>

- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>

- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <3, (0, 2, 7)>

- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 1)>

- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <5, (2, 6, 7)>

- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
  <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10] = 24. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 5)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 7)>, 
<2, (0, 5, 7)>, 
<2, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 7)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 7)>, 
<4, (0, 7, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<4, (7, 8, 1)>, 
<5, (2, 6, 7)>, 
<7, (2, 3, 4)>, 
<7, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<7, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<7, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<7, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<7, (2, 5, 8)>, 
<7, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<7, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<7, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
