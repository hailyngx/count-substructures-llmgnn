Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbor nodes for each node:

0: 4, 5, 6
1: 2, 6, 7, 9
2: 1, 4, 6
3: 4
4: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
5: 0, 7, 8
6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
7: 1, 4, 5, 6
8: 4, 5, 6
9: 1, 4, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors
- Node 6 has 7 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed from each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{7}{3} = 35
- Node 6: inom{7}{3} = 35
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 35 + 35 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 82

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
