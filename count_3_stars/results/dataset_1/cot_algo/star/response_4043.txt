Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10
So, the final result is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <0, (3, 4, 9)>
3. <0, (3, 6, 9)>
4. <0, (4, 6, 9)>
5. <3, (0, 4, 6)>
6. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
7. <6, (0, 3, 4)>
8. <6, (0, 3, 8)>
9. <6, (0, 4, 8)>
10. <6, (3, 4, 8)>
