Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 8: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)

Therefore, we have a total of 2 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as:

\[ [2] \]

Unique 3-stars:
- <8, 1, 9>
- <9, 3, 5>
