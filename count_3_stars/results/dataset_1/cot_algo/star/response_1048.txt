Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 5
Node 1: 7
Node 2: 3, 7, 8
Node 3: 2, 5
Node 4: 0
Node 5: 0, 3
Node 6: 9
Node 7: 1, 2
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Therefore, there is 1 3-star in this graph. 

The unique 3-star found is: <2, (3, 7, 8)>

So, the final answer is [1].
