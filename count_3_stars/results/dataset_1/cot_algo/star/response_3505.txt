Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 6}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 9) = 18

So, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 2, 8>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <5, 8, 9>
