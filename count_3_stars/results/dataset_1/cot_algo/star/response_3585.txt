Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 5: neighbor {8}
- Node 6: neighbor {3}
- Node 7: neighbor {0}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 = 5]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
