Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbor {7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbor {7}
- Node 6: Neighbor {8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed by each:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>

These unique 3-stars are listed inside <> each only once.
