Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 forms \({{7}\choose{3}} = 35\) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 4, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 35 + 1] = [39].
