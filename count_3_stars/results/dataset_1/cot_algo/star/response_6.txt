Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 7}
- Node 4: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

There are a total of 40 possible 3-stars in this graph. 

So, the final result is: [40]
And the unique 3-stars are: 
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
