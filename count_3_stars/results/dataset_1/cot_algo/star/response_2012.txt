Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors for forming 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38

So, the final answer is [38] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>.
