Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:
```
   0 --- 3 --- 2       5 --- 9
   |     |             |
   |     |             |
   6 --- 7 --- 4       8
```

Now, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4
- Node 9: 5

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the final result is [11] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>
