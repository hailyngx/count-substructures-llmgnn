Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 36 3-stars in this graph: [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <8, (0, 2, 6)>
