Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- <6, (5, 8, 1)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
