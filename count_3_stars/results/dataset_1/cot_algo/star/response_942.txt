Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with its edges:

```
    0---8---5
    |       |
    |       |
    8---6---7
    |   |  
    0   7
``` 

Next, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-stars can be formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-stars can be formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: 1 3-star can be formed: <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: 10 3-stars can be formed: <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 4)>, <8, (6, 7, 6)>, <8, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (6, 4, 7)>, <8, (6, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
