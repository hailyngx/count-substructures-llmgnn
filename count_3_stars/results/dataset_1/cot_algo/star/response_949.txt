Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbor {5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5}

Now we will identify the number of 3-stars formed at each node:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 14 3-stars for this graph: [14]

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (3, 2, 7)>
