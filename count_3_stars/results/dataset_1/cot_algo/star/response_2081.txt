Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 5: <0, (1, 8, 5)>
- Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9: <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 7: <4, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
