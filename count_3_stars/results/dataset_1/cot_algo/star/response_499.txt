Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7.

Now let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 5)>.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
  <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
  <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)> , <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, 
  <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 2, 7)>.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
  <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>,
  <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 3, 7)>.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars:
  <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, 
  <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 5)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, 
  <5, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (5, 6, 7)>, 
  <5, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (5, 7, 8)>.
- Nodes 6, 7, and 8 all have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 45, which we can represent as [45]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 2, 7)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 5)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<5, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<5, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (5, 7, 8)>.
