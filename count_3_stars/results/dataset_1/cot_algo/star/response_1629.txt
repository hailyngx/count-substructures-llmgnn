Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node: 

0: 1, 4, 6  
1: 0, 6, 8  
2: 7, 8  
3: 8  
4: 0, 7  
5: 6  
6: 0, 1, 5  
7: 2, 4, 8, 9  
8: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9  
9: 7, 8  

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms one 3-star <0, (1, 4, 6)>  
Node 1 forms one 3-star <1, (0, 6, 8)>  
Node 4 forms one 3-star <4, (0, 7, 9)>  
Node 6 forms one 3-star <6, (0, 1, 5)>  
Node 7 forms one 3-star <7, (2, 4, 8)> and one 3-star <7, (8, 9, 4)>  
Node 8 forms one 3-star <8, (1, 2, 3)> and one 3-star <8, (7, 9, 2)>  

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [7].
