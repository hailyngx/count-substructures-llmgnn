Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 1, 4

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 possible 3-stars)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors, 1 3-star)
- Node 6: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 = 5.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, and <5, (0, 4, 3)>.

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get: [5].
