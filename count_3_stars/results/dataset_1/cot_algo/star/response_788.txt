Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the neighbor sets for each node in the graph are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5}

Now, we will look at each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed with it:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with it as the center. 
  The 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>.
  
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star with it as the center: <4, (0, 7, 9)>.

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star with it as the center: <5, (3, 8, 9)>.

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with it as the center.
  The 3-stars are <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>.

- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star with it as the center: <9, (0, 4, 5)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [17].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows: 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>.
