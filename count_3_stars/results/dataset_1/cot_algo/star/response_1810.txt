Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 5

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 3, 5, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [10] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
