Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars can be calculated by first determining the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9}
Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 5, 9}
Node 3: Neighbors = {8, 9}
Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7}
Node 6: Neighbors = {7, 8}
Node 7: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 8: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7}
Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 10

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (7, 1, 0)>
<9, (7, 5, 1)>
<9, (3, 7, 1)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
