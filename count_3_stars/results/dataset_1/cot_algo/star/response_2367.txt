Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 1, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: Since node 4 has exactly 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
