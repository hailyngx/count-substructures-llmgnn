Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars:
  <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, 
  <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 20 = 22, so the final answer is [22].
