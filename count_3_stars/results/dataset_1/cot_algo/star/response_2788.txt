Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
We first need to determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 4}

Based on the neighbor sets, we can identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
  - <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>

- Node 1: 1 3-star
  - <1, 0, 8>

- Node 4: 3 3-stars
  - <4, 0, 9>, <4, 3, 9>, <4, 9, 0>

- Node 9: 2 3-stars
  - <9, 0, 4>, <9, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 3 + 2] = [7], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <1, 0, 8>
- <4, 0, 9>
- <4, 3, 9>
- <4, 9, 0>
- <9, 0, 4>
- <9, 2, 4>
