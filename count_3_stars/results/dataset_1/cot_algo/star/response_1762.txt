Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 7}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, and 8: <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 6, and 8: <3, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph, which gives us the final answer as [2].
