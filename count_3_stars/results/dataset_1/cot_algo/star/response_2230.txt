Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 3, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
