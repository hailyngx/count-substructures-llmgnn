Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 1, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10.
Therefore, the [10] 3-stars in this graph are: <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 2)>.
