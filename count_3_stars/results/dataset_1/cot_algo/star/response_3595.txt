Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1: {3, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 7, 8}

Now, we will determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 3 and Node 5 have enough neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 3 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 20 = 24, which we represent as [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (7, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (7, 3, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 2)>
<5, (8, 6, 2)>
