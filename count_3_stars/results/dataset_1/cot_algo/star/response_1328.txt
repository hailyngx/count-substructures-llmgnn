Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {0, 2}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's search for 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star with itself as the center and {6, 8, 1} as the leaves.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star with itself as the center and {6, 8, 0} as the leaves.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: 
- <8, (0, 4, 7)>
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 8, and the unique 3-stars are <0, (7, 8, 3)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, and <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>.
