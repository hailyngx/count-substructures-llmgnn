Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can first list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {4, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 8}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Since only nodes 0, 1, and 4 have 3 or more neighbors, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3 in total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4)>
- <1, (4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
