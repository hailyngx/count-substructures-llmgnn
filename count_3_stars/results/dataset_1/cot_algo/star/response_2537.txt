Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 7}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up, we get: 
\[ [1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [44] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 44.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (3, 9, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
