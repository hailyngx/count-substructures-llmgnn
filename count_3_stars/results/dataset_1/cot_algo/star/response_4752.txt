Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the set of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 6}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding them up: 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26. So, there are a total of 26 3-stars in this graph.

List of unique 3-stars:

- <0, (2, 3, 8)>

- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>

- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
