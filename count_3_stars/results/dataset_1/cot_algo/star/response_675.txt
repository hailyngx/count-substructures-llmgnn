Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 9
Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7
Node 3: 1, 6
Node 4: 0, 9
Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 2, 6
Node 8: 0, 6
Node 9: 1, 4, 5

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 1: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 3: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
