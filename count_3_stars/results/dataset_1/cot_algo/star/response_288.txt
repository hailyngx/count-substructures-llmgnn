Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we first need to find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor = {1}
- Node 1: Neighbor = {0, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbor = {4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbor = {8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor = {2}
- Node 5: Neighbor = {2}
- Node 6: Neighbor = {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor = {1}
- Node 8: Neighbor = {3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor = {3, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
  - <6, (1, 2, 8)>
  - <6, (1, 2, 9)>
  - <6, (1, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 8, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have [1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 6)] = [6].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, and <6, (2, 8, 9)>.
