Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5
Node 1: 2, 3
Node 2: 1, 9
Node 3: 1, 4, 7
Node 4: 3, 6, 8
Node 5: 0, 9
Node 6: 4, 9
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 4, 9
Node 9: 2, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 7), so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
Node 4 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 8), so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (3, 6, 8)>
Node 9 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 8), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4] = [6], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>.
