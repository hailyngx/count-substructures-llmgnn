Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 4 neighbors: 2, 3
- Node 5 neighbors: 6, 8
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 3, 6, 8
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
