Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5: inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars (3 or more neighbors)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1+35 = 36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>

<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>

<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
