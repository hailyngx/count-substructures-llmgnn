Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the provided information, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph as follows:

Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 5, 7
Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 3, 7
Node 2 has neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 8
Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4
Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5
Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 1 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 2 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 6 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 7 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = [3]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (3, 4, 8)>
