Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 5, 6

Now, let's check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors in order to form 3-stars. Nodes 0, 3, and 6 satisfy this condition.

For node 0:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, 3: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 4, 9: <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 3, 4: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 3, 9: <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 4, 9: <0, (3, 4, 9)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, 4: <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 4, 6: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 4, 7: <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 4, 8: <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 6, 7: <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 6, 9: <3, (4, 6, 9)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 5, 9: <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 7, 9: <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 5, 7, 9: <6, (5, 7, 9)>

Considering all the unique 3-stars found, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
