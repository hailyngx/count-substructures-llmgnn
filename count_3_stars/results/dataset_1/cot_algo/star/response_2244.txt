Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 9.

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
From the list above, the nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 35 + 10 + 4 = 62 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
