Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 5, and Node 8 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, and Node 7 have 3 neighbors each.

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

In total, there are \( 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \) 3-stars.
These 3-stars are:

- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12].
