Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4
- Node 9: 1, 2, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: <9, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, we have a total of 4 unique 3-stars: 
<2, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 9)>, 
<8, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 7)>.

The total number of 3-stars is 4, so the final answer is [4].
