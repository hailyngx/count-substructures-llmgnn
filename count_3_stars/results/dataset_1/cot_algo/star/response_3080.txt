Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [8] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <5, (7, 8, 1)>
- <5, (7, 8, 2)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
