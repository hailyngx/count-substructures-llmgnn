Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 2, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 13

Therefore, the final result is [13].
