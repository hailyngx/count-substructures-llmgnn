Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8
Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 7
Node 3: 1, 2, 6
Node 6: 2, 3, 8, 9
Node 7: 2, 8, 9
Node 8: 1, 6, 7
Node 9: 6, 7

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, and 3: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, and 6: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, and 6: <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, and 8: <6, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 6, and 7: <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 7, and 8: <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 6. So, the answer is [6].
