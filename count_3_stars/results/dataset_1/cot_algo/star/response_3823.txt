Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 8: No neighbors
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 7}

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [12]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
