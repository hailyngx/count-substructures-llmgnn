Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 4

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 9: has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
