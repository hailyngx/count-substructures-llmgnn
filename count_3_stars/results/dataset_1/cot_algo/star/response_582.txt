Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 7. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>

So, the final result is: [7], and the unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>.
