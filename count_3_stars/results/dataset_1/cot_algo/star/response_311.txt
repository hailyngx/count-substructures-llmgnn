Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <0, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <5, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <5, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <5, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <5, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <5, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <5, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <5, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <5, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <5, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <6, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <6, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <6, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (3, 5, 7)>

Adding them up, we get a total of 19 3-stars in this graph: [19].
