Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
