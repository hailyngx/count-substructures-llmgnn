Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 8
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>
