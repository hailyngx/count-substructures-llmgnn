Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbor {1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}

Nodes 8 and 10 do not have any neighbors listed in the provided edges information. Therefore, they are isolated nodes and do not participate in forming any 3-stars.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed and list the unique ones:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars involving node 3: <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>

- Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
