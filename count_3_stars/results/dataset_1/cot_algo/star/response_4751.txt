Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}

Next, we will look at the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1] = [6]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
