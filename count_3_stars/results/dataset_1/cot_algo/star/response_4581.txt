Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: [1] <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 2: [1] <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 3: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: [1] <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 5: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: [4] <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 9: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>.
