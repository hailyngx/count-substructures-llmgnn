Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 9
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars. Using the \( \text{inom}(n, 3) \) formula for each node with three or more neighbors, we have:
- Node 0 has \( \text{inom}(6, 3) = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 54 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 3, 9)>
