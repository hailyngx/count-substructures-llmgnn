Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, thus [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (7, 0, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
