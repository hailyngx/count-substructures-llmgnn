Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: (3, 4, 5)
- Node 1: (4)
- Node 2: (6, 7, 8)
- Node 3: (0)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 5, 7)
- Node 5: (0, 4, 9)
- Node 6: (2, 9)
- Node 7: (2, 4)
- Node 8: (2)
- Node 9: (5, 6)

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, and 5 have 3 neighbors.
- Node 2, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star each
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars each

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 15 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
