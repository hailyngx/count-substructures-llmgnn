Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 8), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>.
  
Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [4] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>.
