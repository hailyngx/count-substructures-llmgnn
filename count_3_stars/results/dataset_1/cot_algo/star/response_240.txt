Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 3, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 2 neighbor nodes, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 3 has 2 neighbor nodes, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbor nodes, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 9 does not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \[1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 8)>.
