Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 12.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
