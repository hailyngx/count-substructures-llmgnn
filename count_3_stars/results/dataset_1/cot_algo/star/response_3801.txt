Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: (5)
- Node 3: (4, 6, 7)
- Node 4: (3, 7)
- Node 5: (0, 6, 7)
- Node 6: (3, 5, 9)
- Node 7: (3, 4, 5)
- Node 9: (6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
