Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 3

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \(\binom{1}{3}\) = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \(\binom{1}{3}\) = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \(\binom{1}{3}\) = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 0, so the final answer is [0].
