Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 8}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 9}
- Node 6: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [ \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) ]
- Node 1: [ \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) ]
- Node 3: [ \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ]
- Node 4: [ \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) ]
- Node 6: [ \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) ]
- Node 8: [ \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) ]
- Node 9: [ \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ]

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 = 16]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 4, 5, 7)>
