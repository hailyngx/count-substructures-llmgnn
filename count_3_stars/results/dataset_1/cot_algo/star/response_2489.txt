Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 2
Node 2: 1, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 4, 8, 9
Node 4: 3, 5
Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 9
Node 6: 5, 8
Node 7: 0, 2, 8
Node 8: 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, and <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
