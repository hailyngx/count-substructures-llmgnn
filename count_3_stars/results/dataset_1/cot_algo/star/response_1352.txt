Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 1: neighbor {2}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbor {5}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 6: neighbor {0}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 8}

Next, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 3 have 2 or fewer neighbors, so they cannot form 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form 3-stars.
- Node 8 and Node 9 have 2 neighbors, so they cannot form 3-stars.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Total 3-stars = [1]

Therefore, the unique 3-star found is:
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
