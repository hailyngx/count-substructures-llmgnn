Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: Neighbor is 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 7, 8
- Node 3: Neighbor is 5
- Node 5: Neighbors are 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 7, 8
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 5

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 8 3-stars: [8]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 6, 8>
<5, 3, 7>
<6, 0, 7>
<7, 1, 2>
<7, 1, 5>
<7, 2, 5>
<7, 5, 6>
<7, 6, 8>
