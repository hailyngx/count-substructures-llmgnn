Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)> are two of the 3-stars formed.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <4, (0, 2, 3)> is one of the 3-stars formed.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <6, (1, 2, 3)> is one of the 3-stars formed.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have:
10 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 6) = 18 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the answer is [18] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, and <6, (1, 2, 3)>.
