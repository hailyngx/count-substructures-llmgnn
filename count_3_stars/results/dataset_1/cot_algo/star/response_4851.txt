Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph described has the following structure:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8. So, <0, (5, 7, 8)>.
- Node 1 does not have 3 or more neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 2 does not have 3 or more neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9. So, <3, (4, 6, 9)>.
- Node 4 does not have 3 or more neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 5 does not have 3 or more neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 6 does not have 3 or more neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 7 does not have 3 or more neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 8 does not have 3 or more neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 9 does not have 3 or more neighbors for a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 2, which we will represent as [2].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 7, 8)> and <3, (4, 6, 9)>.
