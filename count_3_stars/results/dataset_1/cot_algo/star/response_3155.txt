Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first need to determine the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 1 neighbors: 7
- Node 2 neighbors: 6, 7
- Node 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 3
- Node 6 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 3, 4, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 10 neighbors: None

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: 0 (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0 (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0 (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: 0 (has no neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
