Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 6, 7)
- Node 1: forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 6, 8)
- Node 3: forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 6, 7)
- Node 4: does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 6: forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 1, 3)
- Node 7: forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 3, 4)

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
