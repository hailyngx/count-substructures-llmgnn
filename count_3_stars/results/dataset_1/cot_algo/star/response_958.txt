Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 and Node 9 both have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [19] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
