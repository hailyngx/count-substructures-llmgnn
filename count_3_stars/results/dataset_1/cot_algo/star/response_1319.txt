Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 3-stars, represented as:
[10]

These unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
