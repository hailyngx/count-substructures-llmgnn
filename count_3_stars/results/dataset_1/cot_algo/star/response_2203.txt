Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph described has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13 \) 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final result is [13] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 0, 7)>, <5, (4, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>.
