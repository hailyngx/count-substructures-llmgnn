Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

          0 --- 3 --- 9
          |     |     |
          4 --- 1 --- 7
           \         /
             \  6  /
               \ |
                 5
                 |
                 2
                 |
                 8

Now, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4}

Now, we'll identify the 3-star formations:

- Node 1 forms the 3-star <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 forms the 3-star <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms the 3-star <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Since each of these nodes has exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 unique 3-star formed with each of them.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
