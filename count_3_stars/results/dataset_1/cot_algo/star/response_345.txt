Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

There is only 1 3-star in this graph, which is:

[1]
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
