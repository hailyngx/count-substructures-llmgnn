Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges in a clearer way:

- Node 0 is connected to Node 3
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8

Now, we will find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (3, 4, 5, 6, 8). There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 1 as the center:
   - <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>

2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (5, 6, 8, 9). There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 2 as the center:
   - <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>

3. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (0, 1, 4, 5, 8). There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 3 as the center:
   - <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>

4. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (1, 3, 5, 8). There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 4 as the center:
   - <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>

5. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (1, 2, 3, 4, 9). There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 5 as the center:
   - <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>

6. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (1, 2, 3, 4, 9). There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 8 as the center:
   - <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>

7. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (2, 5, 6, 8). There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 9 as the center:
   - <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Add up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( [10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [52] \)
