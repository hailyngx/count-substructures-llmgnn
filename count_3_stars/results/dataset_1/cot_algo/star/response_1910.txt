Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1 3-star <(1, 3, 6)>
- Node 4: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1 3-star <(2, 4, 9)>, 1 3-star <(5, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 2, so the final answer is [2].
