Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 7}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if any 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 9)>

Since there are 3 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
