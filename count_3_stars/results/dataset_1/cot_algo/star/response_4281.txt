Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 8
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 2, 5

Next, we'll check for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: Forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: Does not form any 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 8) = 12

Therefore, the final result inside brackets is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<(0, 2, 3, 4, 7), 8>
