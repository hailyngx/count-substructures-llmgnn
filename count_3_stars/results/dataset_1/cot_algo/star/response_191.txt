Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:

(0) -> {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
(1) -> {2, 3, 4}
(2) -> {0, 1, 4}
(3) -> {0, 1, 6, 8}
(4) -> {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
(5) -> {0, 6}
(6) -> {0, 3, 5, 8}
(7) -> {4, 8, 9}
(8) -> {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
(9) -> {7, 8}

Now, we apply the \( \binom{n}{3} \) calculation for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

Total number of 3-stars: [20 + 10 + 20] = [50]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
