Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we can identify the 3-stars formed in the graph using the approach mentioned earlier.

First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (6, 7, 8)>

There are no other nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, so there are no additional 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
