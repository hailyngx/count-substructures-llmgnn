Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
