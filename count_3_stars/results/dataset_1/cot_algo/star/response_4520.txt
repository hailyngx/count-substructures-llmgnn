Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we first determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 49

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [49], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>.
