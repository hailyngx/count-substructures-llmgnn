Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
  - <1, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <1, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
  - <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 7, and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, and <9, (3, 4, 5)>.
