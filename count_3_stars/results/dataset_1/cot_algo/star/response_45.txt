Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {7, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 8}

From the neighbor sets, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of 5 3-stars in the graph, which can be represented as:
[5]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>
