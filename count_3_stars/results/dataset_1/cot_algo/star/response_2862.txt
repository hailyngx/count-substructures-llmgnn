Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars.

For Node 1, as it has 7 neighbors, there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
For Node 4, as it has 6 neighbors, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For Node 8, as it has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 35 + 20 + 4 = 59 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [59], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (8, 4, 5)>
