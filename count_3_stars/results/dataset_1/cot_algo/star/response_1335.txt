Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 7
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 6, and Node 8 each have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- For Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9, which we denote as [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 7, 6)>
- <8, (5, 7, 6)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
