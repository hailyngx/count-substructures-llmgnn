Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 and Node 8 have 3 neighbors.
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 7 have 3 neighbors.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0 and Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
