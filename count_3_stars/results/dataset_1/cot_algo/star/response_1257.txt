Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 4, and 8 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars each.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- No other nodes have at least three neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\(120 \times 4 + 4 = 484\)

Therefore, there are 484 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>
