Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7

Next, let's look at nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 8, 9 (4 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with this node)
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9 (3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with this node)
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 8 (4 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with this node)
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8 (3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with this node)
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6 (3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with this node)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7 (5 neighbors, so we can form 10 3-stars with this node)

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars we can form, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 15 3-stars. 
Hence, the final answer is [15], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 2, 3, 7)>
