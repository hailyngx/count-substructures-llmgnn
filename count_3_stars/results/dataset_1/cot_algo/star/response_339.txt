Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors so can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors so can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors so can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors so can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34 \)

Therefore, the final result is [34] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <1, (7, 8, 5)>
- <1, (7, 9, 5)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 9, 5)>
- <7, (8, 9, 5)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>
- <9, (1, 7, 5)>
- <9, (7, 8, 5)>
