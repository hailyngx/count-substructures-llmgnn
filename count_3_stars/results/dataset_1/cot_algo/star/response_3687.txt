Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 5, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 9, <8, (1, 5, 9)> 

The total number of 3-stars is [7].
