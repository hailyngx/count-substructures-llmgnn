Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 5

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  
Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

- There are 10 3-stars with node 0 as the center:
  - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
  - <0, (1, 4, 2)>
  - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <0, (1, 5, 4)>
  - <0, (1, 5, 9)>
  - <0, (1, 5, 4)>
  - <0, (1, 7, 4)>
  - <0, (1, 7, 3)>
  - <0, (1, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
