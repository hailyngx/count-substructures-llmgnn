Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} (8 neighbors)
- Node 4: Neighbor {3} (1 neighbor)
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)

Now we will count the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 56 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1] = 71. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (3, 9, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 3)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <6, (1, 5, 3)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
