Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 7, 8}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node having 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 40 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
