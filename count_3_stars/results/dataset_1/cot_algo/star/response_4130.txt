Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3}

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors, and then calculate the number of 3-stars each node participates in:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 26

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
