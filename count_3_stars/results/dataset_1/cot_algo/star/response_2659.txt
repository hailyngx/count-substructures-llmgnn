Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 3

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. The number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1, so we put it inside brackets [].
The unique 3-star found is <8, (2, 5, 7)>.
