Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors in order to find the 3-stars:
- Nodes 1, 2, 7 have 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 1, 2, 7 each contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = \( (4+4+4+1) = 13 \)

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [13].

List of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
