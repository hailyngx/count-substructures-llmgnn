Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 3, 4, 7

Now let's check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 3 and Node 5 have 3 neighbors, so we can form 2 3-stars from each of them.
- Node 4 and Node 9 have 3 neighbors, so we can form 2 3-stars from each of them.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, there are 4 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<3, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)> 

Putting the final number inside brackets, the answer is: [4].
