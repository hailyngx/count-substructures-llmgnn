Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms four 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
