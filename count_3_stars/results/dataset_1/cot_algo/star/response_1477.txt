Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars)
- Node 2: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) (3-stars)
- Node 3: Node 3 has only 4 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (3-stars)
- Node 9: Node 9 has only 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 35 + 10 = 49 \)

Therefore, the final result is [49] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
