Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are nodes 2 and 6
- Node 1: Neighbors are nodes 4, 6, and 8
- Node 2: Neighbor is node 0
- Node 3: Neighbor is node 4
- Node 4: Neighbors are nodes 1 and 3
- Node 5: Neighbors are nodes 6, 7, and 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are nodes 0, 1, and 5
- Node 7: Neighbors are nodes 5 and 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are nodes 1, 7, and 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are nodes 5 and 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9: <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 9: <8, (1, 7, 9)>

There is a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
