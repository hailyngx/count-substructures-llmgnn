Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 9
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

In total, there is 1 3-star in the graph.

The unique 3-star found is: <7, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
