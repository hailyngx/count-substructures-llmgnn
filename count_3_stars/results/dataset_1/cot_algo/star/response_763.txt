Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 8}
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 6}

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
