Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 9
- Node 7: 3, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 6, 8

Next, we need to determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

From the neighbor sets, we see that nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, and <8, (1, 3, 9)>.
