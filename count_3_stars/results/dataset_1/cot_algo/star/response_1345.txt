Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 4}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars each forms:
- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 5)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (7, 2, 0)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
