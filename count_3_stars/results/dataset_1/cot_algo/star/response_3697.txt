Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Now, let's check each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so we have \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star
- Node 6: 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star

Total 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10, which can be represented as [10].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 6, 3)>
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 5)>
- <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
