Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 1: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 3: <(3, 0, 6)>
- Node 4: <(4, 0, 6)>
- Node 6: <(6, 2, 8)>, <(6, 3, 8)>, <(6, 4, 8)>, <(6, 7, 8)>, <(6, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 8: <(8, 1, 3)>, <(8, 2, 6)>, <(8, 3, 6)>, <(8, 4, 6)>, <(8, 6, 7)>, <(8, 7, 9)>
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors).

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <(3, 0, 6)>
- <(4, 0, 6)>
- <(6, 2, 8)>
- <(6, 3, 8)>
- <(6, 4, 8)>
- <(6, 7, 8)>
- <(8, 1, 3)>
- <(8, 2, 6)>
- <(8, 3, 6)>
- <(8, 4, 6)>
- <(8, 6, 7)>
- <(8, 7, 9)>
