Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {3}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 6, and they are:
<[0, 1, 2], [2, 3, 7], [2, 3, 9], [2, 4, 6], [0, 2, 8], [1, 2, 6]>
