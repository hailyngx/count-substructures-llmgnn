Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 6

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 27 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [27] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>
