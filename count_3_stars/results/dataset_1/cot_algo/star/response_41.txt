Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 9: 6

Next, we will identify the 3-stars. Node 3 and Node 5 both have 3 or more neighbors, so we can apply the combination formula inom{n}{3} to each of them:

- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 = 5]. The unique 3-stars found are <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, and <5, (2, 3, 6)>.
