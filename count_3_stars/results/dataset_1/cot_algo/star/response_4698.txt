Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's identify the 3-star graphs:

- Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: 
    - <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>,
    - <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 2)>, <0, (5, 6, 2)>, <0, (2, 7, 6)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 2 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: 
    - <2, (5, 6, 7)>

- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: 
    - <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>

- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: 
    - <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 0)>

Adding them all up, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 19 3-stars, so the final answer is [19].
