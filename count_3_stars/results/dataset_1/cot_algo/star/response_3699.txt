Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 3, 5, 6
Node 1: 6, 8
Node 2: 4, 5, 7
Node 3: 0, 9
Node 4: 2, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 2
Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 2, 6
Node 8: 1, 4, 6
Node 9: 3, 4, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

For Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
For Node 1: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
For Node 3: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
For Node 5: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
For Node 7: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For Node 8: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For Node 9: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up the 3-stars we found: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 6, 9)>
