Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 5, 7
Node 1: 4, 9
Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 3: 0, 2
Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 7
Node 5: 0, 4, 8
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 0, 4
Node 8: 2, 5
Node 9: 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. These are <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (6, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. These are <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (5, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.

There are a total of 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [6]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (6, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, and <4, (1, 2, 5)>.
