Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 9}.  [1 3-star]
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 8, 9}.  [1 3-star]
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 6, 1}.  [1 3-star]
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 5}.  [1 3-star]

Summing up, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 1)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>.
