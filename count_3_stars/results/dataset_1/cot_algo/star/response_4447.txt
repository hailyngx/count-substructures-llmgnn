Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 8
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 6

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9. For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 (with neighbors 1, 2, 8)
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 (with neighbors 3, 6, 0)
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0 (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{10}{3} = 120 (with neighbors 2, 5, 7) and also inom{4}{3} = 4 (with neighbors 5, 8, 9)
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 (with neighbors 3, 5, 6)
- Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0 (has less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 120 + 4 + 4] = 130. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 1, 2, 8>
- <2, 3, 6, 8>
- <6, 5, 7, 8>
- <6, 5, 8, 9>
- <6, 7, 8, 9>
