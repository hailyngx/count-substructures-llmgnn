Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
We'll first find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 15

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
