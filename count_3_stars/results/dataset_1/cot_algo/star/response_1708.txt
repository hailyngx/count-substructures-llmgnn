Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars found:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so there are 4 3-stars with Node 1. Unique combinations: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), so there is 1 3-star with Node 2. Unique combination: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), so there is 1 3-star with Node 4. Unique combination: <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), so there is 1 3-star with Node 5. Unique combination: <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), so there is 1 3-star with Node 6. Unique combination: <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), so there is 1 3-star with Node 8. Unique combination: <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), so there are 10 3-stars with Node 9. Unique combinations: <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of [19]. 
Unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>
