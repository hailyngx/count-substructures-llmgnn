Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4
- Node 6: 0, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 8

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, 9: <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 6, 8: <3, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars for this graph is [2].
