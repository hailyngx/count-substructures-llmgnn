Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 2

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: There are only 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
