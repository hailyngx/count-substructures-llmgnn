Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5), (0, 2, 5), (0, 5, 8), (1, 2, 5), (1, 5, 8), (2, 5, 8), (0, 1, 8), (0, 2, 8), (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7), (0, 7, 9), (6, 7, 9), (0, 1, 9)>
