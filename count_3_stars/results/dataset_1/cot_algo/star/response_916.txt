Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find all 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 3, 4, and 7
- Node 1: Neighbors are 6 and 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0 and 5
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 8, and 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0 and 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 2 and 7
- Node 6: Neighbor is 1
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0 and 5
- Node 8: Neighbor is 3
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 3, and 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  - <0, (2, 3, 4)>
  - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
  - <0, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <0, (3, 4, 7)>

- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  - <3, (0, 8, 9)>

- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  - <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1] = 6, and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, and <9, (1, 3, 4)>.
