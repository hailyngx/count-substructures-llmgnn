Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 0, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 3 forms three 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
