Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 4, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 5 (1 neighbor)
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 (6 neighbors)
- Node 6: 5, 8 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0, 6 (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0, 4 (2 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is [29] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>.
