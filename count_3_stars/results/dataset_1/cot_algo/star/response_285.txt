Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0, has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: 
    - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <0, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <0, (3, 4, 5)>
    - <0, (3, 4, 9)>
    - <0, (3, 5, 9)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 9)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 1, also has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars:
    - <1, (0, 3, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <1, (2, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (7, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <1, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <1, (0, 3, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (7, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <1, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 also have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 1 3-star each:
    - <4, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [33]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
