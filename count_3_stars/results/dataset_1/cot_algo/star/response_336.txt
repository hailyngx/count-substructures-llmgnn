Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 0, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7, so [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
