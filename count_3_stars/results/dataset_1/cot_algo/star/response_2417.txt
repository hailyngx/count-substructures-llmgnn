Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 3, 8, 9
Node 1: 3
Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 3, 6
Node 6: 5, 7, 9
Node 7: 3, 6
Node 8: 0, 3
Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [23].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 9, 6)>
<3, (0, 8, 7)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 9, 7)>
<3, (0, 8, 6)>
<3, (0, 9, 7)>
<3, (1, 0, 8)>
<3, (1, 0, 9)>
<3, (1, 9, 6)>
<3, (8, 0, 9)>
<3, (8, 0, 7)>
<3, (8, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 9, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 6)>
<3, (9, 7, 6)>
<3, (0, 9, 6)>
<3, (3, 0, 5)>
<3, (3, 6, 5)>
<3, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (3, 5, 6)>
