Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 8, 9: <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, 5: <8, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 8, 9)> and <8, (1, 3, 5)>.
