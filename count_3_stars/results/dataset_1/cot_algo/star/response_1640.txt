Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5} (degree = 2)
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 6} (degree = 3)
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 7} (degree = 3)
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 7} (degree = 3)
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 9} (degree = 4)
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 9} (degree = 3)
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 9} (degree = 3)
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 7} (degree = 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate for them.
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 9, 6)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
