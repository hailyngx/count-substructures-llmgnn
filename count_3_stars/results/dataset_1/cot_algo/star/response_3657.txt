Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For node 0: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <0, (2, 6, 9)>

For node 2: It has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 4: It has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>

Adding up the 3-stars, we have [1 + 20 + 10] = 31.
