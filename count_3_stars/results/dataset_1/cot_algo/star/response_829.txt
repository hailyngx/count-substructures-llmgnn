Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are:

- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {1}

Based on the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 4 and 5 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in.

For Node 4:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For Node 5:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 = 5.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>

So, the final answer is [5].
