Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 22.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 5)> and <8, (0, 3, 9)>.
