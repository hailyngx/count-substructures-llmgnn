Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 7

Now, we look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1 and Node 5 both have 4 neighbors, so they each form \( \text{{inom}}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 and Node 7 both have 6 neighbors, so they each form \( \text{{inom}}{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 20 + 20] = 48 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
