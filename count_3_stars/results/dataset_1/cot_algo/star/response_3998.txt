Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 = 9
So, we have [9] 3-stars and the unique ones are:
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
