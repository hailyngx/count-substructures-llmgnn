Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 9}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (4, 5, 9) - <5, (4, 9)>
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (0, 5, 8) - <9, (0, 8, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars are <5, (4, 9)>, <9, (0, 8, 5)>.
