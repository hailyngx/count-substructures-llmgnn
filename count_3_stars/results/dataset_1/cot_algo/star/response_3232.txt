Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 9
- Node 5: Neighbor is 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 2
- Node 7: Neighbor is 5
- Node 8: Neighbor is 3
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: (\( inom{3}{3} \)) = 1 3-star
- Node 1: (\( inom{4}{3} \)) = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: (\( inom{4}{3} \)) = 4 3-stars
- Node 3:  No 3-stars can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-stars can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-stars can be formed as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 8: No 3-stars can be formed as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 9: (\( inom{4}{3} \)) = 4 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (2, 1, 4)>.
