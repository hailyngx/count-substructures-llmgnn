Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 14:

[14]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
