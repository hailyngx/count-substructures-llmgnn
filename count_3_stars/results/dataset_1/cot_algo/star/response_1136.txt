Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {7}
Node 1: {6, 8, 9}
Node 2: {4, 6, 7, 8}
Node 3: {7, 9}
Node 4: {2, 7}
Node 5: {8}
Node 6: {1, 2, 7}
Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
Node 9: {1, 3, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves (6, 8, 9)
Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves (4, 8, 7)
Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 2, 4)

So the total number of 3-stars is 3, and the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)> 

Therefore, the answer is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>.
