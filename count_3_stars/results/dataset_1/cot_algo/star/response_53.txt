Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

There is a total of \(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32\) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the answer is [32] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
