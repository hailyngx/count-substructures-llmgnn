Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 0, 4, 9
Node 2: 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 3: 4, 6, 8
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6
Node 6: 2, 3, 4
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 2, 3
Node 9: 1

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10, which we will put inside brackets.

So, the result is: [10]
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 3, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 2)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>
