Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The list of neighbors for each node is as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 8}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 6}.
- Since nodes 1 and 4 have 3 neighbors, they each form 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
