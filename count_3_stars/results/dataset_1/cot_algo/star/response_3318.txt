Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {5, 9}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 7, and we list the unique 3-stars inside brackets as follows:
[7]
<4, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 4)>
