Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 4 and 7
- Node 1: Neighbor is 3
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1 and 5
- Node 4: Neighbor is 0
- Node 5: Neighbor is 3
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0 and 9
- Node 9: Neighbor is 7

Now, let's check for nodes that have three or more neighbors to see if they form 3-stars:

- Node 0: has 2 neighbors
- Node 1: has 1 neighbor
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors
- Node 4: has 1 neighbor
- Node 5: has 1 neighbor
- Node 7: has 2 neighbors
- Node 9: has 1 neighbor

No 3-stars are formed in this graph, as no node has three or more neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [0].
