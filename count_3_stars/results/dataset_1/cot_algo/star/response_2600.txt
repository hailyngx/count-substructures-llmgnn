Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 2, 4
Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 8
Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 8
Node 5: 7
Node 6: 2, 4, 9
Node 7: 0, 5
Node 8: 0, 2, 4
Node 9: 0, 6

Next, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, and 4. These nodes can potentially form 3-stars.

For node 0:
- Total neighbors = 3
=> Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, it can form 1 unique 3-star: <0, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 2:
- Total neighbors = 4
=> Number of unique 3-stars = 4C3 = 4
=> Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>

For node 4:
- Total neighbors = 4
=> Number of unique 3-stars = 4C3 = 4
=> Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4] = 9
Therefore, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars are: <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>.
