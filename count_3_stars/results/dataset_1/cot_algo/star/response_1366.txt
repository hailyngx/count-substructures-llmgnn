Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 10 + 10] = 21 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
