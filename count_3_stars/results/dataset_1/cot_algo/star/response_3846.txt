Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 4, 6, and 9 have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 2 and 5 have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 5 \times 4 + 2 \times 4 + 1 = 21 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
