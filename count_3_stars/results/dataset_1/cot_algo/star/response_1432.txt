Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 0, 6, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
