Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 8, 9
Node 1: 2, 5, 6
Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7
Node 3: 2, 8
Node 4: 5
Node 5: 1, 4
Node 6: 1, 8
Node 7: 2, 8
Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7 
Node 9: 0

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) - <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) - <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 6>
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) - <2, 0, 1>, <2, 0, 3>, <2, 0, 7>, <2, 1, 3>
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) - <8, 0, 3>, <8, 0, 6>, <8, 0, 7>, <8, 3, 6>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 0, 1>, <2, 0, 3>, <2, 0, 7>, <2, 1, 3>, <8, 0, 3>, <8, 0, 6>, <8, 0, 7>, <8, 3, 6>.
