Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- For Node 0: Since it has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star. The 3-star is <0, (1, 3, 7)>.
- For Node 1: Since it has 4 neighbors, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>.
- For Node 2: Since it has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star. The 3-star is <2, (1, 5, 7)>.
- For Node 3: Since it has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star. The 3-star is <3, (0, 5, 8)>.
- For Node 4: Since it has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star. The 3-star is <4, (1, 7, 9)>.
- For Node 5: Since it has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star. The 3-star is <5, (2, 3, 6)>.
- For Node 6: Since it has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star. The 3-star is <6, (1, 5, 9)>.
- For Node 7: Since it has 4 neighbors, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>.
- For Node 8: Since it has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star. The 3-star is <8, (3, 7, 9)>.
- For Node 9: Since it has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star. The 3-star is <9, (4, 6, 8)>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of 15 3-stars: [15].
