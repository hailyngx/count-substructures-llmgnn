Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {1, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [0].
