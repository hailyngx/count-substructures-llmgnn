Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list for better visualization:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 3
- Node 8: 0, 2

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>

\( [] = 20 + 10 = 30 \)
