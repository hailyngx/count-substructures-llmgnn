Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20] = [62] \]

Finally, listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
