Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {0, 2}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {1, 2}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 2 have 3 neighbors or more, so each can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1, Node 3, and Node 9 do not have 3 or more neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 2, and the unique 3-stars found are:
<[0, 2], (2, 4, 6)>
