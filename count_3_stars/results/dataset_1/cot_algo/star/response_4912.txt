Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:

Node 0: 3, 6, 7
Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 2: 1, 6
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 3, 7, 8
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7
Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 8: 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's determine the 3-stars and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 and Node 1 have 3 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they can each form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
