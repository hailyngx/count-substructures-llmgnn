Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
\[ [6] \]

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
