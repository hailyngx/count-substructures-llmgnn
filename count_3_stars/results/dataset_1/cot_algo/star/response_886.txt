Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3
Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 8
Node 3: 0, 6, 7, 9
Node 4: 1, 5, 8, 9
Node 5: 4, 8
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 7
Node 7: 2, 3, 6
Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
Node 9: 3, 4, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 9

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the final answer is [31] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>
