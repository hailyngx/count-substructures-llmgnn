Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {6, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 7}
- Nodes 5 and 9 are not connected to any other node.

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors.
  
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [10]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
