Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the neighbors for each node are as follows:

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 9
Node 2: 1, 9
Node 3: 7, 8
Node 4: 1, 8
Node 5: 6, 7
Node 6: 5, 7
Node 7: 3, 5, 6
Node 8: 3, 4
Node 9: 1, 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 9). This leads to 1 unique 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
