Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following structure:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 5, and 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, and <9, (3, 5, 6)>.
