Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are:

Node 0 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 1 neighbors: 5, 7, 8
Node 2 neighbors: 6, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 8
Node 5 neighbors: 1, 8, 9
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 4
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5
Node 9 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7

Nodes 0, 4, and 8 have exactly 3 neighbors and can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
