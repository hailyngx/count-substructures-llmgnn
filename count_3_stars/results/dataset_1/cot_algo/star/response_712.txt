Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 8

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 2, 5, 6, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has exactly 1 neighbor, so it also cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 5, which we put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 6)>
- <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
