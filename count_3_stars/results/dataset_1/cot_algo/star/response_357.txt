Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves {7, 8, 9}
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves {8, 9, 1}
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves {8, 9, 6}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves {9, 0, 5}
- Node 9 forms 4 3-stars:
  1. {0, 2, 5}
  2. {6, 7, 8}
  3. {7, 8, 0}
  4. {8, 5, 9}

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 1)>, <7, (8, 9, 6)>, <8, (9, 0, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 0)>, <9, (8, 5, 9)>.
