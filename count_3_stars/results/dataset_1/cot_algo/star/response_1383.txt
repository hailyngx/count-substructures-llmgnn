Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 4, 8
Node 1: 2, 7, 8
Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 7
Node 3: 0, 8
Node 4: 0, 2, 9
Node 6: 2, 7
Node 7: 1, 2, 6
Node 8: 0, 1, 3
Node 9: 4

Next, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

Node 0: Forms 1 3-star
Node 1: Forms 1 3-star
Node 2: Forms 1 3-star
Node 4: Forms 1 3-star
Node 7: Forms 1 3-star

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [5] \)

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
