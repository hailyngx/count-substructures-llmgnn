Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find all the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 8

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have 4 neighbors, so we can form 4 3-stars with each of them.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with it.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
4 * 5 + 1 = 21

So, the total number of 3-stars is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
