Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 7
Node 1: 2, 3, 6
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 7: 0, 4, 5
Node 8: 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1: 3 neighbors (forms 1 3-star)
Node 2: 5 neighbors (forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars)
Node 3: 6 neighbors (forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars)
Node 4: 5 neighbors (forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars)
Node 5: 4 neighbors (forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars)
Node 6: 5 neighbors (forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars)
Node 8: 4 neighbors (forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars)
Node 9: 4 neighbors (forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars)

Adding up these counts: 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (8, 4, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
