Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {1}
- Node 3: neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {5}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 1, 4}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes which can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Cannot form a 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: Can form a 3-star with nodes {2, 5, 8} => <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 3: Can form a 3-star with nodes {6, 7, 9} => <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: Cannot form a 3-star (has exactly 3 neighbors, no additional 3-star can be formed)
- Node 9: Can form a 3-star with nodes {3, 7, 0} => <9, (3, 7, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 0)>.
