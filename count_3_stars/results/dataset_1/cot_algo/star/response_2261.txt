Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7

Now, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 
\[ [4 + 10 + 1 + 20] = 35 \]

Thus, we have a total of 35 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <1, 8, 3>
- <7, 8, 9>
- <8, 0, 9>
- <8, 2, 5>
- <8, 2, 7>
- <8, 3, 7>
- <8, 5, 7>
