Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 8}

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of 30. So the final result is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>
