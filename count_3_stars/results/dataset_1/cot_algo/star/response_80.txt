Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9: Does not form any 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
