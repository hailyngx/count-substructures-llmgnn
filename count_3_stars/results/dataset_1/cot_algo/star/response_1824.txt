Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 5}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {4}

Next, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 6}: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 8}: <4, (1, 5, 8)>

Since each of these nodes only forms one unique 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
