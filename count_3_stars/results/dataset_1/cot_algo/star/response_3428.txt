Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

Node 1: 8
Node 2: 6
Node 5: 7, 8
Node 6: 2, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 5, 6
Node 8: 1, 5, 6
Node 9: 6

Now, we can see that nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

So there are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, 8, 5>
<5, 8, 6>
<6, 8, 1>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
