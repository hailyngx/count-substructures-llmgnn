Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {2, 8}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [7]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 7, 4)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
