Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 1, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, and Node 4 can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Each of the four nodes can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  So, a total of 4 * 1 = 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
