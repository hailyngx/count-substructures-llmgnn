Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Starting with the given graph, we can determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2 and 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 6, and 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 5, and 8
- Node 3: Neighbors are 5 and 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 2, 3, and 9
- Node 6: Neighbor is 1
- Node 7: Neighbor is 3
- Node 8: Neighbor is 2
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, and 5

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 and Node 2 each form one 3-star since they have exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 3, Node 5, and Node 9 each can form a 3-star since they have more than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 3 = 5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (2, 0, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
