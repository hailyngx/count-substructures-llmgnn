Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
