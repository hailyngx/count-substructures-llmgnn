Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 6
- Node 1 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 3, 6, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 1
- Node 5 neighbors: 3, 6, 8
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 8
- Node 8 neighbors: 3, 5, 7
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9

For these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1 has exactly 4 neighbors, so it will have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it will have 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has exactly 6 neighbors, so it will have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it will have 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has exactly 6 neighbors, so it will have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it will have 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has exactly 4 neighbors, so it will have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>.
