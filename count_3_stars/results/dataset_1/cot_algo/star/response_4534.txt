Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 2, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star formed
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars formed <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 5)>, <2, (1, 9, 5)>
- Node 3: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars formed
- Node 4: [inom{1}{3}] = 0 3-stars formed
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star formed
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars formed <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 1, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars formed <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star formed
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars formed <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [31]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 5)>, <2, (1, 9, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 1, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <
