Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star formed
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 10 = 15]

Unique 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>
