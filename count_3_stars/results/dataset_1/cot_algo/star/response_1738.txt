Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information about the graph, we first need to identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Following the method described, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: \( C(3,3) = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: \( C(5,3) = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: \( C(3,3) = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: \( C(3,3) = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13. Thus, we can represent the unique 3-stars found as:

[<1, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>]
