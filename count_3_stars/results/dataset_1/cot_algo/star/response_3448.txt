Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, the 3-star graph can be identified by examining nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. 
Here are the steps to find the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors or more:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 42

Inside brackets []: [42]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
