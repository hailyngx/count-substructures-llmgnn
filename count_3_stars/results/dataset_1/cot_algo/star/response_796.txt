Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 5, and Node 8 each have 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, and <8, (0, 3, 5)>.
