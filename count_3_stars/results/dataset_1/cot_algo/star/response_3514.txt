Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor of nodes 3 (1 neighbor)
- Node 1: Neighbors of nodes 3, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: Neighbors of nodes 6, 7, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: Neighbors of nodes 0, 1, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4: Neighbors of node 6 (1 neighbor)
- Node 5: Neighbors of nodes 7, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 6: Neighbors of nodes 2, 4, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: Neighbors of nodes 1, 2, 5, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: Neighbors of nodes 2, 3, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: Neighbors of nodes 5, 6 (2 neighbors)

Now, we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 7, 8
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 8, 7

There are a total of 2 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (6, 7, 8), (3, 1, 7)>.
