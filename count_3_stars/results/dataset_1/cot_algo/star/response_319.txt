Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list all the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 5: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

In total, there are \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36 \) 3-stars in this graph.

So, the answer is [36] with unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 5)>
