Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1] = [27] \)

Hence, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>
