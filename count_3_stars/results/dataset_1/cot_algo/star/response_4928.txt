Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 6}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 7}

Now, we will find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 4, and 8: <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 4, and 9: <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 8, and 9: <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 8, and 9: <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, and 9: <2, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
