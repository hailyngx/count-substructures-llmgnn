Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 7)
- Node 1: 6 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (nodes 7, 9)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 6, 8, 1)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 6, 8)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 7: 6 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 6, 7)

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 50 [20 + 10 + 20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
