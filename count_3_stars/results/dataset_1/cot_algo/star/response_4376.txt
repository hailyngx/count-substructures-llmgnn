Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 8

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20

Summing up: 
10 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 35

Therefore, there are 35 total 3-stars in this graph.

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 9)>
