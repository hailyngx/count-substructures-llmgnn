Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(C(3,3) = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \(C(3,3) = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \(C(4,3) = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(C(4,3) = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(C(4,3) = 4\) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is:
\[ [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [14] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
