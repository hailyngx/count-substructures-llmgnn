Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 8
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0, 2, and 4 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 6 and 7 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [ (4 \times 4) + (1 \times 2) ] = [18] \]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>
