Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 5, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 = 22 = [22]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
