Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 7  
Node 1: 3, 9  
Node 2: 0  
Node 3: 1, 5, 8  
Node 4: 0, 9  
Node 5: 3, 6  
Node 6: 0, 5  
Node 7: 0, 8, 9  
Node 8: 3, 7  
Node 9: 1, 4, 7  

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars  
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star  
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)  
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)  
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)  
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star  
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (2, 4, 6)>  
<0, (2, 4, 7)>  
<0, (2, 6, 7)>  
<0, (4, 6, 7)>  
<3, (1, 8, 9)>  
<7, (8, 9, 4)>
