Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 6) + 10 (from node 7) = 16
Therefore, the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 8)>
<7, (5, 0, 8)>
<7, (5, 0, 4)>
<7, (8, 5, 0)>
