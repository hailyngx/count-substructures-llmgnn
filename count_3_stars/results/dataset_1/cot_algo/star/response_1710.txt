Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:

1: 2, 4, 7, 9
2: 1, 9
3: 7, 8
4: 1, 7
5: 7
6: 7, 9
7: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
8: 3, 7
9: 1, 2, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
