Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7}

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 1 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.
  
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 3-stars.
  <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>

- Node 6 also has 5 neighbors, forming 5 3-stars.
  <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 6 + 5] = 13.
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>.
