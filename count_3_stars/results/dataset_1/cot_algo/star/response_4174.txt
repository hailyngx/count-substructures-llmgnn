Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
   <0, (4, 5, 9)>

2. Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
   <2, (3, 7, 8)>

3. Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   <5, (0, 3, 4)>
   <5, (0, 4, 8)>
   <5, (3, 4, 8)>
   <5, (0, 4, 7)>

4. Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
   <8, (1, 2, 6)>
   <8, (1, 2, 9)>
   <8, (1, 5, 6)>
   <8, (1, 6, 9)>
   <8, (1, 6, 8)>
   <8, (2, 5, 6)>
   <8, (2, 5, 9)>
   <8, (2, 6, 9)>
   <8, (5, 6, 9)>
   <8, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 10] = 16. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 8, 9)>.
