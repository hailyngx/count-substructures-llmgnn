Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 5}
Node 1: {0, 2, 9}
Node 2: {1, 4, 8}
Node 3: {9}
Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}
Node 5: {0, 4}
Node 7: {4}
Node 8: {2, 4, 9}
Node 9: {1, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 3: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: 1 3-star formed <4, (0, 2, 5)>
Node 5: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 8: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: 1 3-star formed <9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
