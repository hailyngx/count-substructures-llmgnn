Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: 2, 4, 5
Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 2: 0, 7, 9
Node 3: 1, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 1, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 8
Node 6: 1, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 6
Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
Node 9: 2, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that are part of at least one 3-star:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors.

For each of these nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 25

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
