Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
