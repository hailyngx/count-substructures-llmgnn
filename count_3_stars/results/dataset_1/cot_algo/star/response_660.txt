Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors = {7, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors = {6, 9}
- Node 2: neighbor = {6}
- Node 3: neighbors = {4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: neighbor = {3, 6}
- Node 5: neighbor = {6, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: neighbor = {0}
- Node 8: neighbors = {3, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors = {0, 1, 5}

Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
