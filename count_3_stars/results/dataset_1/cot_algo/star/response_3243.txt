Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 8}

Now let's calculate the 3-stars:

- Node 0 and its neighbors form a 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 2 and its neighbors form a 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 and its neighbors form 3-stars: <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
