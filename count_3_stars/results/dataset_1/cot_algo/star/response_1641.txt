Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 7 and 9
- Node 1: neighbors are 3, 5, and 6
- Node 2: neighbors are 4, 7, and 9
- Node 3: neighbor is 1
- Node 4: neighbors are 2 and 5
- Node 5: neighbors are 1 and 4
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 7, and 8
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 2, and 6
- Node 8: neighbor is 6
- Node 9: neighbors are 0 and 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, (3, 5, 6) forming <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, (4, 7, 9) forming <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, (1, 7, 8) forming <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, (0, 2, 6) forming <7, (0, 2, 6)>
  
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
