Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are listed as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we'll count the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

The total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
