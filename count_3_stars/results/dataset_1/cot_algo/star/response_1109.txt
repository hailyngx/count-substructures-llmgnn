Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 1: no neighbors
- Node 2: neighbors {7}
- Node 3: neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbor {8}
- Node 5: neighbor {0}
- Node 6: neighbor {8}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 3, 7}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <8, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <8, (3, 4, 6)> and <9, (0, 3, 7)>.
