Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

0: 1, 4, 7
1: 0, 3, 5, 9
2: 6
3: 1, 4, 8, 9
4: 0, 3
5: 1, 6, 7, 8
6: 2, 5
7: 0, 5, 8
8: 3, 5, 7
9: 1, 3

Now, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars ([]): [13]

The unique 3-stars found (<>) are:
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
