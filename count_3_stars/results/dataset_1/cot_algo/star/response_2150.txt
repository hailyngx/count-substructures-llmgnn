Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbor {9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: Doesn't have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 1: Has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed: <1, (0, 7, 8)>.
- Node 3: Doesn't have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 6: Doesn't have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 7: Doesn't have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 8: Doesn't have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 9: Doesn't have 3 or more neighbors.

Final result:
Total number of 3-stars = [1]
Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
