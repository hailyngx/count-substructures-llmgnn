Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8
- Node 5: 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6, 7

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed with exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: No 3-stars can be formed with exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21 \)

So, the final number of 3-stars is [21], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- <3, (3, 4, 9)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <6, (6, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
