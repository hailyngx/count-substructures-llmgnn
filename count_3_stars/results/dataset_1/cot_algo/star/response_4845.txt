Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7}

Next, we will find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (8, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [9].
