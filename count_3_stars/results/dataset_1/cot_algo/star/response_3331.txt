Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 0, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 3, 6

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [10]

Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (6, 9, 0)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 0)>
