Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 4, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 7, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
