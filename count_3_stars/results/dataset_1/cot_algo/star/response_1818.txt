Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 8)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (Nodes 3, 8, 9)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (Node 8)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 8)
- Node 4: 1 neighbor (Node 7)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (Nodes 8, 9)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (Nodes 4, 9)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (Nodes 1, 5, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 1 = 12, which we will represent inside brackets as [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (4, 7, 9)>
