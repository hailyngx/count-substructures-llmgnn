Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 7}


Next, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each such node:

- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 58, which is represented as [58].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (2, 3, 7)>
