Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 3
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 4, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 2, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 3, 5, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-stars based on the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 9)
- Node 2: 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 5)
- Node 3: 3-star with nodes (0, 7, 9)
- Node 7: 3-star with nodes (3, 8, 9)
- Node 9: 3-star with nodes (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 7), (1, 3, 8), (1, 7, 8), (3, 5, 7), (3, 5, 8), (3, 7, 8)

Count of unique 3-stars: 5
List of unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>.

The total number of 3-stars is [11].
