Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, we'll identify the 3-star patterns:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 4)> 

Summing up, there are 6 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [6].
