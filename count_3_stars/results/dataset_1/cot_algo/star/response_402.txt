Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 40

So, the final answer is [40] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
