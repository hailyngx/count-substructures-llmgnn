Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 7
Node 1: 2, 6
Node 2: 1, 6
Node 3: 7, 8, 9
Node 4: 8
Node 6: 1, 2, 8
Node 7: 0, 3
Node 8: 3, 4, 6
Node 9: 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 1: <1, (2, 6, 8)>
Node 2: <2, (1, 6, 8)>
Node 3: [1]
Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 8)>
Node 8: [1]

Total number of 3-stars: [2]
