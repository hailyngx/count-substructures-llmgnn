Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {4}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {3, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph based on the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 4}. <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 9}. <4, (1, 5, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
