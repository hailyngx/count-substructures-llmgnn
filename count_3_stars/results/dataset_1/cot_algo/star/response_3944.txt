Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6}

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Ineligible (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 1: Ineligible (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 2: Ineligible (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 3: Ineligible (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 4: Ineligible (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 5: Ineligible (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: Ineligible (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: Ineligible (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 9: Ineligible (has 3 neighbors)

Now we will count the number of 3-stars. For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, the formula \( \text{inom}(n, 3) \) is applied:

- Node 5: \( \text{inom}(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}(3, 3) = 1 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
