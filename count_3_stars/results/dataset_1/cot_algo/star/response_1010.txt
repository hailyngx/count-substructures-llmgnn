Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:  
Node 1: 5, 7, 9  
Node 2: 4, 8  
Node 4: 2  
Node 5: 1  
Node 6: 7  
Node 7: 1, 6  
Node 8: 2, 9  
Node 9: 1, 8  

Now, we need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:  
Node 1 and Node 7 have 3 neighbors each.  

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:  
Since Node 1 and Node 7 have 3 neighbors each, we will have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star for each of them.  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (5, 7, 9)>  
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
