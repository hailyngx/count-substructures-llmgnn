Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 1: {3, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {4}

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors (3, 4, 5) => <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors (2, 7, 9) => <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors (4, 5, 6) => <7, (4, 5, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, and they are:
<[2, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>]
