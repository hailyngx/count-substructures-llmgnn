Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 25
So, the final answer is [25] 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
