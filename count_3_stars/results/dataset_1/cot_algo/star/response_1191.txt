Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 4, 9  
Node 1: 9  
Node 2: 0, 8  
Node 3: 7, 8  
Node 4: 0, 5, 6  
Node 5: 4  
Node 6: 4, 8, 9  
Node 7: 3, 8, 9  
Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9  
Node 9: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8  

Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star  
Node 2: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)  
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star  
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star  
Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars  
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars  

Total 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 23 ([])

Unique 3-stars:  
<0, (2, 4, 9)>  
<4, (0, 5, 6)>  
<6, (4, 8, 9)>  
<8, (2, 3, 6)>  
<8, (2, 3, 7)>  
<8, (2, 6, 7)>  
<8, (3, 6, 7)>  
<8, (6, 7, 9)>  
<9, (0, 6, 7)>  
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
