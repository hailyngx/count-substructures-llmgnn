Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 8
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 0, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 6, 7, 8

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 18 \), so the final result is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
