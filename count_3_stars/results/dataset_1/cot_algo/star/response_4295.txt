Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, here are the calculations:

Node 0 has neighbors: {6, 7, 9}
Node 2 has neighbors: {3, 5}
Node 3 has neighbors: {2, 7, 9}
Node 4 has neighbors: {7}
Node 5 has neighbors: {2, 8}
Node 6 has neighbors: {0, 9}
Node 7 has neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 9}
Node 8 has neighbors: {5, 9}
Node 9 has neighbors: {0, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms 3-stars with (6, 7, 9)
Node 2 forms 3-stars with (3, 5, 8)
Node 3 forms 3-stars with (2, 7, 9)
Node 9 forms 3-stars with (6, 7, 8)

Since each of the nodes has at least 3 neighbors and can form a 3-star, the total number of 3-stars is 4, which we represent as [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
