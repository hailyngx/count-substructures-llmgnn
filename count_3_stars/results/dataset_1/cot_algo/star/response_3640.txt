Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
