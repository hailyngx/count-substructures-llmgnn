Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's check for 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
  <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>
  
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
  <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>,
  <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>
  
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
  <6, (2, 5, 9)>
  
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
  <8, (5, 7, 9)>
  
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10 + 1 + 1] = 16.
