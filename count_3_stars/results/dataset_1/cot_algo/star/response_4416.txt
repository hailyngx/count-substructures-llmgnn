Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 6

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 8, and 9: <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 8, 9, and either 0 or 2: <5, (0, 8, 9)> and <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 4, and 1: <9, (1, 4, 6)> 

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have a total of 4 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [4].
