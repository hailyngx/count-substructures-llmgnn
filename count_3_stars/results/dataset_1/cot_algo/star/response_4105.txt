Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 0
Node 2 neighbors: 4, 6, 7
Node 3 neighbors: 4, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 4
Node 7 neighbors: 2, 8
Node 8 neighbors: 7
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 3

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 2, 4, and 7 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (Note: Node 7 only has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are: <2, (4, 6, 7)>
