Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
