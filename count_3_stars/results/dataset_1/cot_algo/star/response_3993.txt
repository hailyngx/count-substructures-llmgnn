Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 7
Node 1: 2, 6
Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 3: 6
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 1, 3, 8
Node 7: 0, 2, 8
Node 8: 6, 7
Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>.
