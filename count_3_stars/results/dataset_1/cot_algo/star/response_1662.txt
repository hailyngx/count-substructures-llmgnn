Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 1: 3, 6, 8
Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 8
Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6
Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 7
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 7
Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 7
Node 9: 0, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 5 neighbors

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 36 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
