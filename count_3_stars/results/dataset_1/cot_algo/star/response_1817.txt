Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a table to represent the neighbors of each node:

| Node | Neighbors       |
|------|-----------------|
| 0    | 8               |
| 1    | 3, 4, 5         | 
| 2    | 4, 5, 7, 8, 9   |
| 3    | 1, 4, 6         | 
| 4    | 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9|
| 5    | 1, 2, 8         |
| 6    | 3, 4, 7, 8      |
| 7    | 2, 4, 6         |
| 8    | 0, 2, 5, 6      |
| 9    | 2, 4            |

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

1. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are:
   <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>,
   <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
   
2. Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are:
   <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>,
   <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>,
   <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>,
   <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>

Adding these up, we get a total of \( [10 + 20] = 30 \) 3-stars in the graph.
