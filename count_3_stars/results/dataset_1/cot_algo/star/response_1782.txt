Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 3, 6
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: neighbors are 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 8
- Node 4: neighbor is 5
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 6: neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: neighbors are 6, 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 3, 5
- Node 9: neighbors are 2, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, 6: <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, 5: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, 9: <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, 2: <6, (0, 1, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
