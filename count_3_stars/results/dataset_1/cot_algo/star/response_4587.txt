Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 9
- Node 7: 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7
- Node 9: 3, 5

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 0, 8, and 9 each have 2 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [10]

Unique 3-stars:
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
