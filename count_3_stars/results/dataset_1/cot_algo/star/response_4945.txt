Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbor {8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 5, 0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbor {0, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 13 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 13, and the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>
