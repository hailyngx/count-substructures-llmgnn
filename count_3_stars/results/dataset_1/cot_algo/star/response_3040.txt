Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {0, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 6}

We can see that node 0, node 2, and node 3 have 7, 6, and 5 neighbors respectively, so they can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [35 + 20 + 10] = [65] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
