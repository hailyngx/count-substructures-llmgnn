Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 8}

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors, and compute the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \([1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 11\).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
- <9, (7, 8, 0)>
