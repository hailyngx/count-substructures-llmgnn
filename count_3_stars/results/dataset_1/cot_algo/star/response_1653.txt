Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 8: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, we'll check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1, 7, and 8 each have 3 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars (as it only has 2 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2, and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 5, 7)> and <8, (2, 4, 9)>.
