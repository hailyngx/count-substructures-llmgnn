Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {0, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 7}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 neighbors, forms 4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 neighbors, forms 4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 neighbors, forms 4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 7: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) (6 neighbors, forms 20 unique 3-stars)
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 neighbors, forms 4 unique 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
