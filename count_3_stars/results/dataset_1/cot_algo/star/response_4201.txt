Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 and Node 7 have three or more neighbors.

For Node 3, the number of 3-stars it can form:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For Node 7, the number of 3-stars it can form:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 = 8, which can be represented as [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
