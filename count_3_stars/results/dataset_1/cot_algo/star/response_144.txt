Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
    - <1, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <1, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (3, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
    - <3, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
    - <5, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <5, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <5, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <5, (4, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
    - <7, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <7, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <7, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - <8, (1, 3, 5)>

Summing up, we have a total of [10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [23] 3-stars in the given graph.
