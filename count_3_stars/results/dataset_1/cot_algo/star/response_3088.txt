Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 16, which can be represented as [16]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, and <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>.
