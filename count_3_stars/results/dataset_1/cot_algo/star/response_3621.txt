Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's find the 3-star structures present in the graph:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 4
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 6
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 7
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 4
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 8, 0

Calculating the number of 3-star structures for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Total number of 3-stars = [inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3}] = [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 7, 4)>
<2, (6, 7, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6], and they are listed above.
