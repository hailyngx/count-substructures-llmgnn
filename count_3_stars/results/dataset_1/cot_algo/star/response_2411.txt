Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 7}
- Node 2: {8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 6) + 10 (from node 9) = 24 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (8, 6, 7)>
