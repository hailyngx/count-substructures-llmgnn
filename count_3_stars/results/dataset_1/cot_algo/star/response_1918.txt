Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3 neighbors
- Node 5, 5 neighbors
- Node 6, 4 neighbors
- Node 7, 6 neighbors
- Node 8, 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 45

Therefore, the final answer is [45] and the unique 3-stars are as follows:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (7, 9, 5)>
