Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to check for the formation of 3-stars.

For Node 1:
- Neighbors: 4, 9
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

For Node 5:
- Neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Possible 3-star: <5, (6, 7, 9)>

For Node 8:
- Neighbors: 2, 3, 9
- Possible 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 9)>

For Node 9:
- Neighbors: 1, 5, 8
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2] and the unique 3-stars found are <5, (6, 7, 9)> and <8, (2, 3, 9)>.
