Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
  1 -- 9
  |              
  2 -- 3 -- 5
  |         |
  7 -- 8   |
            |
            7
```

Now, we'll denote the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2}

Identifying the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   - 3-stars: <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 also has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
   - 3-stars: <7, (2, 5, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 = 5
Thus, the final result is [5] and the unique 3-stars are <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>.
