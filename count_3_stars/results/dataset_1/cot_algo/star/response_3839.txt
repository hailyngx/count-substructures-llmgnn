Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 5 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 3)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 4)>, <8, (9, 6, 4)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 17

Therefore, there are 17 3-stars found in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 3)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 4)>, <8, (9, 6, 4)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (8, 6, 9)>, <1, (9, 4, 8)> 

Therefore, the final answer is: [17]
