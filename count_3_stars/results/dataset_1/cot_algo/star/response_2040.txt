Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we'll first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>.
