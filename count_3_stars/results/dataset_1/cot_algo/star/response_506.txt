Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 5

Now, we can see that nodes 4 and 8 have 4 neighbors each, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 8, and we can list them:
\[ <4, (0, 6, 7)> \]
\[ <8, (2, 4, 5)> \]

Putting the final number inside brackets, we have:
\[ [8] \]
