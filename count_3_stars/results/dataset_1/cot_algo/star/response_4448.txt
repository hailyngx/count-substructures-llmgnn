Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {5}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 3}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {3, 7}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 1: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 2: Has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (1, 0, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 3: Has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars. <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (1, 0, 5)>, <3, (1, 0, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 3)>, <3, (6, 9, 3)>, <3, (8, 9, 3)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 5: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <5, (1, 0, 2)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 7: Has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 39 3-stars. So, the final answer is [39].
