Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its adjacency list:

Node 0: 5, 7
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 1, 4
Node 4: 2, 5, 9
Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 9
Node 6: 8, 9
Node 7: 0, 5
Node 8: 6
Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 0: Inom{2}{3} = 0  (as it has only 2 neighbors)
For Node 1: Inom{0}{3} = 0  (as it has less than 3 neighbors)
For Node 2: Inom{1}{3} = 0  (as it has only 1 neighbor)
For Node 4: Inom{2}{3} = 0  (as it has only 2 neighbors)
For Node 5: Inom{3}{3} = 1
For Node 6: Inom{2}{3} = 0  (as it has only 2 neighbors)
For Node 7: Inom{1}{3} = 0  (as it has only 1 neighbor)
For Node 8: Inom{1}{3} = 0  (as it has only 1 neighbor)
For Node 9: Inom{2}{3} = 0  (as it has only 2 neighbors)

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [1].

The unique 3-star found is: <5, (0, 4, 7)>
