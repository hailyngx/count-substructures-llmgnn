Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 => inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6 => inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 8 => inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8 also has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7 => inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 5 => 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 23
So, the final answer is [23] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>.
