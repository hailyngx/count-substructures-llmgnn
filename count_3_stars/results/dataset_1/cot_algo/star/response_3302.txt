Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 8

Next, we will identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 1] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
