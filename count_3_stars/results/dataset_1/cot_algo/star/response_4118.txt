Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 0 = 25

Therefore, the final answer is [25] and the unique 3-stars in the graph are <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>.
