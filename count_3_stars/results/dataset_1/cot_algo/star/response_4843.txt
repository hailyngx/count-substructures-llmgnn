Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3}

Next, we'll analyze nodes that have three or more neighbors to find 3-stars:
- For Node 0: 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- For Node 4: 4 neighbors, so 1 3-star can be formed.
- For Node 5: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star can be formed.
- For Node 7: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.

Therefore, inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars is [2].

The 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
