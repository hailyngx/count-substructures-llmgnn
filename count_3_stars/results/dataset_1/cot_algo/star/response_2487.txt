Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node in the graph are as follows:

Node 0: 2, 9
Node 1: 4, 7
Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 1, 7
Node 5: 7
Node 6: 2, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 0, 6

Let's now calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 2)>, <7, (1, 5, 2)>, <7, (4, 5, 2)>.
