Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
Node 0: Neighbors {5}
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 9}
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 8}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 7}
Node 5: Neighbors {0}
Node 6: Neighbors {4, 7, 8}
Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6}
Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
Node 9: Neighbors {1, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star since it has 3 neighbors: (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 9)
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star since it has 3 neighbors: (4, 6, 7)
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star since it has 3 neighbors: (8, 2, 9)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
So, the final answer is [3].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (6, 7)>, <8, (2, 9)>
