Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to calculate the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 6, 7
2. Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5
3. Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 6
4. Node 4 has neighbors: 2
5. Node 5 has neighbors: 2
6. Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 3, 8
7. Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 9
8. Node 8 has neighbors: 6
9. Node 9 has neighbors: 7

We see that nodes 1, 2, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars using these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)> 

So, the final answer is [6].
