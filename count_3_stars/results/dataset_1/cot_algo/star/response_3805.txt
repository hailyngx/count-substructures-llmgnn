Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 9)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 6)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (nodes 4, 7)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (nodes 1, 6)
- Node 4: 6 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 5)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 7, 8)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 7)
- Node 7: 6 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 8)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (nodes 4, 5)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (nodes 0, 7)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 can form a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 4, and 6: <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 can form two 3-stars with its neighbors: <4, (1, 2, 5)> and <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 can form two 3-stars with its neighbors: <7, (2, 4, 5)> and <7, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
