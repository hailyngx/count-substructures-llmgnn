Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 1: has 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 4: has 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 5: has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 6: has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 8: has 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 9: has 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 3, 6)> and <3, (2, 4, 8)>.
