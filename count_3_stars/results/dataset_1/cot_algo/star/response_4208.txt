Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 5

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 and 5 have 3 neighbors, so they will form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, the result is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>.
