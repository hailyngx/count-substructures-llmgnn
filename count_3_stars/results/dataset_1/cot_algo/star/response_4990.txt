Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, and 6: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, and 8: <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 7, and 9: <5, (0, 7, 9)>

Since each of these nodes only forms one unique 3-star, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
