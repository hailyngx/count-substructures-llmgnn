Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13 \)

So, the final result is [13] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>
