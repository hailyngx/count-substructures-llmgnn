Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8

Next, let's find any nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1, 5, and 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0, 6, and 7 have 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15 \), so we put this inside brackets as [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>
- <9, (1, 8, 9)>
- <9, (7, 8, 9)>
- <9, (1, 7, 9)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
