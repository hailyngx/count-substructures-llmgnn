Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 3}

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 6 form a 3-star.
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 8 form a 3-star.
- Node 0, Node 6, Node 8 form a 3-star.
- Node 0, Node 9, Node 2 form a 3-star.
- Node 0, Node 9, Node 3 form a 3-star.
- Node 2, Node 9, Node 3 form a 3-star.
- Node 4, Node 8, Node 6 form a 3-star.
- Node 1, Node 7, Node 5 form a 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 8, and the unique 3-stars found are:
<[0, 2, 6], [0, 4, 8], [0, 6, 8], [0, 9, 2], [0, 9, 3], [2, 9, 3], [4, 8, 6], [1, 7, 5]>
