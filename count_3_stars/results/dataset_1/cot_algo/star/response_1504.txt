Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 9
Node 1: 0
Node 2: 0, 9
Node 3: 8
Node 4: None
Node 5: 6
Node 6: 5
Node 7: None
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 0, 2

Now, we will identify the total number of 3-star configurations:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is also not enough to form a 3-star.

Thus, there is only 1 3-star in this graph, which is represented as <0, (1, 2, 9)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
