Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 28

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
