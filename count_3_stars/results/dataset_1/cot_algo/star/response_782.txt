Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 4, 6}. <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 8, 9}. <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 5}. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 6, 9}. <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 8}. <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 7, 8}. <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>.
