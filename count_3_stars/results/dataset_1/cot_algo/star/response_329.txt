Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 also forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
