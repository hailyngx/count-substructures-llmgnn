Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Considering each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star with leaves (3, 4, 6).
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star with leaves (2, 4, 8).
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with leaves (6, 8, 9).
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
