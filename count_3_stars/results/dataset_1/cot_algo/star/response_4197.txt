Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 19 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [19] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 8>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <8, 4, 5>
