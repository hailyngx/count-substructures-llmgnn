Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we will start by determining the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: (4, 8)
- Node 1: (4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 3: (6, 9)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 5)
- Node 5: (1, 4)
- Node 6: (1, 3)
- Node 7: (1)
- Node 8: (0, 1)
- Node 9: (3)

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars are listed below:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
