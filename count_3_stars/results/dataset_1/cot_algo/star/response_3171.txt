Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 3, 5, 7
Node 1: 2, 9
Node 2: 1, 5, 9
Node 3: 0
Node 5: 0, 2, 7, 8
Node 6: 8
Node 7: 0, 5, 9
Node 8: 5, 6
Node 9: 1, 2, 7

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (No 3-star)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)

So, there are a total of \( [1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [8] \) 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 7, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 7)>
