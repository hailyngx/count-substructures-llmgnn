Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 7, 8
Node 2: 5
Node 5: 0, 2, 8
Node 7: 0, 1, 8
Node 8: 1, 5, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes participate in:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Since each of these nodes forms only 1 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, which is denoted as [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>
