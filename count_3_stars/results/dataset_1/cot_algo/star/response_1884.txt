Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a count of 31 different 3-stars. 

Therefore, the result is:
\[ [31] \]
And the unique 3-stars are:
\[ <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)> \]
