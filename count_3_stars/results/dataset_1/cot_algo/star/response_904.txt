Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars is [5].
