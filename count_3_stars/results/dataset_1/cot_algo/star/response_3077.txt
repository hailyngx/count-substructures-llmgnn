Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 5 and 6
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 4, 7, and 8
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 3, and 8
- Node 3: Neighbors are 2 and 7
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 7, and 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0 and 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0 and 8
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 3, and 4
- Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 2, 6, and 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 4, 5, and 8

Next, we identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1, 4, and 8 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars each.
    - <1, (2, 4, 7)> <1, (2, 4, 8)> <1, (2, 7, 8)> <1, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <4, (1, 7, 9)> <4, (1, 7, 8)> <4, (1, 9, 8)> <4, (7, 9, 8)>
    - <8, (1, 2, 9)> <8, (1, 2, 6)> <8, (1, 9, 6)> <8, (2, 9, 6)>

So, there are a total of 12 unique 3-stars. The final answer is [12].
