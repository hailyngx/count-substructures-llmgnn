Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {2, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6}

Nodes 0, 2, and 9 have 5, 5, and 3 neighbors respectively. So, we can form the following number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21 \]
Thus, there are 21 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)> 

So, the final answer is [21].
