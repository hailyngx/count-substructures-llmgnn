Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: forms 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>
