Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 8
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 2, 6, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 3, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 8, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 3)>
