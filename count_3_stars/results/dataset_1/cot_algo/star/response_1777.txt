Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in adjacency list form:

Node 0: 1, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7
Node 2: 3, 7
Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 4: 3, 6, 7
Node 5: 1, 6
Node 6: 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 7)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (4, 5, 7)>
Node 7 forms two 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 8)> and <7, (2, 4, 6)>

Thus, we have a total of 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, which we will denote as [4].
