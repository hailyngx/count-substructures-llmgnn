Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

Thus, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph, and they are:
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
