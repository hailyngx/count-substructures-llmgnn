Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>
