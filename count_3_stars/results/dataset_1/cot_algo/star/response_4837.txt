Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
The 3-star graph in this case can be counted as follows:

Node 0 has neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5}.
Node 1 has neighbors {2, 6}.
Node 2 has neighbors {0, 1, 8, 9}.
Node 3 has neighbors {0, 4, 6}.
Node 4 has neighbors {0, 3, 5}.
Node 5 has neighbors {0, 4}.
Node 6 has neighbors {1, 3}.
Node 8 has neighbors {2}.
Node 9 has neighbors {2}.

Now, we will calculate the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, hence it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
Node 8 and 9 have 1 neighbor each, so no 3-star is formed.

Total 3-stars formed = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, and <4, (0, 3, 5)>.
