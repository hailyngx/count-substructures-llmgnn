Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 3 have 5 neighbors each, so they each contribute \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \), which we'll represent inside brackets as [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
