Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (2 neighbors, not enough)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (2 neighbors, not enough)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (<6, (1, 4, 5)>)

In this graph, there is only 1 unique 3-star, which is <6, (1, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1].
