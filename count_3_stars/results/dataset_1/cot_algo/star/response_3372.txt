Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have 4 neighbors each.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars from these nodes:
- For each of the nodes with 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with that node as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5 * 4 = 20.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>

Putting the final number inside brackets, we get [20].
