Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \(1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8\), so we have \([8]\).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 4, 2, 7>
- <2, 3, 1, 6>
- <3, 2, 4, 7>
- <4, 0, 6, 8>
- <5, 2, 7, 9>
