Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 2, 4

Next, we need to identify the 3-star configurations. Nodes 1 and 2 have more than 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 = 5].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
