Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors → 1, 4, 5
- Node 1: Neighbors → 0, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors → 3
- Node 3: Neighbors → 2, 7
- Node 4: Neighbors → 0, 6, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors → 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors → 4, 5
- Node 7: Neighbors → 3, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors → 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors → 5

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, 5. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 also forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 6, 8. <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 6, 8. <5, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
