Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22, which we represent as [22].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <2, (5, 7, 0)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (5, 7, 0)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 7, 4)>
- <5, (2, 1, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <5, (4, 1, 7)>
- <5, (4, 2, 7)>
- <5, (4, 7, 0)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 1, 5)>
- <7, (4, 1, 5)>
