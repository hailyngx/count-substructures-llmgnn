Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {7, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 7}

Now, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 each have 5 neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
