Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 44 edges, we will first find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 8}
Node 3 neighbors: {1, 6, 9}
Node 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 7, 8}
Node 5 neighbors: {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
Node 6 neighbors: {0, 3, 7, 8}
Node 7 neighbors: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 8 neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 7 has 7 neighbors, so it can form inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 35 + 10 + 10] = [83]

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 5)>.
