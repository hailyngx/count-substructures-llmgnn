Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following structure:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8
- Node 1 is connected to node 9
- Node 2 is connected to node 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0, we have 3 neighbors (5, 7, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
For node 5, we have 4 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 7, we have 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 8, we have 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 7), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 8) = 13.

So, the final result is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
