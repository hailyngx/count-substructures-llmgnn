Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 4, 7
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 2, 7
- Node 2: neighbors are 1, 7, 8
- Node 3: neighbors are 5, 6
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 6
- Node 5: neighbors are 3
- Node 6: neighbors are 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: neighbors are 2, 6

Now, let's check for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 7
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, 7
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, 8
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars: with neighbors 3, 4, 7 and with neighbors 2, 7, 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and they are <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, and <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>.
