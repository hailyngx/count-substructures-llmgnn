Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 8
Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 4: 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 1, 6
Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 3, 4, 8

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9

Now, we'll apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>.
