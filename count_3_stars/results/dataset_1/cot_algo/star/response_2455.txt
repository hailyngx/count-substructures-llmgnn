Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 3, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, and <3, (2, 7, 9)>.
