Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the final result is [26] and the unique 3-star configurations are:
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
