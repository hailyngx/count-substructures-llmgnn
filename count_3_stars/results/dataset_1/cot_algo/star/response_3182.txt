Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2}
Node 1: {0, 4, 8}
Node 2: {0, 7, 9}
Node 3: {4, 5, 6}
Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 9}
Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 9}
Node 6: {3, 5, 7}
Node 7: {2, 6}
Node 8: {1}
Node 9: {2, 4, 5}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
