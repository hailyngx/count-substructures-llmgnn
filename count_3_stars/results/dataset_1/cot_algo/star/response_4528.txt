Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 3, 8
- Node 1 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 5
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7
- Node 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 8
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 4, 6
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 5

Next, we'll look at the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Potential 3-stars involving node 1: <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, but it cannot form a 3-star as it needs at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, but it cannot form a 3-star as it needs at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, but it cannot form a 3-star as it needs at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, but it cannot form a 3-star as it needs at least 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4, and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>.

So, the final answer is [4].
