Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26, so the final result is [26].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 6)>
