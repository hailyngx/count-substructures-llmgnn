Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {3}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7}

Next, we identify nodes that have at least three neighbors which are nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7. These nodes are capable of forming 3-stars.

For node 0:
- Possible 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 7, 8)>

For node 1:
- Possible 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 5)>

For node 5:
- Possible 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Unique 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 9)>

For node 7:
- Possible 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Unique 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us 4. 
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
