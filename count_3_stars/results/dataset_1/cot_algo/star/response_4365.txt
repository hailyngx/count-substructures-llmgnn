Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 23, which we can represent as [23].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
