Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2, Node 5, and Node 6 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the final answer is [] = 9.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
