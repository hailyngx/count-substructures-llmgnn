Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 9  
Node 1: 4  
Node 2: 0  
Node 3: 5, 9  
Node 4: 1  
Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9  
Node 6: 5, 9  
Node 7: 0, 8, 9  
Node 8: 5, 7  
Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7  

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Nodes 0, 5, and 9 have exactly 4 neighbors which means they can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Therefore, the final result is [12], and the unique 3-stars formed are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
