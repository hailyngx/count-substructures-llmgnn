Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
  0 -- 4 -- 7
  |         |
  9 -- 3 -- 6 -- 1
      |    |    |
      5 -- 6 -- 6
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (4, 9) -> No 3-star formed.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor (6) -> No 3-star formed.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor (3) -> No 3-star formed.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 9) -> 1 3-star formed: <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9) -> 1 3-star formed: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (6, 9) -> No 3-star formed.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) -> 9 3-stars formed: <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (4, 6) -> No 3-star formed.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 6) -> 9 3-stars formed: <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 9 + 9] = 20. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>
