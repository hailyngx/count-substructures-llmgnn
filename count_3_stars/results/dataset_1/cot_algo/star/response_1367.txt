Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors are 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: Neighbors are 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: Neighbor is 0
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 3
- Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4
- Node 9: Neighbors are 3, 4, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 1: Has 3 neighbors, so contributes to 1 3-star
- Node 2: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 3: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 4: Has 4 neighbors, so contributes to \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 6: Has 3 neighbors, so contributes to 1 3-star
- Node 7: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 8: Has 3 neighbors, so contributes to 1 3-star
- Node 9: Has 3 neighbors, so contributes to 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

So, the final answer in brackets is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
