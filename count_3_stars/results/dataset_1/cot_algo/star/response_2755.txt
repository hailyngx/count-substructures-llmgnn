Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 3

Node 1: 3, 4, 8

Node 2: 5, 8

Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8

Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8

Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 7

Node 6: 4, 7

Node 7: 5, 6

Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9

Node 9: 8

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4 and 8: <1, (4, 8)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4 and 5: <3, (4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
