Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 8}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors
- Node 4: has 2 neighbors
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors
- Node 9: has 2 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6, which can be represented as [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
