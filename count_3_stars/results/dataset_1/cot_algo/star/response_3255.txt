Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}

Now let's identify the 3-stars by counting the number of 3-stars around each node:

- Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
  <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>,
  <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, 
  <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, 
  <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>

- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
  <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>,
  <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>

- Node 5: inom{6}{3} = 20
  <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, 
  <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>,
  <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, 
  <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [20 + 10 + 20] = [50] \]
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>,
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>,
<5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>,
<5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>
