Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 3, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star
- Node 5: has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 7: has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 9: has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star

Counting all the 3-stars found, we have a total of 38 3-stars, as shown below:
\[ [38] \]
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>
