Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Since nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 10 + 4 + 1] = [16] \)

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <7, (8, 9, 4)>
- <7, (9, 1, 4)>
- <8, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (4, 5, 8)>
- <8, (5, 7, 8)>
- <8, (7, 0, 1)>
- <9, (1, 4, 9)>
