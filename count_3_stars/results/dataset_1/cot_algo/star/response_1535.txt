Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- For Node 4: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors
- For Node 8: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, so we have [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 8, 9)>
- <8, (7, 8, 9)>
