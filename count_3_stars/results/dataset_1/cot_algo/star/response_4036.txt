Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors -> \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 7 neighbors -> \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 + 35 = 69

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [69], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
