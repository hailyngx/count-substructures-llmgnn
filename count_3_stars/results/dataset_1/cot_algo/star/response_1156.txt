Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 6: {2, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9. 

Therefore, the final result is [9] and the unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <8, (0, 1, 7)>
