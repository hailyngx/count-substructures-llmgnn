Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {3}
Node 1 neighbors: {6, 7, 8}
Node 2 neighbors: {3, 8}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 2}
Node 4 neighbors: {7}
Node 5 neighbors: {7, 9}
Node 6 neighbors: {1, 8}
Node 7 neighbors: {1, 4, 5}
Node 8 neighbors: {1, 2, 6}
Node 9 neighbors: {5}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 1 forms a 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <1, (6, 7, 8)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <7, (1, 4, 5)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <8, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
