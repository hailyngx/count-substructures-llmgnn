Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 0, 3, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 10 = 14, which we denote as [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 3)>
- <1, (4, 8, 3)>
- <1, (6, 8, 3)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
