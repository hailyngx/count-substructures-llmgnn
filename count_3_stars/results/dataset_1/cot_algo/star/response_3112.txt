Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( [4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [24] \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 24.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
