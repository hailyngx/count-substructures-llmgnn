Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2 and 6
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 8, and 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 5, 6, and 7
- Node 4: Neighbors are 5 and 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 3, 4, and 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0 and 3
- Node 7: Neighbors are 3 and 5
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2 and 4
- Node 9: Neighbor is 2

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor (less than 3)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <2, (0, 8, 9)>.
