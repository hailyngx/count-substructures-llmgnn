Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0, 3-stars: 1
- Node 1, 3-stars: 1
- Node 2, 3-stars: 4
- Node 4, 3-stars: 1
- Node 7, 3-stars: 1
- Node 9, 3-stars: 1

Adding them up: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [9]

Therefore, inside brackets [], we have 9 3-stars in total.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (2, 9, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 9, 1)>
- <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 3)>
