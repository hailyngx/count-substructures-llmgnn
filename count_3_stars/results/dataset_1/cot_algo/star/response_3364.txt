Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {1, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 7, and Node 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (1, 2, 6)>
