Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 2
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: neighbors are 3, 8
- Node 5: neighbor is 7
- Node 6: neighbor is 2
- Node 7: neighbors are 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: neighbors are 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: neighbors are 2, 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars is 24, and they are:
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 3, 8)>
