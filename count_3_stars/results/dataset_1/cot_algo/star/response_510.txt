Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 7
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5
- Node 9: 5, 6

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \([1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0] = [7]\)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
