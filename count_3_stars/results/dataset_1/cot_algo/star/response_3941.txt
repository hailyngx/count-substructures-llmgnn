Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 6}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (3, 5, 6)>

<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 1)>
<5, (6, 7, 4)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 4)>
<6, (1, 7, 5)>
<6, (1, 7, 4)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
