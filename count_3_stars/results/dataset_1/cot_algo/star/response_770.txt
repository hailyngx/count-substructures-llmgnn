Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:  
Node 0: 2, 6  
Node 1: 9  
Node 2: 0, 8  
Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9  
Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7  
Node 5: 3, 4, 7, 9  
Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 9  
Node 7: 4, 5  
Node 8: 2, 3  
Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6  

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars (nodes with 3 or more neighbors):  
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
