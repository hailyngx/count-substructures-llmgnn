Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 8
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 7, Node 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 16

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
