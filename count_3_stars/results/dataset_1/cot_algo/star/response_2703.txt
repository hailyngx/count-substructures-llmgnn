Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 2: 0, 4 (degree 2)
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 (degree 6)
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 6: 4 (degree 1)
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 7 (degree 4)
- Node 9: 0, 5 (degree 2)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 4, 7: <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, 7: <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars:
  - With neighbors 0, 2, 6: <4, (0, 2, 6)>
  - With neighbors 3, 5, 8: <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 4, 7: <5, (3, 4, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is [4].
