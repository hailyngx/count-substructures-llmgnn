Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [23]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
- <9, (6, 8, 9)>
