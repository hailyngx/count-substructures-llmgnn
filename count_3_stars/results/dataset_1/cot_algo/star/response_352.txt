Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5
- Node 3: 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 2, 4
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 1, 3

Now, we can see that nodes 1 and 4 have 4 neighbors each. We can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There are a total of 8 3-stars formed by nodes 1 and 4. So, the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
