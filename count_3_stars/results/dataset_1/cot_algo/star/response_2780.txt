Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
