Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 20, so the final answer is [20].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 7, 8)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
