Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 1: 6, 7
Node 2: 6, 7, 9
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 5
Node 5: 3, 4, 7
Node 6: 1, 2, 8
Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 9
Node 8: 6
Node 9: 2, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9: <2, (6, 7, 9)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9: <7, (1, 2, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
