Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node in the graph:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1 and 9.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 4.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 3, 8.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 7, 8.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 6, 9.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 6.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( {6 \choose 3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23 \). 

Therefore, the final answer is [23], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>.
