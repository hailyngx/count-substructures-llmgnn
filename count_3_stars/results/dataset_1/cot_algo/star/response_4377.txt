Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34

So, there are 34 3-stars in total.
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)> 

These are the unique 3-stars that can be formed in the given graph.
