Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 6}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for that node.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
  - <1, (0, 3, 5)>
  - <1, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
  - <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us: \[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 \]

So, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 9, 2)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <7, (2, 8, 3)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>.
