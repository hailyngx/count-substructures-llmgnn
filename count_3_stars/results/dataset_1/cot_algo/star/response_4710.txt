Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-star subgraphs in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, we need to check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 10 = 12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
