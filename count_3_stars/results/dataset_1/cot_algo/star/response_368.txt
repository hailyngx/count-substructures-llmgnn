Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6}

Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 \)

So, there are 42 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
