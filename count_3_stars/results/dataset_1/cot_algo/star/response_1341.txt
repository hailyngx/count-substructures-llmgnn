Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph provided:

```
         0
         |
         1
       / | \
      4  7  8
          | /|\
          8 3 6
          | /
          5
```

Next, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 7

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1, there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- For Node 8, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 5.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (7, 8, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
