Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 8

Next, we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

There are a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final count is [17], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>
