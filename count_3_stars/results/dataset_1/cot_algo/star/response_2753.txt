Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

For each node, let's find their neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 2, 5}  --> <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 5}  --> <9, (1, 5, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
