Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 5, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (5, 6, 9)>
