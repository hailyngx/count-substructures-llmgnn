Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0, 5, 6

We can see that nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate how many 3-stars are formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

There is a total of 4 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is \([4]\).

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
