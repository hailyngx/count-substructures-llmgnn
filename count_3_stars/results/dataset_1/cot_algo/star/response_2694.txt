Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbor nodes {2}
- Node 1: neighbor nodes {9}
- Node 2: neighbor nodes {0, 3, 4}
- Node 3: neighbor nodes {2, 7}
- Node 4: neighbor nodes {2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: neighbor nodes {4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: neighbor nodes {4, 8}
- Node 7: neighbor nodes {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbor nodes {6, 7}
- Node 9: neighbor nodes {1, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 9}

Therefore, we have 4 unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 4)>, <4, (5, 6)>, <5, (7, 9)>, and <7, (8, 9)>.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
