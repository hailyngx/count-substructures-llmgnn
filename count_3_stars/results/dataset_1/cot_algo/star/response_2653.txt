Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 4: 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 6

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There are a total of \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 18 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [18], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (4, 9, 7)>
- <6, (4, 9, 2)>
- <6, (2, 1, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 2)>
- <9, (0, 6, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 6, 4)>
