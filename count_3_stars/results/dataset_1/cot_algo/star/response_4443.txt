Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's first list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars based on the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 1: <1, (2, 3, 8)>
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 2: <2, (1, 4, 5)>
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 3: <3, (1, 4, 6)>
Node 4 has 2 neighbors
Node 5 has 2 neighbors
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 6: <6, (0, 3, 7)>
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed with node 7: <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [7].
