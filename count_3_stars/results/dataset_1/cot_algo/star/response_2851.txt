Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbor {3}

Now, we'll identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are:
   - <4, (1, 5, 6)>
   - <4, (1, 5, 7)>
   - <4, (1, 6, 7)>
   - <4, (3, 5, 6)>
   - <4, (3, 5, 7)>
   - <4, (3, 6, 7)>
   - <4, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <4, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <4, (0, 5, 7)>
   - <4, (0, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
