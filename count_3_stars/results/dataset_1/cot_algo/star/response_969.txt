Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 2: forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 9, and 3
- Node 4: does not have at least 3 neighbors
- Node 6: forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 8, and 7
- Node 8: forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 9, and 6
- Node 9: does not have at least 3 neighbors

In total, there are 3 unique 3-stars:
- <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
