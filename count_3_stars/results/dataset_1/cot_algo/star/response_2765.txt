Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented by the following adjacency list:

0: [2, 3, 5, 7]
1: [8]
2: [0, 8]
3: [0, 5, 7, 8]
4: [8]
5: [0, 3, 9]
6: [9]
7: [0, 3, 8]
8: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
9: [5, 6]

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star <5, (0, 3, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, and <5, (0, 3, 9)>.
