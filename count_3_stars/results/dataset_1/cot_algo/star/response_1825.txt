Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 12. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>

So, the final answer is [12].
