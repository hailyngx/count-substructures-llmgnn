Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Now, let's identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1: forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars, namely <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 4: forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars, namely <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 6: forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 6) = 18

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>
