Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
In this case, nodes 0, 6, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with these nodes using \( \binom{n}{3} \).

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 = 12

So, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
