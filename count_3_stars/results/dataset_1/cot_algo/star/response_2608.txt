Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Now we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, and 3 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:  
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 13 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>  
<1, (2, 3, 9)>  
<3, (0, 1, 4)>  
<8, (0, 4, 6)>  
<8, (0, 4, 9)>  
<8, (0, 6, 9)>  
<8, (3, 4, 6)>  
<8, (3, 4, 9)>  
<8, (3, 6, 9)>  
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
