Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 0
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 1
- Node 3: 2, 6, 2
- Node 4: 1, 2, 1
- Node 5: 1, 2, 8, 1
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 1, 5, 1
- Node 9: 0

Now, we can see that nodes 1, 2, and 5 have 6, 6, and 4 neighbors respectively, which is 3 or more.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 20 + 20 + 4 = 44, which we will denote as [44].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 2, 5)>
- <1, (5, 1, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 1, 5)>
- <2, (5, 1, 8)>
