Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor nodes for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 0, 7

Looking at the neighbor sets, we see that the nodes forming a 3-star are: 0, 7, and 9. So, we have one 3-star in this graph: <0, (7, 9)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
