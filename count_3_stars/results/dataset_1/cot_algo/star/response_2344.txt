Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {4, 6, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {2, 3, 5, 7}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 6, 9}
Node 3 neighbors: {1, 8}
Node 4 neighbors: {0}
Node 5 neighbors: {1, 6, 7, 9}
Node 6 neighbors: {0, 2, 5}
Node 7 neighbors: {1, 5, 9}
Node 8 neighbors: {3}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 7}

Now let's find the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 0: Has 3 neighbors, so there are [1] 3-stars with this node as the center.

Node 1: Has 4 neighbors, so there are [4 choose 3] = [4] = 4 3-stars with this node as the center.
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>

Node 2: Has 3 neighbors, so there are [1] 3-stars with this node as the center.
<2, (1, 6, 9)>

Node 3: Has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars with this node as the center.

Node 4: Has 1 neighbor, so there are no 3-stars with this node as the center.

Node 5: Has 4 neighbors, so there are [4 choose 3] = [4] = 4 3-stars with this node as the center.
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>

Node 6: Has 3 neighbors, so there are [1] 3-stars with this node as the center.
<6, (0, 2, 5)>

Node 7: Has 3 neighbors, so there are [1] 3-stars with this node as the center.
<7, (1, 5, 9)>

Node 8: Has 1 neighbor, so there are no 3-stars with this node as the center.

Node 9: Has 4 neighbors, so there are [4 choose 3] = [4] = 4 3-stars with this node as the center.
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [16]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
