Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 3, 8
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 3-stars: <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 3-stars: <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <8, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7, and they are listed below:
[7]
<3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>
