Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Degree 5)
Node 1: 6, 7, 8, 9 (Degree 4)
Node 2: 0, 4 (Degree 2)
Node 3: 6, 9 (Degree 2)
Node 4: 2, 7 (Degree 2)
Node 5: 0, 8, 9 (Degree 3)
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 7 (Degree 4)
Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 6 (Degree 4)
Node 8: 0, 1, 5 (Degree 3)
Node 9: 1, 3, 5 (Degree 3)

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>

Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4 = 14].
