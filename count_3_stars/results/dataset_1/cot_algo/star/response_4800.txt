Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
From the given edges, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {6}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 6}

Now, we will check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors, and therefore have the potential to form a 3-star:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 16.

Therefore, the answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>.
