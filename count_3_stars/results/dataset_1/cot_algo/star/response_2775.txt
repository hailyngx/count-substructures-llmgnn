Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52 \)

So, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 1, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
