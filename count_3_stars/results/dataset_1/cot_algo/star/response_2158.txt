Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors are 3, 7
- Node 1: neighbor is 4
- Node 2: neighbors are 5, 9
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 5
- Node 4: neighbors are 1, 6
- Node 5: neighbors are 2, 3
- Node 6: neighbors are 4, 7
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 6
- Node 9: neighbor is 2

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, and they are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 5)>.

Therefore, the answer is [4].
