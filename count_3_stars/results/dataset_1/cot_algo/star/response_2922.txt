Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned above:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Since only nodes 1 and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 20 = 30. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
