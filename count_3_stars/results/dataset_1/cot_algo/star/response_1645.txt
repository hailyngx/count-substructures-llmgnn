Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {2, 9}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 9}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {5, 8, 9}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {6, 8}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 8}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {0, 6}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
1. Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
5. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
7. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up these results, we get a total of 49 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is: \[ 49 \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>
