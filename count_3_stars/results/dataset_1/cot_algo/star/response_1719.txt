Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, forms 10 3-stars
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: has 2 neighbors (less than 3, no 3-star)
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = 14.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
