Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5}

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 30 \).

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>
