Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: (3, 4, 6)
- Node 1: (3, 4)
- Node 3: (0, 1, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 9)
- Node 5: (3, 6)
- Node 6: (0, 3, 5)
- Node 7: (3, 8)
- Node 8: (7)
- Node 9: (4)

Following the calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: \( [1 + 10] = 11 \)

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (0, 7, 6)>
- <3, (1, 7, 6)>
- <3, (5, 7, 6)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
