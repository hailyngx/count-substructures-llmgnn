Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 4
Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 2: 0, 6
Node 3: 1, 4, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 5: 1, 4, 7
Node 6: 1, 2, 4
Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 8
Node 8: 3, 7, 9
Node 9: 3, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 5: <1, (6, 7, 5)>
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: 
<3, (4, 8, 9)> 
<3, (4, 7, 8)> 
<3, (4, 7, 1)> 
<3, (9, 8, 1)>
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars: 
<4, (3, 6, 7)> 
<4, (3, 6, 1)> 
<4, (3, 7, 5)> 
<4, (3, 7, 1)> 
<4, (3, 1, 5)> 
<4, (6, 7, 1)>
<4, (6, 1, 5)> 
<4, (6, 7, 5)> 
<4, (7, 5, 1)> 
<4, (6, 7, 5)>
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: 
<7, (4, 8, 3)> 
<7, (4, 8, 9)> 
<7, (4, 9, 3)> 
<7, (8, 9, 3)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9, and 1: <8, (3, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1] = 20.
