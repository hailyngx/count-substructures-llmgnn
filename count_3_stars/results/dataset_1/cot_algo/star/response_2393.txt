Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 8)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (nodes 2 and 5)
- Node 2: 6 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 0)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (nodes 4, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 7, 9)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (nodes 1, 7)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 9)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 3)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 6, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the final result is [38] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (2, 3, 4)>
- <7, (2, 3, 5)>
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
