Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, 9 <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, 9 <7, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
