Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 4, 7
Node 1: 7, 8, 9
Node 2: 3, 4, 7
Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 9
Node 5: 3, 4
Node 6: 3, 8, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 2
Node 8: 1, 6
Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the final result is [14] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
