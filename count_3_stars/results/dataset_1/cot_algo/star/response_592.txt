Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 1, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [33], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>.
