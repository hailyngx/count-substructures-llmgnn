Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 6}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<4, (3, 5, 6)>,
<5, (0, 4, 6)>,
<6, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 9)>.
