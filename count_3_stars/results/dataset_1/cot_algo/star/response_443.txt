Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Calculating the 3-stars in the given graph:

Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 5, 8
Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 7, 8, 9
Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8
Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 4
Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 8
Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 7, 9
Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 4
Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 5
Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4
Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 5

Only node 1 and node 8 have 4 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>.
