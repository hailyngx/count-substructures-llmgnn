Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {3, 8}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {3, 6}
- Node 6: {4, 5}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, skip.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, skip.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These are: <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, skip.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, skip.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, skip.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, skip.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, skip.

Therefore, there are a total of 4 3-stars in this graph: [4]. The unique 3-stars are <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>.
