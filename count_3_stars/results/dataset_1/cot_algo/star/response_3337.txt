Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 3
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: Since it has 3 neighbors, it can be part of a 3-star. Thus, we have 1 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 2, 9)>.

For node 2: Similarly, it has 3 neighbors, so it can also be part of a 3-star. Therefore, we have 1 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 3, 7)>.

For node 3: Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. The 3-stars are: 
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 = 6].
