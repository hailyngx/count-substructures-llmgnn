Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the final result is [33] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
