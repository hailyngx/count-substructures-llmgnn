Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 4
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 3, 8
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
