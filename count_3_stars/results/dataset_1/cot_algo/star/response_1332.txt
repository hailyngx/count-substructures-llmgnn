Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by identifying the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbor {5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 5}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
For these nodes, we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors.
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 17 

Therefore, the final answer is [17] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
