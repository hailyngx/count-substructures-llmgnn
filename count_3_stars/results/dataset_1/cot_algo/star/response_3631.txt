Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 9
Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 8
Node 3: 2, 4, 7
Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 4, 6, 8
Node 6: 2, 5
Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 8
Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
Node 9: 0, 1, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
