Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graph formed from the given data is as follows:
- Total number of 3-stars: [10]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 7, 9)>
