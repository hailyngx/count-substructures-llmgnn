Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 0
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 and Node 6 have 4 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 and Node 6 can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Total 3-stars = 4 + 4 = 8

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (6, 4, 9)>
- <3, (6, 0, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>

So, the final answer is [8].
