Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8

Now, we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, 9: <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, 9: <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, 9: <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, 8: <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, 9: <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, 3: <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, and <9, (0, 2, 3)>.
