Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {5}

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars. From the neighbor sets, we see that nodes 0, 3, 4, and 5 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each.

For node 0: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
