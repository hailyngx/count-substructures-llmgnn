Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 7. 
  There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 6.
  There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2, and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)> 

So, the final answer is [2].
