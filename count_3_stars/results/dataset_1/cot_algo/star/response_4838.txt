Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3
Node 1: 2, 9
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 5: 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 8: 3, 4, 7
Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 3 forms a 3-star with (4, 5, 9)
Node 4 forms a 3-star with (3, 5, 7)
Node 5 forms a 3-star with (3, 4, 7)
Node 7 forms a 3-star with (4, 5, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)> including the one previously listed, and <7, (4, 5, 9)>.
