Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars each node is a part of (if applicable):

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 4: Not applicable
- Node 5: Not applicable
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: Not applicable

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in this graph, and they are:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
