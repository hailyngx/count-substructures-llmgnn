Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
