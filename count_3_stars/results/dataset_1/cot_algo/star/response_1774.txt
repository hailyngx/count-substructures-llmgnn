Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 8)> (1 3-star)
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: <4, (2, 6, 8)> (1 3-star)
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: [2]
Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>
