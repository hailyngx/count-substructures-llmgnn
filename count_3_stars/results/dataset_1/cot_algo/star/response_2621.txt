Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with (1, 3, 5), (3, 5, 8), and (5, 8, 9) -> 3 3-stars
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with (0, 1, 5), (1, 4, 7), (3, 6, 9), and (5, 9, 0) -> 4 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with (0, 2, 9) and (2, 4, 7) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with (0, 6, 8) -> 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 3 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 10
Therefore, the final answer is [10] with the unique 3-stars being <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 9, 0)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, and <9, (0, 6, 8)>.
