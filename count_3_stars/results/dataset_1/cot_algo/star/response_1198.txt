Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 9)
- Node 1: 6 neighbors (Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (Nodes 1, 5, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 6)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 9)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (Nodes 1, 2, 9)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (Nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, 9)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (Nodes 2, 6)
- Node 8: 1 neighbor (Node 2)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (Nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 1)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 5, 6), (3, 6, 7), and (4, 9, 0). (Total: 3)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 6, 7). (Total: 1)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 9, 0). (Total: 1)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 2, 7). (Total: 1)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 6. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 9, 0)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 9, 0)>, and <6, (1, 2, 7)>.
