Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of 16 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
