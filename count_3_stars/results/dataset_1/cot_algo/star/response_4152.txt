Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 60

Therefore, there are 60 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 8>
