Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8
- Node 6: 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars formed are <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 1, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 1, 8)>, <1, (4, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>.
