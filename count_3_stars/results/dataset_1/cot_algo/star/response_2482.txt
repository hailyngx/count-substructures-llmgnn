Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 4, 5
Node 1 neighbors: 3, 4, 6
Node 2 neighbors: 4, 8
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 8
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 4
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 7
Node 7 neighbors: 6, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 3
Node 9 neighbors: 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 3) + 20 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 6) = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
