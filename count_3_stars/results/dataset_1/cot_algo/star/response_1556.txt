Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to calculate the neighbor set for each node:

Node 1 neighbors: {3, 5, 8}
Node 2 neighbors: {5, 7}
Node 3 neighbors: {1, 8, 9}
Node 4 neighbors: {5, 7}
Node 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
Node 6 neighbors: {5}
Node 7 neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
Node 8 neighbors: {1, 3, 7, 9}
Node 9 neighbors: {3, 7, 8}

Now, we look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form 3-stars:

Node 1: forms 3-stars
Node 2: does not form 3-stars
Node 3: forms 3-stars
Node 4: does not form 3-stars
Node 5: forms 3-stars
Node 6: does not form 3-stars
Node 7: forms 3-stars
Node 8: forms 3-stars
Node 9: does not form 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 30 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>
