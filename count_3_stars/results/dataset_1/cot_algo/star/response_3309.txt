Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can represent the graph as follows:

```
0 -- 1 -- 3 -- 9
|         | \
7         5  8
         / \
        2   4
         \
          6
```

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has neighbors {1, 3, 7}.
  - It forms 1 3-star.

- Node 1 has neighbors {0, 3, 5, 6}.
  - It forms 1 3-star.

- Node 3 has neighbors {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}.
  - It forms 1 3-star.

- Node 5 has neighbors {1, 2, 3}.
  - It forms 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
