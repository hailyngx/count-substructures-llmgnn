Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 2, 3, 8
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 8
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 7, 8, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 8
Node 5 neighbors: 7
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 3, 6

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to check for 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, exactly 3, so it forms 1 unique 3-star.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 4 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 2) + 10 (from Node 3) + 1 (from Node 4) = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [19].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
