Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
