Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Next, we'll check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding all the 3-stars, we have a total of [5] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
