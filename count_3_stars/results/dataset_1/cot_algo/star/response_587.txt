Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To determine the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {6, 9}
Node 1: Neighbor {5}
Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 8, 9}
Node 3: Neighbor {7}
Node 4: Neighbors {2, 8}
Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 9}
Node 6: Neighbor {0}
Node 7: Neighbor {3}
Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4}
Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

For Node 2, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars:
<2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>.
