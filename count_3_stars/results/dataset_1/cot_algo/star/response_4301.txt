Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To solve this problem, we first need to construct the adjacency list for each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 8}
Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 7}
Node 2: {1, 6}
Node 3: {5, 7, 9}
Node 4: {0, 5, 6}
Node 5: {3, 4, 7}
Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 8}
Node 7: {1, 3, 5}
Node 8: {0, 6}
Node 9: {3}

Now, we will list the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 4, 8)
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 7, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 4, 8)> and <3, (5, 7, 9)>.
