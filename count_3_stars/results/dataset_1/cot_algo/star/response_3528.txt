Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 5}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 = 12]

Unique 3-stars:
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
