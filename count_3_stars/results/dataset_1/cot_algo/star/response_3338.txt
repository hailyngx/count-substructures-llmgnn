Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the provided graph, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8

Next, we will identify nodes that have three or more neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 7, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of: 

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 35] = 44 \)

Finally, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (9, 7, 6)>, <1, (7, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 9, 2)>, <7, (4, 1, 9)>, <7, (9, 4, 1)>, <9, (1, 5, 2)>, <9, (1, 6, 0)>, <9, (1, 7, 0)>, <9, (1, 8, 0)>, <9, (2, 7, 1)>, <9, (5, 1, 2)>, <9, (6, 0, 1)>, <9, (6, 7, 0)>, <9, (6, 7, 1)>, <9, (6, 7, 4)>, <9, (6, 7, 2)>, <9, (7, 0, 1)>, <9, (7, 1, 2)>, <9, (7, 1, 4)>, <9, (7, 1, 6)>, <9, (7, 2, 1)>, <9, (7, 2, 4)>, <9, (7, 4, 1)>, <9, (7, 6, 0)>, <9, (7, 6, 1)>, <9, (7, 6, 4)>, <9, (7, 6, 2)>, <9, (7, 9, 0)>, <9, (7, 9, 1)>, <9, (7, 9, 2)>, <9, (7, 9, 5)>, <9, (7, 9, 6)>, <9, (7, 9, 8)>, <9, (8, 1, 0)>, <9, (8, 1, 6)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>, <9, (8, 2, 7)>, <9, (8, 7, 1)>
