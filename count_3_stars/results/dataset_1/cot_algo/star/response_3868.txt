Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the neighborhood sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 5}
- Node 3: {7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {4, 5}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 6): <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star with nodes (4, 5, 6): <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star with nodes (0, 1, 8): <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with nodes (1, 2, 8): <5, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
