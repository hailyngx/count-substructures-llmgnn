Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 0, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Now we sum up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14

Putting the final number inside brackets:
[14]

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>
