Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {1, 8}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9) -> 1 3-star
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 6) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

In total, there is 1 + 10 = 11 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final result is [11] with the unique 3-stars being:
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 1, 6)>
- <7, (0, 2, 3)>
- <7, (0, 2, 6)>
- <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 2, 6)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (2, 3, 6)>
