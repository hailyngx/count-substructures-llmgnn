Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
