Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 7 each have 3 neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.
- Node 4 and Node 9 have more than 3 neighbors, so they can definitely form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 7 each can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 16 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
