Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the final result is [16] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
