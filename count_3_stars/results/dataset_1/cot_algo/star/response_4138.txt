Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 7 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (5, 6, 7)>
- <6, (5, 6, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
