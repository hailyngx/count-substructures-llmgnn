Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-star graph representations in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 6}

Now we can determine the 3-star graphs formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms 4 different 3-star graphs: <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 4 different 3-star graphs: <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star graph: <6, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9] and the unique 3-star representations are <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, and <5, (3, 6, 9)>.
