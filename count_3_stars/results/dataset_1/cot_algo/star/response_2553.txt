Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {5, 8, 9}
Node 1: {6, 7}
Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 9}
Node 3: {2, 4, 6}
Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 9}
Node 5: {0, 4, 6}
Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
Node 7: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
Node 8: {0, 6, 7}
Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 7}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([1 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [19]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
