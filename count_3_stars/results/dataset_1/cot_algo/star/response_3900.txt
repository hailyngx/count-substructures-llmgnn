Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the final result is [16] with unique 3-stars <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>.
