Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 6, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8

Next, we'll check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4, 6, and 8 have 3 neighbors each, so we can form 3-stars with these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
