Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbor(4)
- Node 1: neighbors(3, 4, 6, 8)
- Node 3: neighbors(1, 8)
- Node 4: neighbors(0, 1, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 5: neighbor(7)
- Node 6: neighbors(1, 4, 9)
- Node 7: neighbor(4, 5)
- Node 8: neighbors(1, 3)
- Node 9: neighbors(4, 6)

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 4, and 6: <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, and 6: <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 4 also forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 6, and 9: <4, (1, 6, 9)>

Count of total 3-stars = 3
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
