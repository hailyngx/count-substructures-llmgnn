Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>.
