Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Next, we identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 3: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \(20 + 4 = 24\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>.
