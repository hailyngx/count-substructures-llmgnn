Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 9
Node 2: 1, 8
Node 3: 0
Node 4: 0, 5
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 9
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 0, 2, 9
Node 9: 1, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 10.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
