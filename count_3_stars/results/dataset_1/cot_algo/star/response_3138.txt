Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9), so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 7, 9)>.
Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 8), so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 7, 8)>.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 5), so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 5)>.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, and <7, (0, 1, 5)>.
