Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we need to find the number of 3-stars and list them. 

First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [33]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
