Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 3, 4
Node 3: 0, 2, 6
Node 4: 2, 9
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 0, 3
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 0, 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

The other nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed with them.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 9, 0)>.
