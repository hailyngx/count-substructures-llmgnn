Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {3, 4}
Node 1: {2, 6}
Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 8}
Node 3: {0, 9}
Node 4: {0, 6}
Node 5: {2, 7}
Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
Node 7: {5, 6}
Node 8: {2}
Node 9: {3, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
<Node 2, (1, 5, 6)>, <Node 2, (1, 6, 8)>, <Node 2, (5, 6, 8)>, <Node 2, (1, 5, 8)>

Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
<Node 6, (1, 2, 4)>, <Node 6, (1, 2, 7)>, <Node 6, (1, 2, 9)>, <Node 6, (1, 4, 7)>, <Node 6, (1, 4, 9)>, <Node 6, (1, 7, 9)>, <Node 6, (2, 4, 7)>, <Node 6, (2, 4, 9)>, <Node 6, (2, 7, 9)>, <Node 6, (4, 7, 9)>

In total, there are 4 + 10 = 14 3-stars in this graph.  
So, the answer is [14].
