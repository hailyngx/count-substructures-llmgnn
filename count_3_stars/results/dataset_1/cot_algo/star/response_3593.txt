Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 0

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2

Thus, the final answer is [2].
And the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>.
