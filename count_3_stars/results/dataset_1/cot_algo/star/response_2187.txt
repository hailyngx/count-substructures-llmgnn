Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8

Next, we will look at each node that has three or more neighbors to check for possible 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors and cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors and cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 4 + 10 = 14 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 14 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
