Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4}

Next, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
