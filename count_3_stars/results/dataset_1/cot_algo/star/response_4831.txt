Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 9
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>
