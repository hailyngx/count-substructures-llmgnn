Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's build the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 7}

Next, we'll apply the combinatorial calculation to nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 3, as shown below:
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [3] with the unique 3-stars listed as <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, and <9, (5, 6, 7)>.
