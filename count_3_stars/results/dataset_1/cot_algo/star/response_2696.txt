Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, and 6 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For nodes 0, 1, and 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, which can be represented as [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
