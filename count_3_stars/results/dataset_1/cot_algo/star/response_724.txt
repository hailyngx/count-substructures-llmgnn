Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms no 3-star.
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 17

So, the final answer is [17] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (8, 1, 9)>, 
<2, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<4, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<4, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<4, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<5, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 6)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<9, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<9, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<9, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<9, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
