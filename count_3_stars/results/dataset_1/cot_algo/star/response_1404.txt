Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

0: 7
1: 2, 8, 9
2: 1, 3, 4, 9
3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
4: 2, 3, 5, 8
5: 3, 4, 9
6: 3, 7, 8
7: 0, 6
8: 1, 3, 4, 6
9: 1, 2, 3, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 have 4 neighbors
Node 6 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

For nodes with 4 neighbors: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] There are 4 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 6 with 3 neighbors:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \] There is 1 3-star for this node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is:
\[ [6 + 1] = 7 \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>
