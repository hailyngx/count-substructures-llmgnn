Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's map out the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 3, 6, 7, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 7: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 3, 6>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <6, 7, 1>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <8, 9, 1>
- <8, 9, 6>
- <8, 1, 3>
- <8, 1, 6>
- <8, 1, 7>
- <8, 6, 7>
