Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13] with the unique 3-stars as follows:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
