Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors

Now we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing these up: 

\[ [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20] = [31] \]

Therefore, there are 31 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)> 
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (1, 2, 6)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 7, 4)>
- <8, (2, 7, 5)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 9, 1)>
- <8, (6, 9, 5)>
- <8, (7, 4, 5)>
