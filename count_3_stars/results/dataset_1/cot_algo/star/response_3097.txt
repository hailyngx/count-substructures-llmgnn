Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 4}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <0, (3, 4, 5)>.
