Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: 5  
Node 2: 4, 6, 8  
Node 3: 4, 5, 8, 9  
Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9  
Node 5: 0, 3, 4  
Node 6: 2, 8  
Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9  
Node 9: 3, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 8)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 6, 9)

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 25

Therefore, there are a total of 25 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 8, 6)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>
