Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 1, 2

Now, we need to check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
