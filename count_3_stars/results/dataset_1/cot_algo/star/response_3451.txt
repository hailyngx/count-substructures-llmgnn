Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 0, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 1, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors

For each node with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>.
