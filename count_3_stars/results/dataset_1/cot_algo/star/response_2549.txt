Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 7, 8

Nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>
