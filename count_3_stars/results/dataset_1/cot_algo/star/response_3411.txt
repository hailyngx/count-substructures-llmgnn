Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: neighbors are 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 3
- Node 3: neighbors are 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: neighbors are 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 5, 6
- Node 8: neighbors are 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: neighbors are 1, 3, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
   <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>
  
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
   <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 5, 9)>

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center. 
   <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
   <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 8 as the center.
   <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( [4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1] = [29] \).
