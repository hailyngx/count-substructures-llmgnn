Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 1, 6, 7
Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 7
Node 2: 1, 3, 9
Node 3: 2, 5
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 0, 1, 9
Node 7: 0, 1
Node 9: 2, 6

Now, we'll check for nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <0, (1, 6, 7)>.
