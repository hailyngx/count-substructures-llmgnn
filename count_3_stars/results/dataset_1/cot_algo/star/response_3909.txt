Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 9}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {2, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- In this case, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors.
- We can see that nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.
- The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as: \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 16 \)

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [16].
