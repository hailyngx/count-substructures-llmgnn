Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a more visual way:

```
    0
   / \
  7 - 8
 / \ / \
9 - 1 - 5
     | / \
     6 - 2
```

Now, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 9, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 9: <8, (0, 7, 9)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9: <7, (0, 2, 9)>
Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 9: <0, (7, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
