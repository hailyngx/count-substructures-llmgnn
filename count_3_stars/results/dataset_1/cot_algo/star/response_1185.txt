Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 9 (4 neighbors) [\[inom{4}{3}\] = 4 3-stars]
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9 (4 neighbors) [\[inom{4}{3}\] = 4 3-stars]
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 7 (4 neighbors) [\[inom{4}{3}\] = 4 3-stars]
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 8 (4 neighbors) [\[inom{4}{3}\] = 4 3-stars]
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 (6 neighbors) [\[inom{6}{3}\] = 20 3-stars]
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 7 (4 neighbors) [\[inom{4}{3}\] = 4 3-stars]
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 (6 neighbors) [\[inom{6}{3}\] = 20 3-stars]

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
