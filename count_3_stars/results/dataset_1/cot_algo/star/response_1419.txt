Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 7)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (nodes 6 and 9)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 5, and 8)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (nodes 7 and 9)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, and 4)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (nodes 3 and 6)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, and 4)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2, 5, 6, and 7 have 5, 4, 4, and 3 neighbors respectively.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 4 + 4] = [18] \)

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>
