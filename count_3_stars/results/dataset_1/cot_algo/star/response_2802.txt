Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors are 2 and 3
- Node 1: neighbor is 5
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 2, 4, and 8
- Node 4: neighbors are 3 and 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 1 and 8
- Node 6: neighbor is 2
- Node 7: neighbor is 2
- Node 8: neighbors are 3, 5, and 9
- Node 9: neighbors are 2, 4, and 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 16

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<&0, 2, 3> (3-star with the center node as 0 and leaves 2, 3)
<&2, 4, 9> (3-star with the center node as 2 and leaves 4, 9)
