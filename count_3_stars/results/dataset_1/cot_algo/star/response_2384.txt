Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {1, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 8}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {1, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph, and they are:
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
