Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, 7:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>

Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 4, 3:
- <1, (0, 4, 3)>

Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 4, 8:
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>

Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, 2:
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>

Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 5, 8:
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
