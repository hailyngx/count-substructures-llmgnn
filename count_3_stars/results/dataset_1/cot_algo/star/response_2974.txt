Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 7, 8} -> <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 4} -> <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 9} -> <8, (1, 2, 9)>

There are no other 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3, which can be represented as [3].
