Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph you provided, let's first calculate the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 7, 9}
Node 1: {0, 7, 9}
Node 2: {4, 7, 9}
Node 3: {4, 6, 7}
Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
Node 5: {4, 7}
Node 6: {3, 7, 8}
Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Node 8: {4, 6}
Node 9: {0, 1, 2}

Next, we will go through each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in:

Node 0: Does not form any 3-stars.
Node 1: Does not form any 3-stars.
Node 2: Does not form any 3-stars.
Node 3: Does not form any 3-stars.
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: Does not form any 3-stars.
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: Does not form any 3-stars.
Node 9: Does not form any 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \[ 10 + 1 + 20 = 31 \]

Therefore, the final answer is [31] and the unique 3-stars in this graph are <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>.
