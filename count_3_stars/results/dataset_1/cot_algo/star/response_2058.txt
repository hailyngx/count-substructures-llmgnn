Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the answer is [22] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>.
