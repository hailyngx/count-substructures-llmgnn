Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2

Now, let's look at the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and find the 3-stars:
- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <1, (4, 5, 7)>
  - <1, (4, 5, 9)>
  - <1, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 2: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
  - <2, (3, 5, 9)>
  - <2, (3, 6, 9)>
  - <2, (5, 6, 9)>

- Node 3: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  - <3, (0, 2, 6)>

- Node 4: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  - <4, (1, 7, 8)>

- Node 5: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  - <5, (1, 6, 9)>

- Node 6: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <6, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <6, (2, 5, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (5, 8, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [15] \)

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
