Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The edges are: 
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8)
(1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)
(2, 0), (2, 5)
(3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9)
(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 8)
(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
(6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 9)
(7, 1), (7, 3)
(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 9)
(9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Now, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 2: {0, 5}
Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
Node 5: {1, 2, 3}
Node 6: {1, 4, 9}
Node 7: {1, 3}
Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 9}
Node 9: {3, 6, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9}

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed. If a node has exactly 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) (as it has 5 neighbors)
Node 1: \({{6}\choose{3}} = 20\) (as it has 6 neighbors)
Node 3: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) (as it has 5 neighbors)
Node 4: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) (as it has 5 neighbors)
Node 8: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) (as it has 4 neighbors)
Node 9: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) (as it has 3 neighbors)

Adding these up: \(10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 55\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>
