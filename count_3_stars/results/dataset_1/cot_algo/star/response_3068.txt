Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {7, 9}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>
