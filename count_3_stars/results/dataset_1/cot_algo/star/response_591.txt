Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 29. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 29, which can be represented as [29].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
3. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
4. <0, (1, 5, 9)>
5. <0, (2, 3, 5)>
6. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
7. <3, (0, 1, 9)>
8. <3, (0, 2, 5)>
9. <3, (1, 2, 5)>
10. <5, (0, 1, 2)>
11. <5, (0, 1, 7)>
12. <5, (0, 2, 7)>
13. <5, (1, 2, 7)>
14. <9, (0, 3, 7)>
