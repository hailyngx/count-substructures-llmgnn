Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 2, 4, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's check for each node that has three or more neighbors to see if 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them. 
- Nodes 7, 8, and 9 have less than 4 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 21

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
