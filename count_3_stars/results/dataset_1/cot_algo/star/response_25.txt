Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5
- Node 2: 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
  <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, 
  <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 10 = 12, so the final answer is [12].
