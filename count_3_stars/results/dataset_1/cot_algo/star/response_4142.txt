Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16. Therefore, the final result is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <7, (0, 8, 4)>
- <7, (0, 8, 5)>
- <7, (0, 8, 2)>
- <8, (2, 5, 4)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- <8, (5, 4, 7)>
