Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we'll find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 4}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 4 = 15, so we'll put [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>

So, the final answer is: [15], <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>
