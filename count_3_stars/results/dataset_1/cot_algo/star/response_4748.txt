Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \), so the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (4, 6, 8)>
2. <0, (4, 5, 8)>
3. <0, (4, 6, 8)>
4. <0, (5, 6, 8)>
5. <8, (1, 4, 9)>
6. <8, (0, 4, 9)>
7. <8, (1, 5, 9)>
8. <8, (0, 5, 9)>
