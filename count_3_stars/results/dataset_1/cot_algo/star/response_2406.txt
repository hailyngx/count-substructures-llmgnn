Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following structure:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 5.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 8 and a separate one with nodes 0, 2, 9.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 4 and a separate one with nodes 0, 1, 7.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 5.

Counting these, we have a total of 6 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
