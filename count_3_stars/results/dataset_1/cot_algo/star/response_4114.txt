Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the provided edges:
- Node 0: 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 0, 6

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star (with neighbors 8, 9)
- Node 1: 1 3-star (with neighbors 2, 6)
- Node 3: 1 3-star (with neighbors 1, 4)
- Node 4: 1 3-star (with neighbors 5, 6)
- Node 6: 1 3-star (with neighbors 4, 5)

Combining all unique 3-stars, we have:
- [5] total 3-stars
- <0, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <3, 1, 4>, <4, 5, 6>
