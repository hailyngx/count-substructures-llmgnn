Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 60 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [60] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (5, 7, 3)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 3)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
