Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 3, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 2, and Node 5 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30]. 
And the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (1, 2, 9)>
