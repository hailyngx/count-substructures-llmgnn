Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1, which is inside brackets [].
The unique 3-star is <0, (3, 4, 5)>.
