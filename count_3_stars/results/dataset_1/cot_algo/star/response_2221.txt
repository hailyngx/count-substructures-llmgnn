Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 7 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 3 and Node 5 have 3 neighbors each.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40, which we will represent as [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the given graph.
