Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we can determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 8

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 8
- Node 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- <6, (2, 3, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
- <9, (3, 8, 8)>
- <9, (6, 8, 8)>
