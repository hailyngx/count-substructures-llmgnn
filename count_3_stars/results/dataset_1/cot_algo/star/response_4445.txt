Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
We will first find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {6, 8, 9}
Node 1: {2, 7}
Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7}
Node 3: {6, 7}
Node 5: {2, 8}
Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 9}
Node 7: {1, 2, 3}
Node 8: {0, 5}
Node 9: {0, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Putting these together, we have [1 + 4 = 5] total 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
