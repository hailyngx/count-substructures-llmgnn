Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star:
- Node 1: Has 3 neighbors - forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: Has 5 neighbors - forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: Has 3 neighbors - forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: Has 3 neighbors - forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: Has 4 neighbors - forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17

So, the final answer is [17], and the unique 3-stars are: <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (8, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 8, 9)>.
