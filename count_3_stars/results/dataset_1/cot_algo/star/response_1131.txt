Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 6, 7

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 20. 
So, the answer is [20]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>.
