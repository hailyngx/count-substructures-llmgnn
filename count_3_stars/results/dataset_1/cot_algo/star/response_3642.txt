Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 7 (Degree 4)
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8, 9 (Degree 4)
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7, 9 (Degree 4)
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6 (Degree 3)
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8 (Degree 3)
- Node 5: 2, 3 (Degree 2)
- Node 6: 3 (Degree 1)
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4 (Degree 3)
- Node 8: 1, 4 (Degree 2)
- Node 9: 1, 2 (Degree 2)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 8)>
3. Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
