Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 5)>
2. Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 9)>
3. Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 5)>

Total 3-stars = 3

So, the final answer is [3].
