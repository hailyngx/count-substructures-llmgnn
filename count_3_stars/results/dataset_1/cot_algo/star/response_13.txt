Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 8}

Calculating the 3-stars for each node with at least three neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 = 20 \) [<20>]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- <6, (2, 3, 8)>
