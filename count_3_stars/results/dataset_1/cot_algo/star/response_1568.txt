Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 = 9, so we'll put this inside brackets: [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
