Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 and Node 6 each have 4 neighbors, so they form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 8 each have 4 neighbors, so they form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Count of 3-stars: \( [4+4+4+4] = [16] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 7)>
