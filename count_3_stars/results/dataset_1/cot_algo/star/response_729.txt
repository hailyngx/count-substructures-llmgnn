Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph using the method outlined earlier.

First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (4, 9, 6)>

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph. Since there are 2 unique 3-stars found, the final count is [2].
