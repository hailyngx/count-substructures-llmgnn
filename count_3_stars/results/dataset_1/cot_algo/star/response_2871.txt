Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Therefore, we have 1 3-star in the graph, and it is <3, (2, 7, 8)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
