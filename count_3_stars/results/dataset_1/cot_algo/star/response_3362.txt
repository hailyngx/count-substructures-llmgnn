Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with (2, 4, 5), (3, 4, 5), and (4, 5, 8).
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with (0, 2, 4).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, and <8, (0, 2, 4)>.
