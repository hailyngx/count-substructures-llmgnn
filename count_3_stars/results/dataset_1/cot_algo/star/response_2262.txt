Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Next, we'll identify the 3-star configurations:
Since every node must have exactly 3 neighbors in a 3-star graph, we only consider nodes with 3 or more neighbors.

For node 1: 1 3-star
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>

For node 2: 1 3-star
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>

For node 3: 1 3-star
- <3, (0, 7, 8)>

For node 4: 1 3-star
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>

For node 5: 1 3-star
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>

For node 6: 1 3-star
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>

For node 9: 1 3-star
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars gives:
\[ [7] \]
