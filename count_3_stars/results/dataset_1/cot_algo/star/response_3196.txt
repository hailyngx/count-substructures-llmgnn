Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0 and Node 2 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 10 3-stars each.
Node 2 and Node 8 have 6 neighbors each, so they can form 20 3-stars each.
Adding these up gives us a total of 10 + 10 + 20 = 40 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)> 

And the total number of 3-stars is [40].
