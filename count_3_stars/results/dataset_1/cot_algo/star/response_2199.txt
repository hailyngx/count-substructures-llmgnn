Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 2, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 45.

The unique 3-stars formed in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 5)>, <2, (4, 9, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 7, 5)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 2, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, 2)>, <5, (8, 1, 3)>
