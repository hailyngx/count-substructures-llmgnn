Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The list of nodes with their respective neighbors is as follows:

Node 0: 1, 6, 7
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 8
Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 8
Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 7
Node 5: 4, 6
Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 9
Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 9: 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 3, 4, and 6 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 3-stars each.
Node 1, 2, 7, and 8 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + (4*3) = 13

Therefore, there are 13 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 6, 7)>,
<3, (1, 2, 8)>,
<3, (1, 4, 8)>,
<3, (2, 4, 8)>,
<3, (3, 1, 7)>,
<4, (2, 6, 8)>,
<4, (2, 3, 8)>,
<4, (2, 7, 8)>,
<4, (3, 1, 8)>,
<6, (0, 4, 5)>,
<7, (0, 3, 4)>,
<7, (0, 4, 6)>,
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
