Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 5

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
