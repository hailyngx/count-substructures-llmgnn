Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 5
Node 1 neighbors: 3, 6
Node 2 neighbors: 4, 6, 8
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 5
Node 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 8, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7
Node 7 neighbors: 6, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 4
Node 9 neighbors: 4, 7

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 2: 1 3-star
Node 4: 1 3-star
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 6: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
