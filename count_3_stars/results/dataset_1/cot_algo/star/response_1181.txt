Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
   0 --- 1 --- 2
   |          / \
   |         /   \
   9       8     7
            \   /
             \ /
              6
              |
              3
              |
              5
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1:
   - Neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 8
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>

2. Node 2:
   - Neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4] = 8.
