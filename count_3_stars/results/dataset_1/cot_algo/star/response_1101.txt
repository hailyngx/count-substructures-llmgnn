Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 4

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1] = 5.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (7, 5, 0)>
<4, (7, 5, 6)>
