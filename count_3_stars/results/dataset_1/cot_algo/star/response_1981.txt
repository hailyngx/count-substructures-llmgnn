Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 0, node 3, and node 9.

For node 0:
- Neighbors: 4, 5, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 5, 9)>

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>

For node 9:
- Neighbors: 0, 1, 2
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars: [6]
