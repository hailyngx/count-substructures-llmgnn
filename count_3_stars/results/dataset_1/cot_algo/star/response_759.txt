Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 8
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 9
Node 2: 4, 8
Node 3: 1, 4, 5
Node 4: 2, 3
Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 7
Node 6: 5, 9
Node 7: 5
Node 8: 0, 2, 9
Node 9: 1, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 and Node 5 have 4 neighbors each.

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Therefore, there are 8 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)> 

So, the final answer is: [8].
