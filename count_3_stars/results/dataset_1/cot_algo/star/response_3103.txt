Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 5: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 9: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>
