Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 23 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [23] and the unique 3-stars are:

- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
