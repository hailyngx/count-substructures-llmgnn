Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 7

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9), forming 1 3-star: <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6), forming 1 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9), forming 1 3-star: <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 7), forming 1 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
