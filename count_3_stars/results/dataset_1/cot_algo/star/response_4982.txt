Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7, 8

Next, we need to find the 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 9, 2)>, <4, (5, 9, 3)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 1)>, <5, (4, 6, 3)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [14].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 9, 2)>, <4, (5, 9, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 1)>, <5, (4, 6, 3)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>.
