Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of 11 3-stars: [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
