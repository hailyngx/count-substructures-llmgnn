Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 4, 8, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 8
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 8
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 4, 5
- Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 5
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 10 + 10] = [21].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 5, 7)>
<4, (6, 5, 8)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<4, (8, 5, 0)>
<4, (8, 5, 6)>
<4, (8, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 1, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 0)>
<8, (4, 5, 1)>
<8, (4, 5, 3)>
