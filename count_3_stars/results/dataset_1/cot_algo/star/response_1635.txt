Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 6
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

In total, there are 12 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [12].
