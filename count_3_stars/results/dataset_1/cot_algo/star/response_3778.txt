Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 3

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 1] = 5 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
