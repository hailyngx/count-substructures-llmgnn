Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 1: 0, 3, 9 (degree 3)
- Node 2: 0, 6 (degree 2)
- Node 3: 1, 5, 8 (degree 3)
- Node 4: 5 (degree 1)
- Node 5: 3, 4 (degree 2)
- Node 6: 0, 2 (degree 2)
- Node 7: 9 (degree 1)
- Node 8: 0, 3, 9 (degree 3)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7, 8 (degree 4)

Next, let's identify the 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: forms 3-stars with (1, 8, 9) and (2, 6, 8)
- Node 1: forms 3-stars with (0, 9, 8)
- Node 3: forms a 3-star with (8, 9, 1)
- Node 8: forms a 3-star with (0, 9, 1)
- Node 9: forms a 3-star with (0, 8, 1)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, and they are represented as <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 9, 8)>, <3, (8, 9, 1)>, and <8, (0, 9, 1)>. Thus, the final answer is [5].
