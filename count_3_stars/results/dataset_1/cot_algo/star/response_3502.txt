Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 44.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 7, 8)> 
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 6, 7)>
