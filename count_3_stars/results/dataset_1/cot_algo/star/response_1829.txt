Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 9
  - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
