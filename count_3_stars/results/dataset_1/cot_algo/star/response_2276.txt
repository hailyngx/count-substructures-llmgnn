Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 9
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 25 3-stars in the graph:

\[ [25] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
