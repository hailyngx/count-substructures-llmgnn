Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 33 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [33] and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>
