Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 4, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 0 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 0 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars. <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars. <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 5)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 0 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 0 + 0 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 0] = [54]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, 
<5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 5)>
