Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 8
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 5
Node 4: 0, 5
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 6: 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 0, 5, 6
Node 9: 2, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 8
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: none

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 + 1 = 22

Therefore, the final answer is [22] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<6, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>
