Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 4

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 0] = 16

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 16.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>
