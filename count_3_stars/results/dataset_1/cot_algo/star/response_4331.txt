Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 6, 7, 8

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} \) = 0
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} \) = 0
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 6, 8)>
