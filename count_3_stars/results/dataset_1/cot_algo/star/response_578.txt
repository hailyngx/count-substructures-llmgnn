Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star

Finally, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Total 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 5) = 2

So, the final answer is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
