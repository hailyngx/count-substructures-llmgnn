Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 2, 7, 9>
- <1, 5, 6, 7>
- <1, 5, 6, 9>
- <1, 5, 7, 9>
- <1, 6, 7, 9>
- <3, 7, 8>
