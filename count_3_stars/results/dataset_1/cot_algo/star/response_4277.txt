Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3

Next, we'll check each node that has 3 or more neighbors to see if they can form a 3-star.
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 20 + 4 + 1 = 25, and they can be represented as below:
<[0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 1)>]
