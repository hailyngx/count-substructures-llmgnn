Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 5, 6
Node 1: 5, 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 4
Node 3: 4, 6, 9
Node 4: 2, 3
Node 5: 0, 1
Node 6: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 6, 9
Node 8: 1, 6
Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<0, (2, 5, 6)>

Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<1, (8, 9, 5)>

Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 9, 7)>, <3, (6, 9, 1)>, <3, (6, 9, 1)>

Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 1)>, <6, (8, 9, 1)>, <6, (9, 7, 1)>, <6, (9, 7, 1)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 10] = [16]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (8, 9, 5)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 9, 7)>, <3, (6, 9, 1)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 1)>, <6, (9, 7, 1)>.
