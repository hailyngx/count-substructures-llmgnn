Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {3}

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8, which we will represent as [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
