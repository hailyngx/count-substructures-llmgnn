Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 3}. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 8}. <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 6}. <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 7, 9}. <8, (3, 7, 9)>

There are a total of 4 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [4].
