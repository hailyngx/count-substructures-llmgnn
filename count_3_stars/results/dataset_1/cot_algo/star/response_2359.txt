Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and the 3-stars formed:
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (7, 6, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10] 3-stars.
