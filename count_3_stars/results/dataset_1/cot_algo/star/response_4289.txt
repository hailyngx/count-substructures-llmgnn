Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6
- Node 9: 7

Next, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 3 and Node 8 have 3 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2, represented as [2]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 6)>
