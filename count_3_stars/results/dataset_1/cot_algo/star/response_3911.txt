Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32, so inside brackets we have [32].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 9)>
