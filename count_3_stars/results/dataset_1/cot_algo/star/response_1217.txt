Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 7)

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor(4)
- Node 1: Neighbor(2, 4, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 2: Neighbor(1, 4, 7, 8)
- Node 4: Neighbor(0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 5: Neighbor(4, 6, 7)
- Node 6: Neighbor(1, 4, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 7: Neighbor(1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 8: Neighbor(2, 6, 7)
- Node 9: Neighbor(1, 7)

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 35] = 79 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
