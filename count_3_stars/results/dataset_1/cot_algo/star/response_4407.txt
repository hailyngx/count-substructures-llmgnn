Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The central nodes with their neighbor sets are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6}

The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 6, and 9.
For each of these nodes, we can form a 3-star, so the total number of 3-stars is 3.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed is [3].
