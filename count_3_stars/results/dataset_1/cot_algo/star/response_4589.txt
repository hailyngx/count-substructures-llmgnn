Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we will first calculate the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 5, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 5, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 4: neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 38

Therefore, the final result is [38].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
