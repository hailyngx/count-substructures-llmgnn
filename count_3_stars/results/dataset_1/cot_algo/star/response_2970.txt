Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 3, 8
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 5

Next, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

There are no 3-stars formed in this graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [0].
