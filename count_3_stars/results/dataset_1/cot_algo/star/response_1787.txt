Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 8}

We observe that Node 3, Node 4, and Node 8 have 5 neighbors each, which is enough to form 3-stars with them. So, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 10 + 10] = [30] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
