Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {2, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 5, 6, 9)>
