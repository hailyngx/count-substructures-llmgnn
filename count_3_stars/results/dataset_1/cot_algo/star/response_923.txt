Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 2, 6

Next, we need to identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, which we'll represent as [4]. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
