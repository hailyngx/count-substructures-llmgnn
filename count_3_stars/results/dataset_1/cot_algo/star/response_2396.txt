Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 2: {8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, and <9, (2, 5, 7)>.
