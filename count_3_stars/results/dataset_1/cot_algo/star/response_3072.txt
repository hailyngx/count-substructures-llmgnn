Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
    0
   /|\
  4 3 5
     | 
     2
    /|\
   8 7 6
      | 
      9
```

Now, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 7}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 4, 5)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 7, 8)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 6, 9)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 8, 9)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4, which is represented as [4].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>.
