Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1}

Nodes 0, 4, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 20 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>.
