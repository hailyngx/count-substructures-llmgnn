Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 8

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms star(s) with nodes 2, 3, 4: 1 [ <1, (2, 3, 4)> ]
- Node 6 forms star(s) with nodes 2, 3, 5: 1 [ <6, (2, 3, 5)> ]

The total number of 3-stars is [2].
