Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 4 have 3 neighbors. So, they will each form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it will form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

This gives a total of 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (4, 2, 9)>
- <6, (4, 6, 9)>
