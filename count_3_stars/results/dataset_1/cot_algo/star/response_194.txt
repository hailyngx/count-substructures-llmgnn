Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 5
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2 neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 4
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 6 neighbors: 4, 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 4, 8.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, 8.

Therefore, there are 2 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 4, 8)> and <4, (3, 5, 8)>.
