Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 2, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- No other nodes have 3 or more neighbors, so we do not have any additional 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 10 + 10] = 30
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (3, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>
