Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 1 has neighbors: 0
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 6, 9
Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 8
Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 4, 8
Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
Node 7 has neighbors: 6, 8
Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 3

Nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 all have 5 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them. 

For Node 0:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
For Node 2:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
For Node 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
For Node 6:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
For Node 8:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Total 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, there are 54 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)> 

So, the final answer is [54].
