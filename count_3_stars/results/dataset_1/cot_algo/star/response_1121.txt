Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: neighbors {6}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {3}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {3}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 3}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {7}
- Node 9: neighbors {7}

Next, we identify the 3-stars in the graph:
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
