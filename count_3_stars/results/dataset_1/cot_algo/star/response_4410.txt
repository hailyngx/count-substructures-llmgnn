Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 5
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 7
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 9, 1
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 1, 2
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 0
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 3
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 2, 9
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, 8
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 9, 1
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 8, 2

Total number of 3-stars: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 9, 1)>, <9, (4, 8, 2)>
