Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we get a total of 17 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is: [17] with unique 3-stars <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>.
