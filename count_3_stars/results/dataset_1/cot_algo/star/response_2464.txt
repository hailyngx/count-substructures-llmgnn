Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 3, 5, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 4
- Node 6: Neighbor is 7
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 4
- Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 3

Now, let's identify the 3-star formations:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, 8. <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7, 8. <4, (5, 7, 8)>

There are a total of 2 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [2].
