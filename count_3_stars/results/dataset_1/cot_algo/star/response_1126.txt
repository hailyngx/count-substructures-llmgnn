Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 0
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>
