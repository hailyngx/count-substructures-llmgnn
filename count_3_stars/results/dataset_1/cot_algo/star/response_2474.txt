Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 9: 7

Now, for each node with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
