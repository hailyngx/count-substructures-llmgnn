Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-star structures: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star structure: <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star structures since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star structures since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star structure: <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1] = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6.
