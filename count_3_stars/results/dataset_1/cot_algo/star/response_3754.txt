Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 3 and 5
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 3, 8, and 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 5, and 6
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 1, 8, and 9
- Node 4: Neighbor is 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 2, 7, and 8
- Node 6: Neighbor is 2
- Node 7: Neighbors are 4, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 3, 5, and 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 3, and 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 8 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 3 and Node 7 also have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 3-stars each.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars found are:
1. <1, (2, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (3, 8, 9)>
3. <8, (1, 3, 7)>
4. <8, (1, 5, 7)>
