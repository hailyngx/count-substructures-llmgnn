Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 4, 5, 7

We see that nodes 0 and 9 both have 5 neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars containing each of these nodes.

For Node 0:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For Node 9:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 = 11 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
