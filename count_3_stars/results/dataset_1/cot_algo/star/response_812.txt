Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: It has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. 
  3-stars: <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 1)>, <0, (6, 7, 3)>
  
- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. 
  3-stars: <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 0)>, <1, (6, 8, 4)>
  
- Node 4: It has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
  3-stars: <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 5)>, <4, (1, 8, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 9, 5)>, <4, (3, 9, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 1)>, <4, (5, 8, 6)>, <4, (6, 8, 1)>, <4, (6, 8, 5)>, <4, (6, 9, 3)>, <4, (6, 9, 5)>, <4, (8, 9, 3)>, <4, (8, 9, 5)>, <4, (8, 9, 6)>, <4, (9, 5, 3)>, <4, (9, 6, 3)>

- Node 6: It has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
  3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 0)>, <6, (1, 7, 4)>, <6, (4, 7, 0)>, <6, (4, 7, 1)>, <6, (4, 9, 7)>, <6, (7, 0, 1)>, <6, (7, 1, 4)>
  
- Node 7: It has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
  3-stars: <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 9, 0)>, <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <7, (6, 9, 0)>, <7, (6, 9, 5)>, <7, (8, 5, 9)>, <7, (8, 6, 9)>, <7, (9, 0, 5)>

- Node 8: It has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. 
  3-stars: <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 1)>

- Node 9: It has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

There are a total of 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [52].
