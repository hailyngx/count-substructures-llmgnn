Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 5)
- Node 1: 1 neighbor (Node 7)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (Nodes 4, 5, 8)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (Nodes 3, 6, 6)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (Nodes 0, 3, 7, 7)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (Nodes 4, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (Nodes 1, 5, 6, 5)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (Nodes 3, 6, 9)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (Nodes 6, 8)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 5: <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 6: <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 5, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
