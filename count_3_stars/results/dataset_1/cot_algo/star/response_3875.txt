Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 8
- Node 2: 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 7

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph based on the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  - <6, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <6, (4, 5, 7)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  - <7, (0, 2, 9)>
  - <7, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <7, (6, 9, 0)>
  - <7, (6, 9, 2)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  - <9, (0, 2, 7)>
  - <9, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <9, (4, 7, 0)>
  - <9, (4, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 15. 
Thus, the final answer is [15].
