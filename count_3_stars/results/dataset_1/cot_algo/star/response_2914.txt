Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbor {6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5}

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [34]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
