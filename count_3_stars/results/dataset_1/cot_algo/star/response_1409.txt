Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-star formations:
- Node 0: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: <3, (1, 8, 5)>
- Node 4: <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 5: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 9: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (1, 8, 5)> and <8, (0, 4, 9)>.
