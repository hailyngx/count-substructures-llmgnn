Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 25 \)

So, the final answer is [25] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
