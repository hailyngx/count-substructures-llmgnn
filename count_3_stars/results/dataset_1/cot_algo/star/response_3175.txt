Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 1 + 4] = 25 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 8, 9)>
