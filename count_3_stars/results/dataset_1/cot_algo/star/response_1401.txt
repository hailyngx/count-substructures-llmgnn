Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can analyze the 3-star structures within it.

- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 6
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 5
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 5
- Node 9 has neighbors: 4

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10

Listing unique 3-stars:
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
