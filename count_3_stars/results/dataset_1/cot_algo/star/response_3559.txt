Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

For each node, let's list its neighbors:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 8

We observe that the nodes 2, 3, and 5 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4C3 = 4 unique 3-stars each. Hence, 3 * 4 = 12 unique 3-stars are formed by nodes 2, 3, and 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>.
