Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1}

Now, let's identify the 3-star patterns:

- Node 0: Does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 3: Does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: Does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star: <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star: <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: Does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: Does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars formed: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
