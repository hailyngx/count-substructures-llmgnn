Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we'll first identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 7}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, we need to check for nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3-stars: <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 7, 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
