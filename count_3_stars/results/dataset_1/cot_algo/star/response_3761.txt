Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {7, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 6}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [10] \]

Therefore, the 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 9, 0)>, <5, (9, 0, 3)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 2)>, <9, (6, 2, 3)>
