Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 8 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 6 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: 4, 6 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9 (6 neighbors)
- Node 9: 8 (1 neighbor)

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 can form 3-stars because they have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8: \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 40 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 40, which we will represent as [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
