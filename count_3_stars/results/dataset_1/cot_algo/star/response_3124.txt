Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {2, 6, 7, 8}  
Node 1: {4, 6, 7}  
Node 2: {0, 6, 8, 9}  
Node 3: {7}  
Node 4: {1, 8, 9}  
Node 5: {6, 8}  
Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}  
Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 9}  
Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}  
Node 9: {2, 4, 7, 8}  

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 8 have 4 or more neighbors which means they can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 20 = 28

So, there are a total of 28 3-stars in this graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (2, 6, 8)>  
<2, (0, 6, 8)>  
<8, (0, 2, 4)>  
<8, (0, 2, 5)>  
<8, (0, 2, 6)>  
<8, (0, 2, 9)>  
<8, (4, 5, 6)>  
<8, (4, 6, 9)>  
<8, (5, 6, 9)>  
<9, (2, 4, 7)>  
<9, (2, 4, 8)>  
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
