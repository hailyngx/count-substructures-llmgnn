Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars for this graph is [18]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
