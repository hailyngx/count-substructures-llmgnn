Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 8}

Next, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 20

So, the final answer is [20].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
