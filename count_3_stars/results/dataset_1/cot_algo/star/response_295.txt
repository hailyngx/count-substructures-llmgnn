Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 8 (Degree = 4)
- Node 1: 5, 7, 9 (Degree = 3)
- Node 2: 0, 4, 9 (Degree = 3)
- Node 3: 5 (Degree = 1)
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 9 (Degree = 4)
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3 (Degree = 3)
- Node 6: 4 (Degree = 1)
- Node 7: 1 (Degree = 1)
- Node 8: 0 (Degree = 1)
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4 (Degree = 3)

Next, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it also forms 4 3-stars.
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 4] = 8 \).

Therefore, the final result is:
\[ [8] \]
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>
