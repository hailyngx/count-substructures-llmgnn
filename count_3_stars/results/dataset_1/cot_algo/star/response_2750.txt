Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 0, 3, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 6, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 1 = 31

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
