Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {0, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for this node.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for this node.

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars:

- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
