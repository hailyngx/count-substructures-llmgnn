Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1}
Node 1: {0, 7}
Node 2: {4, 8}
Node 3: {4}
Node 4: {2, 3, 8}
Node 5: {9}
Node 7: {1, 9}
Node 8: {2, 4}
Node 9: {5, 7}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (only 2 neighbors)
Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (only 2 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (only 2 neighbors)
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (only 2 neighbors)
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (only 2 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found in this graph is <4, (2, 3, 8)>.
