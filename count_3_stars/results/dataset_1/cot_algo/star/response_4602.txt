Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 6, 7}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and thus have the potential to form 3-stars.

- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 8 each have 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- For node 3: Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( [5 \times 10 + 1] = [51] \)

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
