Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 5, 7

Now, for nodes 7 and 6 which have 5 and 3 neighbors respectively, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 = 11.

Therefore, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars are <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 7)>, <7, (8, 9, 3)>.
