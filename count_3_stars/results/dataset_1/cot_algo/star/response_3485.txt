Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 7}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

There are a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
