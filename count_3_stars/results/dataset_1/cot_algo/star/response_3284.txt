Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: 1, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 3-stars: [10]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 2)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>
