Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <9, (4, 5, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
