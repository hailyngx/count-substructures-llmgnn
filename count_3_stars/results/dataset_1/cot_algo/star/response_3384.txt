Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4
- Node 1: 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 1, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 9
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, 8

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
