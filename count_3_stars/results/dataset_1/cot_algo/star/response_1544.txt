Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's identify which nodes can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, 1, 4, and 7 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
4 (3-stars from node 0) + 4 (3-stars from node 1) + 4 (3-stars from node 4) + 4 (3-stars from node 7) = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
