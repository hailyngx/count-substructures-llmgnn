Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 7
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 20 = 34 3-stars. 

So the final answer is [34] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>.
