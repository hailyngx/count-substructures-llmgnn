Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 8, and Node 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 23

So, the final answer is [23] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (6, 5, 7)>, <2, (6, 5, 8)>, <2, (7, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 2)>, <9, (1, 8, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (8, 2, 5)>
