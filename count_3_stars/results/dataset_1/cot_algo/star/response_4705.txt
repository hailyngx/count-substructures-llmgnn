Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 9: 1

Now, we need to find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: It has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 1: It has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 2: It has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 3: It has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 5: It has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 6: It has 3 neighbors (<0, 2, 3>), so 1 3-star.
- Node 7: It has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 9: It has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.

Therefore, there is 1 3-star in this graph. The unique 3-star found is <6, (0, 2, 3)>. So, the total number of 3-stars is [1].
