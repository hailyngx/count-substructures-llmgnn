Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 5, 6, 7  
Node 1: 6, 9  
Node 2: 3, 8, 9  
Node 3: 2, 5, 8  
Node 4: 5, 6, 7  
Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7  
Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7  
Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9  
Node 8: 2, 3, 9  
Node 9: 1, 2, 7, 8  

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [39].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>  
<2, (3, 8, 9)>  
<3, (2, 5, 8)>  
<4, (5, 6, 7)>  
<5, (0, 3, 4)>  
<6, (0, 1, 4)>  
<7, (0, 4, 9)>  
<8, (2, 3, 9)>  
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
