Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 5
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 7
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 6
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, 9
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>.
