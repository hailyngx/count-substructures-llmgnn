Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor nodes {2, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes {0, 1, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes {7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes {9}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes {6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes {1, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes {0, 3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 1 + 10 + 10] = [25] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <1, (8, 9, 4)>
- <1, (8, 9, 5)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (1, 9, 4)>
- <8, (1, 9, 5)>
- <8, (2, 1, 9)>
- <8, (2, 9, 4)>
- <8, (2, 9, 5)>
- <8, (6, 1, 9)>
- <8, (6, 9, 4)>
- <8, (6, 9, 5)>
- <8, (9, 1, 4)>
- <8, (9, 1, 5)>
- <8, (9, 2, 4)>
- <8, (9, 2, 5)>
- <8, (9, 6, 4)>
- <8, (9, 6, 5)>
- <9, (1, 8, 4)>
- <9, (1, 8, 5)>
- <9, (2, 8, 4)>
- <9, (2, 8, 5)>
