Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Add them up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 39

Therefore, there are 39 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
