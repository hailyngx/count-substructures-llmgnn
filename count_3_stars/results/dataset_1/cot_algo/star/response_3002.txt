Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {6, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 = 18

Therefore, the final answer is [18], and the unique 3-stars are <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, and <8, (3, 4, 7)>.
