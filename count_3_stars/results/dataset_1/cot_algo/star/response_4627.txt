Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>

Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>

Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 8, 7)>
- <4, (6, 8, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 8, 7)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 8, 3)>
- <6, (2, 8, 3)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 8, 3)>

Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 6, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 6, 5)>
- <8, (4, 6, 5)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (0, 6, 5)>

Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 48.
  
The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
