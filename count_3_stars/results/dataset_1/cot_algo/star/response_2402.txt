Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 3, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Since it has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6), it forms a 3-star <0, (2, 5, 6)>.
- Node 2: Since it has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 9), it forms 4 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>.
- Node 3: Since it has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8), it forms a 3-star <3, (1, 2, 8)>.
- Node 5: Since it has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 7), it forms a 3-star <5, (0, 1, 7)>.
- Node 6: Since it has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 7), it forms a 3-star <6, (0, 2, 7)>.
- Node 7: Since it has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 8), it forms a 3-star <7, (5, 6, 8)>.
- Node 8: Since it has 3 neighbors (3, 7, 9), it forms a 3-star <8, (3, 7, 9)>.
- Node 9: Since it has 2 neighbors (2, 8), it does not form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>.
