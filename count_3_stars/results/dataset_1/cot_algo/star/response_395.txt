Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 7

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 7 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [20 + 20 + 10 = 50], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>.
