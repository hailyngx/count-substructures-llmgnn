Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 3, 4)>, <0, (6, 4, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>.
