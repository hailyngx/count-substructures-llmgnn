Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6

We can see that nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of them:
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
