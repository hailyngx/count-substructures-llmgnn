Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2, with neighbors 3, 4, and 5
- Node 4, with neighbors 0, 1, and 2
- Node 5, with neighbors 0, 2, and 3
- Node 7, with neighbors 5, 8, and 9

There are 4 possible 3-stars, so the final result is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>.
