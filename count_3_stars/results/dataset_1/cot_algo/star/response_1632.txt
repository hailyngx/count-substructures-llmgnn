Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6
Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 3, 7
Node 5: 0, 1
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3
Node 7: 2, 3, 4
Node 8: 0, 2, 3
Node 9: 0, 2

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: 1 3-star (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: 1 3-star (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 22

Hence, the final count of 3-stars is [22].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
