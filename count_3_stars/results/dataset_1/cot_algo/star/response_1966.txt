Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 6: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}

Next, we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors (degree of 3 or more) and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:
- Node 0 and Node 1 both have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 and Node 9 both have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>
