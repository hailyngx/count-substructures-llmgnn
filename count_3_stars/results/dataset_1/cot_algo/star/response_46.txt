Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8}

Now we can identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)> 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
