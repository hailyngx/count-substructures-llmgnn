Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0

Now, we will identify the 3-star configurations:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>
