Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 19 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
