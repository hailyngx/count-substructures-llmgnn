Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
   1 -- 0
   |    |
   5 -- 6 -- 2
       |    |
       8 -- 7
           |
           9
```

Now, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 5: {0, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

We can see that nodes 0, 5, 6, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes.

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2, and they are <6, (2, 5, 8)> and <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
Putting the final number inside brackets gives us [2].
