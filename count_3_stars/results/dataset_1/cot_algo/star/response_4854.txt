Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Next, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 5
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 2, 3
- Node with 5 neighbors: 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 9) = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
