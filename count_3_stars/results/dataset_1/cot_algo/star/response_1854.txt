Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we first need to determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {6, 8}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 8 forms two 3-stars: <8, (1, 3, 7)> and <8, (1, 3, 9)>

Combining all the unique 3-stars, we have: [4] <4, (0, 3, 6)> <6, (1, 4, 5)> <8, (1, 3, 7)> <8, (1, 3, 9)>
