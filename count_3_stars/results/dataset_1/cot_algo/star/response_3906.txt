Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 8}

Node 0, Node 1, and Node 5 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them.
Calculating \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) for Node 0, we get 1 3-star.
Calculating \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) for Node 1, we get 1 3-star.
Calculating \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) for Node 5, we get 10 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( [1 + 1 + 10] = [12] \)

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
