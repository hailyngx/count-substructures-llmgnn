Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 16, and they are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>
