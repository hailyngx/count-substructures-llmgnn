Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 2, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding the 3-stars from nodes 1 and 7, we get a total of 8 3-stars. So, the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <7, (1, 2, 9)>
