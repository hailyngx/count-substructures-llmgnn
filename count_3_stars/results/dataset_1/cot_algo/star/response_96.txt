Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 7
- Nodes with 4 or more neighbors: 4

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
