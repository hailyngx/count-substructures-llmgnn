Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 2, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 3: 6 (1 neighbor)
- Node 4: 2, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0, 2, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 7, 8 (2 neighbors)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 5, 6) <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 1, 7) <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 4, 6) and (1, 7, 9) <5, (0, 4, 6)> and <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 2, 9) <7, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
