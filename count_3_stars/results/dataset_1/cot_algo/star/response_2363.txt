Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {5, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 1: Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 3: Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 6: Since it has 5 neighbors, the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \):
    - <6, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <6, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <6, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <6, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <6, (3, 4, 5)>
    - <6, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <6, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <6, (5, 8, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars is 13, so the final answer is [13].
