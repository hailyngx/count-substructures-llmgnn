Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final result is [6] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>
