Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {2, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4}
- Node 8: {6}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 0

Therefore, the final answer is [0] since there are no 3-stars in this graph.
