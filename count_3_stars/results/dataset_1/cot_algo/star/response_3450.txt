Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 7}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 16, so the final count is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (3, 7, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 7, 7)>
