Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 4: {2, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 8}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 7, and 8 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 2, 3, and 6 have 3 neighbors each.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- For nodes 0, 1, 7, and 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes 2, 3, and 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Summing up, we have a total of \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [43] \) 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <2, 3, 6>
