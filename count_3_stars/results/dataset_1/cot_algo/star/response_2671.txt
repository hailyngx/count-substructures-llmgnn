Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 1 = 15 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
