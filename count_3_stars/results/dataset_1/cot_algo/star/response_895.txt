Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0 and Node 8 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form 1 3-star each.
- No other node has 3 or more neighbors, so no other 3-stars can be formed.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 8)> and <8, (0, 2, 3)>.
