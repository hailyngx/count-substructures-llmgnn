Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>.
