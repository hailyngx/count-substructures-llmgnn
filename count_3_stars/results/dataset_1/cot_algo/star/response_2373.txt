Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
Node 1: {6, 8}
Node 2: {0, 3, 8}
Node 3: {0, 2, 7, 9}
Node 4: {6, 9}
Node 5: {6, 7}
Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 5}
Node 7: {3, 5}
Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 9}
Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [26] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
