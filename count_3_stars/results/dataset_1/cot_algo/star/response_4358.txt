Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's check for each node if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star (2, 8, 9)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star (4, 5, 9)
- Node 5 forms three 3-stars: (1, 5, 8), (2, 5, 8), and (4, 5, 9)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star (1, 5, 9)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [1 + 1 + 3 + 1] = [6].

So, the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, 8, 9>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <1, 5, 9>
