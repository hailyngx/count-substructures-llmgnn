Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  - <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
  - <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  - <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
  - <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
  - <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
  - <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10] = 30.
Therefore, the final answer is [30].
