Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 1, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: Inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: Inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: Inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: Inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: Inom{4}{3} = 4

The total number of 3-stars is [10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 26.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (3, 4, 5)>
