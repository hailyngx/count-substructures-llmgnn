Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Yes, with 5 choose 3 = 10 possibilities
- Node 1: No, less than 3 neighbors
- Node 2: No, less than 3 neighbors
- Node 3: Yes, with 3 choose 3 = 1 possibility
- Node 4: Yes, with 5 choose 3 = 10 possibilities
- Node 5: No, less than 3 neighbors
- Node 6: No, less than 3 neighbors
- Node 8: Yes, with 3 choose 3 = 1 possibility
- Node 9: Yes, with 5 choose 3 = 10 possibilities

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10] = 32. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <0, (8, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (8, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
