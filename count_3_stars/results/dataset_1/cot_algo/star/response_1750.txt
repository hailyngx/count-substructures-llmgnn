Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 6, 9}
- Node 4: neighbor {5}
- Node 5: neighbor {4}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 1, 2}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6}

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [22].
