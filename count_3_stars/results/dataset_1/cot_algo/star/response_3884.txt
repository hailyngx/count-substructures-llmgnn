Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 3, 8
Node 2: 5, 6
Node 3: 0, 1, 7, 9
Node 5: 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 6: 2, 5, 7
Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 9
Node 8: 1, 5
Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 7

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if any 3-star graph can be formed:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 21, so the answer is [21].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
