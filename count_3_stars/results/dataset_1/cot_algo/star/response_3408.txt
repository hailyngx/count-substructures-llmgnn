Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 7}
- Node 9: {4}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 39 \)

So, inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (7, 8, 9)>
