Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {4, 8}
Node 1: {3, 5}
Node 3: {1}
Node 4: {0, 9}
Node 5: {1, 8}
Node 6: {7, 8}
Node 7: {6, 9}
Node 8: {0, 5, 6, 9}
Node 9: {4, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 8 and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 3-stars each.
Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, and Node 5 have 2 neighbors each, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [2 * 4 + 2 * 4] = [16]

Unique 3-stars:
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 6)>
<9, (8, 6, 4)>
<9, (7, 8, 4)>
