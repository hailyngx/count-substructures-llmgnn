Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2 and 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 4, and 5
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 6, and 7
- Node 4: Neighbor is 2
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 2, and 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1 and 3
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 3, and 5
- Node 8: Neighbor is 0
- Node 9: Neighbor is 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1, having 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
The 3-stars involving node 1 are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 5)>, <1, (3, 6, 5)>, <1, (6, 7, 5)>, <1, (4, 7, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
