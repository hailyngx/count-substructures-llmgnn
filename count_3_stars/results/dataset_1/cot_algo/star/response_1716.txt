Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 5, 6
Node 1: 5, 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 4, 7, 8
Node 3: 7, 8
Node 4: 2, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 9
Node 6: 0, 5, 7
Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, and 8
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 7, 8, and 9
Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, and 6
Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, and 9
Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, and 9
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, and 8

There are a total of 6 3-stars found, so the final answer is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>
