Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes {5}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes {4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes {4, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes {4, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes {1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes {0, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes {8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes {1, 7}

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- For Node 1:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- For Node 2:  \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star
- For Node 3:  \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star
- For Node 4:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- For Node 5:  \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-star
- For Node 7:  \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star
- For Node 8:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- For Node 9:  \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star

Thus, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, and the 10 3-stars involving Node 8 as listed above.
