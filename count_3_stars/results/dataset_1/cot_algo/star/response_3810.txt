Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors = {2, 6, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors = {3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors = {0, 4, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors = {1, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors = {2, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors = {1, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors = {0, 4, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors = {0, 1}
- Node 8: neighbors = {3}
- Node 9: neighbors = {2}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {2, 6, 7}: <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star with them: <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {0, 4, 9}: <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {0, 4, 5}: <6, (0, 4, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars is 4, so the final answer is [4].
