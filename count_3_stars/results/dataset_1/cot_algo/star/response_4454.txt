Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7 have 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7 will each contribute \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 will contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [8] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
