Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5, 7, 8
Node 1: 2, 3, 7, 8
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
Node 4: 2, 5, 8
Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 6: 3, 5, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 8: 0, 1, 4
Node 9: 2, 5, 6, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 2 can form a 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 9)>
Node 3 can form a 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 7)>
Node 5 can form two 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 6)> and <5, (3, 7, 9)>
Node 7 can form a 3-star: <7, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
