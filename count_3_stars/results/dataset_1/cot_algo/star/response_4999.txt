Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's write down the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, 5, and 9 have 4 neighbors each.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [22] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
