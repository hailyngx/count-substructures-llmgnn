Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 4: No 3-star
- Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28, which can be represented as [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
