Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 4, 7

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

So, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>.
