Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3, and 9 each have 4 or more neighbors.
- Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each, we have:
  - Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
  - Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
  - Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 1] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
