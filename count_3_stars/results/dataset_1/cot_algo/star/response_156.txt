Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 7  
Node 1: 0, 8  
Node 2: 6  
Node 3: 0, 4, 8, 9  
Node 4: 0, 3, 5  
Node 5: 4, 6  
Node 6: 2, 5  
Node 7: 0  
Node 8: 1, 3, 9  
Node 9: 3, 8  

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

Node 0: 4 neighbors, number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: 4 neighbors, number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: 3 neighbors, number of 3-stars = 1
Node 5: 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star
Node 8: 3 neighbors, number of 3-stars = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>.
