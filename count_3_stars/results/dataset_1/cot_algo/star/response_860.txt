Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [58]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)> 
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
