Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2, 5, and 8 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 1 and 9 have 3 neighbors each.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 2, 5, and 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes 1 and 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Total number of 3-stars: 3 * 4 + 2 * 1 = 14

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14], and they are:
<2, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>
