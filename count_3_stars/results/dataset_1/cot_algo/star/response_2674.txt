Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 7}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {3, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 3}
- Node 9: {2}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4 have three or more neighbors.

Now, letâ€™s calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 1, there are no 3-stars formed.
- For Node 2, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed.
- For Node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
- For Node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1+4+4 = 9, which we will represent as [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <4, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <4, (1, 2, 4)>
- <4, (2, 3, 4)>
- <4, (3, 4, 5)>
