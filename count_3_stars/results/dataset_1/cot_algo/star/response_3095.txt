Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's examine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {0, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 4, and 5 each have 3 neighbors, so they contribute 1 3-star each.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it also contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \([1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [14]\).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (0, 7, 2)>
- <2, (6, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
