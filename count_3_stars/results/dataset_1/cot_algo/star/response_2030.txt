Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 1: 0, 6
Node 2: 3, 8
Node 3: 0, 2, 7
Node 4: 0, 6
Node 5: 6
Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 8
Node 7: 3, 9
Node 8: 2, 6, 9
Node 9: 0, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 6: 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
Node 8: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 9: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11

So, the total number of 3-stars is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
