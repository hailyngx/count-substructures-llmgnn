Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 1, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 8
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 0, 6
Node 6: 5
Node 7: 0, 2
Node 8: 0, 3, 9
Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 8

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9 all have 3 neighbors, so each can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 5] = 15 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 1)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 8, 2)>
