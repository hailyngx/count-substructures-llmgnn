Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 3, 7, and 9.

For node 3:
Neighbors: 0, 5, 8
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center} = \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<3, (0, 5, 8)>

For node 7:
Neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center} = \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
<7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>

For node 9:
Neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>

In total, there are 1 + 10 + 4 = 15 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
