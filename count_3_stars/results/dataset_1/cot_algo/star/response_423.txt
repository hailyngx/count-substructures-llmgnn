Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.

Calculating the total number of unique 3-stars:

Total = 1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 12

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, 1, 2>
- <2, 0, 1>
- <2, 0, 7>
- <2, 1, 0>
- <2, 1, 7>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <2, 7, 0>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <2, 7, 9>
- <6, 4, 8>
- <7, 0, 2>
- <7, 2, 0>
