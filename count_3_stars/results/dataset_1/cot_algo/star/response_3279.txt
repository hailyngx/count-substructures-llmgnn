Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 4

Next, we'll count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star (with nodes 1, 4)
- Node 2: 1 3-star (with nodes 5, 7)
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star (with nodes 3, 6, 8)
- Node 5: 0 3-stars
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 0 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1+1+1] = 3.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4)>
- <2, (5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
