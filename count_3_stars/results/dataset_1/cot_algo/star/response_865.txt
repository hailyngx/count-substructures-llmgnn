Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 8, 9)>
