Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 3: {7, 8}
- Node 4: {8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, form 1 3-star
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 5 neighbors, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>

<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>

<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
