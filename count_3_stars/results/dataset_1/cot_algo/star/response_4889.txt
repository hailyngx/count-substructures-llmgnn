Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 5)
- Node 1: 1 neighbor (Node 2)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (Nodes 1, 3, 5)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 5, 7)
- Node 4: 1 neighbor (Node 5)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (Nodes 7, 8)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (Nodes 3, 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (Nodes 6, 7, 9)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (Nodes 7, 8)

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 3 form a 3-star with Node 5: <2, 3, 5>
- Node 3 and Node 5 form a 3-star with Node 7: <3, 5, 7>
- Node 5 and Node 7 form a 3-star with Node 3: <5, 7, 3>

Since each of the above 3-stars is counted twice in our calculations, the total number of unique 3-stars is 3, which we put inside brackets: [3].
