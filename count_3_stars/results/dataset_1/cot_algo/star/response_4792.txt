Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 3, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 5, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors are 3, 6
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 5, 6
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: Neighbors are 3, 5
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: Neighbors are 3, 5

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
For Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
For Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] is 10. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 9)>
