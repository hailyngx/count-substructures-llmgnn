Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph:

```
    0 -- 4 -- 5 -- 7
    |         |    |
    6         8 -- 2 -- 9
               |
               3
```

Next, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 4 and 6
- Node 2: neighbors are 3, 4, 8, and 9
- Node 3: neighbor is 2
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 7, and 8
- Node 5: neighbors are 4 and 7
- Node 6: neighbor is 0
- Node 7: neighbors are 4 and 5
- Node 8: neighbors are 2 and 4
- Node 9: neighbor is 2

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: does not have 3 or more neighbors

The total number of 3-stars is 14, so we put this number inside brackets: [14].

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 5)>.
