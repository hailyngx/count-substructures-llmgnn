Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 7

Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22

Therefore, the final result is [22] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (8, 9, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, and <5, (0, 4, 9)>.
