Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 0
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 4, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 3
- Node 5 neighbors: 8, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 0
- Node 8 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 8, 9

For these nodes, we'll calculate \( \binom{3}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars formed. Since each of these nodes has exactly 3 neighbors, only 1 3-star can be formed with each of them.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 (1 for each of nodes 0, 2, 8, and 9).

Thus, the final answer is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (8, 9, 0)>
- <8, (5, 9, 6)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>
