Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

0: [1, 9]
1: [0, 6, 9]
2: [7]
3: [4, 5, 8]
4: [3, 7, 9]
5: [3, 6]
6: [1, 5, 7]
7: [2, 4, 6]
8: [3]
9: [0, 1, 4]

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 6, 9: <1, (0, 6, 9)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 5, 8: <3, (4, 5, 8)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 7, 9: <4, (3, 7, 9)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 5, 7: <6, (1, 5, 7)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 4, 6: <7, (2, 4, 6)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, 4: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we have [6].
