Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2
- Node 8: 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of 36 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<0, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<0, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (7, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 9)>, 
<2, (7, 3, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 4)>, 
<4, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<8, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<9, (0, 3, 2)>, 
<9, (0, 7, 2)>, 
<9, (1, 3, 2)>, 
<9, (1, 0, 2)>, 
<9, (1, 7, 2)>, 
<9, (3, 7, 2)>, 
<9, (3, 0, 2)>, 
<9, (3, 4, 2)>, 
<9, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<9, (8, 4, 6)>
