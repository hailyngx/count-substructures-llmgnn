Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify each node's neighbors:

Node 0: Neighbors {5}
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 6}
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
Node 6: Neighbors {1}
Node 7: Neighbors {9}
Node 8: Neighbors {2}
Node 9: Neighbors {2, 5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 1, 2, and 5 each have three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate inom{n}{3} for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 9, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
