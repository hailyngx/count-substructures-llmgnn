Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

For Node 0:
Neighbors: {1, 2, 4}
Possible 3-stars: [1]

For Node 1:
Neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 8}
Possible 3-stars: [1]

For Node 2:
Neighbors: {0, 1, 8}
Possible 3-stars: [1]

For Node 4:

Possible 3-stars: [1]

For Node 7:
Neighbors: {9}
Possible 3-stars: [0]

For Node 8:
Neighbors: {1, 2, 5, 6}
Possible 3-stars: [1]

For Node 9:
Neighbors: {7}
Possible 3-stars: [0]

Total number of 3-stars: [7]
