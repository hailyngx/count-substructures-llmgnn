Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 5
- Node 2: Neighbor is 7
- Node 3: Neighbors are 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: Neighbor is 6
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 1, 6
- Node 6: Neighbors are 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star, <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star, <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star, <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star, <7, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 can also form 1 3-star, <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
