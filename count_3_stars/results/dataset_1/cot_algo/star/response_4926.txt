Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, and Node 9 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8 have fewer than 3 neighbors and hence do not form any 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [40] \).

The unique 3-stars formed are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
