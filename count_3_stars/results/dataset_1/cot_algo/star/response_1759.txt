Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8: Forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: Does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1+4 = 5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
