Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 2
|    |
2 -- 3
|    |
1 -- 4
|    |
3 -- 5
|    |
1 -- 6
|    |
|    9 -- 7
6 -- 9 -- 8
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 6. So, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 9. So, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 6) + 10 (from node 9) = 12. So, the answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>.
