Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2}
- Node 6: {2, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (6, 4, 8)>
- <2, (7, 1, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 7, 1)>
