Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the set of neighbors for each node based on the given list of edges:
- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {5, 6, 7}. Therefore, we have 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 8, 9}. Therefore, we have 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {0, 3, 9}. Therefore, we have 1 3-star.

Putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets, we get: [3].
Listing the unique 3-stars found, we have: <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>
