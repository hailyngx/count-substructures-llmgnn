Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4

Let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 0, 8
- Node 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 6
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 5
- Node 7 neighbors: 2
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 2, 4
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 1, 3

Identifying the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, and 8
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, and 6
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, and 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, and <9, (0, 1, 3)>.
