Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 4

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars that can be formed: 
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 5 \]

Therefore, there are 5 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)> 

Putting the final number inside brackets, we get: [5].
