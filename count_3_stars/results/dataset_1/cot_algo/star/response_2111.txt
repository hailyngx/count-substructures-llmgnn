Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 7
Node 3: 0, 8
Node 4: 1, 5
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 7, 8
Node 7: 2, 6, 9
Node 8: 3, 6
Node 9: 7

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1], and the unique 3-stars found are <7, (2, 6, 9)>.
