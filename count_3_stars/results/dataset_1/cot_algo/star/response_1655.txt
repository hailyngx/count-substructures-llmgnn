Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 7}
Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 9}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 8, 9}
Node 6: Neighbor {9}
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}
Node 8: Neighbor {5}
Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5, 6}

Now, let's look at the nodes with three or more neighbors to identify the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7, 9

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
