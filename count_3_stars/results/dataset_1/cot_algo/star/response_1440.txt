Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 8
Node 1: 3, 5, 6
Node 2: 4, 8
Node 3: 1, 4
Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 9
Node 7: 6, 8
Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 7
Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars based on having at least 3 neighbors:
Nodes that can form 3-stars: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8

For each of these nodes with at least 3 neighbors, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they can form. Let's start with node 1:
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
<4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>

Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
<5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
<6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
<8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>

Counting all the 3-stars formed, we have:
\[ [1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [23] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>
