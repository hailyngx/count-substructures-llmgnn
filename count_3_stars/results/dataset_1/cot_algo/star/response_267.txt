Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:  
Node 0: {4, 6, 7}  
Node 1: {2, 4, 7}  
Node 2: {1, 9}  
Node 3: {4}  
Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 9}  
Node 6: {0, 4, 7}  
Node 7: {0, 1, 6}  
Node 9: {2, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  

Total number of 3-stars: [14]  
Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 1)>, <6, (0, 7, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>
