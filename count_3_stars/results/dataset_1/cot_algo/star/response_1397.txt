Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Therefore, there is 1 3-star in this graph, resulting in the final answer being [1]. 
The unique 3-star found is <7, (0, 1, 8)>.
