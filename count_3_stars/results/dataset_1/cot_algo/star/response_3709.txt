Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: 4

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22, so the total number of 3-stars is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
