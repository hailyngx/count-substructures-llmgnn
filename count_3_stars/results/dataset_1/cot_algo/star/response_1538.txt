Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: 1 possible 3-star
- Node 4: 1 possible 3-star
- Node 6: 4 possible 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 1)>
