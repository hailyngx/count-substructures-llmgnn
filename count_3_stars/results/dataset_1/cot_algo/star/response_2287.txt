Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Nodes 0, 2, 6, 8, and 9 have 5 or more neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( [10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20] = 64 \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
