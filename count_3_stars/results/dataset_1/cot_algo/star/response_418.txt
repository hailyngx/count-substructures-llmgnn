Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. The neighbor set for each node is as follows:

- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: Does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: Forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: Forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: Forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: Forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: Forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8: Forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 33 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
