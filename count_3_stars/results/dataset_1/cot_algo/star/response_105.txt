Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 6

Next, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 6, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
