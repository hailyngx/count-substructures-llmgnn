Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {7}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 
\[ [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [16] \]

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>
