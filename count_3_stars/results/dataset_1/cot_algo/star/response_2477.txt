Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star structures:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars formed = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [17], and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>
