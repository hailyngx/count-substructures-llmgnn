Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: 3, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14, so the final number inside brackets is [14].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
