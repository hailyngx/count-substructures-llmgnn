Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the neighbors for each node are as follows:  
\( \text{Node 0} \rightarrow \{ 2, 8, 9 \} \)  
\( \text{Node 1} \rightarrow \{ 3, 8 \} \)  
\( \text{Node 2} \rightarrow \{ 0 \} \)  
\( \text{Node 3} \rightarrow \{ 1, 5, 8 \} \)  
\( \text{Node 4} \rightarrow \{ 8 \} \)  
\( \text{Node 5} \rightarrow \{ 3 \} \)  
\( \text{Node 7} \rightarrow \{ 9 \} \)  
\( \text{Node 8} \rightarrow \{ 0, 1, 3, 4 \} \)  
\( \text{Node 9} \rightarrow \{ 0, 7 \} \)  

Now we will check each node to see if a 3-star is formed:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors and doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars formed: \( [1 + 1 + 4] = 6 \)  
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>
