Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star structures
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-star structures
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star structures
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star structure

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 20 + 10 + 1] = [41] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
