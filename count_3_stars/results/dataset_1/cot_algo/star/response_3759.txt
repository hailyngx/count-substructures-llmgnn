Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will represent the graph in an adjacency list format to better visualize the relationships:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 2
Node 2: 1, 7, 8
Node 3: 6
Node 4: 0, 5, 9
Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 9
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 0, 2, 5
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 4, 5

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11 \), so the final result is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 4)>
<0, (7, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 4)>
<5, (4, 0, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 0)>
