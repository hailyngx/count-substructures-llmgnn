Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are: <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>.
