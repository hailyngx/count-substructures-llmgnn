Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 3}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 0 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 2: 0 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 4: 0 3-star
- Node 5: 0 3-star
- Node 6: 0 3-star
- Node 7: 0 3-star
- Node 8: 0 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 2
Therefore, the final answer is [2] with the unique 3-stars <1, (3, 6, 8)> and <3, (0, 1, 2)>.
