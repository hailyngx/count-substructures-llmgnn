Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( {{3} \choose {3}} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 1: \( {{3} \choose {3}} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 4: \( {{6} \choose {3}} = 20 \) (20 3-stars)
- Node 8: \( {{3} \choose {3}} = 1 \) (1 3-star)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 20 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 8) = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>

These are the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
