Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These are: <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6, so the final answer is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<1, (0, 2, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<1, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
