Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes are 8.
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes are 4, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes are 9.
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes are 2, 9.
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes are 2.
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes are 2, 9.
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes are 2, 9.
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes are 0.
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes are 3, 4, 6, 7.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4] = [8].

The unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>.
