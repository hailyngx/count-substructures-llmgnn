Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 2
Node 1: 0, 6
Node 2: 0, 6, 9
Node 3: 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 3
Node 7: 3, 8
Node 8: 3, 7
Node 9: 2, 3

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 6, 9)>
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: 
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
