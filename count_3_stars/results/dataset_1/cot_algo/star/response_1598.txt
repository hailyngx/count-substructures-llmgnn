Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 6, 1) <0, (1, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 2, 4) <1, (2, 4)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes (8, 9, 2) <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 5, 9) <4, (5, 8, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars is 4, so the answer is [4].
