Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 6, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 4, 8
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 4, 6
- Node 4: Neighbors are 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>

So, there are a total of 14 3-stars in the graph. This number goes inside brackets [] as [14].
