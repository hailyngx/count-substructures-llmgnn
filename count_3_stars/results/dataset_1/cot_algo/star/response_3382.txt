Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 9
- Node 1: 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (as it only has two neighbors)

So, we have a total of 2 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [2].
