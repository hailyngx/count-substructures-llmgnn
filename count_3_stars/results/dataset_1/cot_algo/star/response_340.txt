Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [30], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
