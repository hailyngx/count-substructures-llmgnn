Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we first need to find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 7, 8)  <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 7, 8) <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 5), and (4, 6, 7) 
    <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 5)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars identified in the graph is [5].
