Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: None (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: None (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: None (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
