Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 5.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 4.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 3, 8.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 5.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 3, 6.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 9.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 4, 5.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 9.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 9.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 5, 7, 8.

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, 8.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 4.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, 6.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, 6.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 7, 8, 5.

There are 5 unique 3-stars:
1. <2, (0, 3, 8)>
2. <3, (1, 2, 4)>
3. <4, (1, 3, 6)>
4. <5, (0, 3, 6)>
5. <9, (7, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
