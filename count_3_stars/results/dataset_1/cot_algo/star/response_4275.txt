Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 5

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 0, 9>
<5, 2, 6>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
