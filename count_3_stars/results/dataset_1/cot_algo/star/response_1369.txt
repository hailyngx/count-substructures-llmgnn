Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 9)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 7)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (5, 9)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 6, 8)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (0, 2)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (1, 3)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (1, 8)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (3, 7)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (0, 2)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9: <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6: <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6: <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 3, so the final answer is [3].
