Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: {6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 8}

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star (1, 6, 7).
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star (1, 6, 8).
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star (3, 4, 8).
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star (3, 6, 9).
- Node 5 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star (1, 2, 6).
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star (1, 6, 8).
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star.

Adding all the 3-stars found, we have a total of 5 3-stars in the graph.
So, the final answer is [5] and the unique 3-stars are <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, and <1, 2, 6>.
