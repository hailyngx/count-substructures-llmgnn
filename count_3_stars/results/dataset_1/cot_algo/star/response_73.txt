Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 8

Next, we need to check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 7, and Node 8 each have 3 neighbors
  - Number of 3-stars for Node 0 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
  - Number of 3-stars for Node 7 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
  - Number of 3-stars for Node 8 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 \). 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 6)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (7, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 9, 4)>
- <8, (3, 9, 5)>
- <8, (7, 9, 0)>
- <8, (7, 9, 4)>
