Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>

There are no other nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars is 5:

[5]
Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
