Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 38 3-stars. 

Thus, the final answer is [38] and the unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>
