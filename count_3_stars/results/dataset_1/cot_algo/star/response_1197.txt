Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5
Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 2: 4, 5, 9
Node 3: 1, 6, 9
Node 4: 2, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 9
Node 6: 1, 3, 7
Node 7: 1, 6
Node 8: 1, 4, 9
Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars. 
Since node 0 has 1 neighbor, node 7 has 2 neighbors, and nodes 1 and 6 have more than 3 neighbors, we will focus on them.

For node 1:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
So, there are 10 possible 3-stars with node 1 as the center. 

For node 6:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
So, there is 1 possible 3-star with node 6 as the center. 

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1] = 11.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
