Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 38 []

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (4, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
