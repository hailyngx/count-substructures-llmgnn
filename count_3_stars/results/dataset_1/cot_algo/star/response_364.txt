Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 1: 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 6, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars: 
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9), so it forms one 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 9), so it forms 4 3-stars: 
  - <8, (3, 5, 6)>
  - <8, (3, 5, 9)>
  - <8, (3, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8), so it forms one 3-star: <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 6. 
So, the final answer is [6].
