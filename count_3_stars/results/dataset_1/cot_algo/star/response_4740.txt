Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbor {9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbor {9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 8, 9} <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 7, 8} <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 6, 7} <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 5} <9, (0, 1, 5)> and a 3-star with neighbors {2, 7, 9} <9, (2, 7, 9)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars found.

Therefore, the final answer is [4]
