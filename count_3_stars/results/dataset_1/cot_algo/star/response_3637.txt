Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves (4, 5, 9)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves (5, 6, 8)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves (7, 6, 9)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars = 3 and putting it inside brackets []:
[3]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (7, 6, 9)>
