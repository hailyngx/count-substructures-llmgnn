Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's define the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 8} 

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 7, 8}. Unique 3-star: <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 7, 8}. Unique 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 9}. Unique 3-star: <8, (1, 6, 9)>

There are 3 unique 3-stars in total, so the final result is [3].
