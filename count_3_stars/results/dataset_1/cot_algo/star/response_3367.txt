Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graph formed based on the given edges is as follows:

Total number of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 0, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
