Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 1: Neighbors {8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (5, 6, 7)> and <5, (2, 3, 6)>.
