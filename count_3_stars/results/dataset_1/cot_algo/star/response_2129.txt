Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 (Degree: 5)
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7 (Degree: 3)
- Node 2: 0, 7 (Degree: 2)
- Node 4: 0, 5 (Degree: 2)
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7 (Degree: 3)
- Node 6: 0, 7 (Degree: 2)
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6 (Degree: 5)

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 and Node 7 have 5 neighbors each.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes 0 and 7:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 = 20.

The unique 3-stars are:

- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 2, 6)>
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [20] and the unique 3-stars are as listed above.
