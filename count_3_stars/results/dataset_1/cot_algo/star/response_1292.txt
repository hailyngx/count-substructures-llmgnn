Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find all 3-star structures in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 5
- Node 1: Neighbor is 6
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 7
- Node 3: Neighbors are 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: Neighbor is 7
- Node 5: Neighbor is 0
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 3
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 3, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in this graph:

- Node 3 forms one 3-star with neighbors 6, 7, and 9: <3, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
