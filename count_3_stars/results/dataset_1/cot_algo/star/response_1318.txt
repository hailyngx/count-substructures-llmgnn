Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 7

Next, we identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 13, which we denote as [13].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>.
