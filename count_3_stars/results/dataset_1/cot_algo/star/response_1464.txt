Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 7

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
  <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>
  
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors so it can form 1 3-star: 
  <2, (0, 4, 6)>

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
  <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
  
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
  <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>,
  <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>,
  <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 6, 4)>, <6, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 6, 7)>,
  <6, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars formed is [4 + 1 + 4 + 20] = 29.
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 6, 4)>, 
<6, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 6)>
