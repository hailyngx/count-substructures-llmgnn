Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 8}

Now, we can see that nodes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 2 forms the following 3-stars:
    - <2, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <2, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 7, 8)>
    - <2, (5, 7, 8)>

- Node 4 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars since it has only 2 neighbors.

- Node 6 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars since it has only 2 neighbors.

- Node 8 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars since it has only 2 neighbors.

- Node 9 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars since it has only 2 neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us 4. Therefore, the final result is [4] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, and <2, (5, 7, 8)>.
