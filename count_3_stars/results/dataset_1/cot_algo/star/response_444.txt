Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 7
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 2: 1, 5
Node 3: 0, 1, 7
Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 9
Node 6: 1, 5, 7
Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 6
Node 8: 9
Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7, 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Adding these up: \(1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 20\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>.
