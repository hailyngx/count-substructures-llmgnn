Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node. Then we will identify the 3-stars formed by nodes with at least 3 neighbors.

- Node 0: Neighbors: 3
- Node 1: Neighbors: 7, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors: 0, 6, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors: 5, 7
- Node 5: Neighbors: 4, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors: 2, 3, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 7, and 9: <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 6, and 9: <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 8, and 9: <6, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
