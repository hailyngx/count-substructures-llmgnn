Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 2, 6, 9
- Node 1: neighbors are 2, 5
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: neighbors are 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: neighbors are 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 3, 7
- Node 9: neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node with 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing them up, we have a total of 23 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 7)>
