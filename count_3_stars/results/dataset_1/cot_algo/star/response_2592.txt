Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: inom(6, 3) = 20
- Node 1: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 2: not eligible
- Node 4: not eligible
- Node 5: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 7: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 8: inom(5, 3) = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the result is [42] and the unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>.
