Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 44 edges, we will first find the neighbors of each node.

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars.

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding all these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 62

Therefore, there are a total of [62] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 3)>, <8, (5, 9, 3)>, <8, (6, 9, 3)>
