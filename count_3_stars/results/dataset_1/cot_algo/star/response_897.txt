Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with edges {(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6)}
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with edges {(1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 9)}
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with edges {(7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 9)}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with edges {(9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 7)}

There are 4 unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is [4].
