Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are:
- Node 0: {1}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6}

Node 1, 3, 6, and 9 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{7}{3} = 35
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 1 + 35 + 1] = 47

Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (5, 3, 7)>, <6, (5, 4, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 9, 7)>, <6, (7, 9, 1)>, <6, (9, 4, 1)>, <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <6, (9, 3, 5)>, <6, (9, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 1)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 3)>, <9, (1, 6, 5)>
