Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 5, 8

Next, for each node with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 1: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 3: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 4: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 5: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 8: [\( \binom{2}{3} \)] = 0
- Node 9: [\( \binom{2}{3} \)] = 0

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0] = [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
