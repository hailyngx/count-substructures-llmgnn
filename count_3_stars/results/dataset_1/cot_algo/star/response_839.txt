Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 and Node 9 have 5 neighbors each
- Node 1 and Node 2 have 4 neighbors each

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0 and Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
- For Node 1 and Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each

Total 3-stars: \( [10 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [28] \)

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
