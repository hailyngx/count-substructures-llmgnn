Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 7}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: 1 3-star formed with neighbors {3, 5, 7} => <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 1: 1 3-star formed with neighbors {3, 5, 7} => <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 3: 1 3-star formed with neighbors {0, 1, 6} => <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 5: 1 3-star formed with neighbors {0, 1, 4} => <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 9: 1 3-star formed with neighbors {5, 7, 0} => <9, (5, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (5, 7, 0)>.
