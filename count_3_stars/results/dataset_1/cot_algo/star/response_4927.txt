Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8
- Node 7: 3, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 1, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5, 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 6, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = [10]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 7), (1, 4, 1), (2, 1, 3)>
<8, (5, 6, 9), (5, 7, 9), (5, 8, 9), (6, 5, 8)>
