Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <0, (1, 7, 2)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (2, 9, 7)>
- <0, (7, 1, 2)>
- <0, (7, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (8, 0, 2)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 0, 7)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (7, 0, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- <7, (1, 0, 2)>
- <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- <7, (2, 0, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>
