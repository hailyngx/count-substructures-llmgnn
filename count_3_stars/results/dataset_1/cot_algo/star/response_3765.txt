Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 7}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 = 6]

Unique 3-stars:
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
