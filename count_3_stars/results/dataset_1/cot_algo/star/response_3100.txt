Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 6, 9} ⇨ <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 forms three 3-stars with neighbors {6, 7, 8} ⇨ <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars with neighbors {0, 1, 4} and {7, 8, 9} ⇨ <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 3 + 2] = [6].
