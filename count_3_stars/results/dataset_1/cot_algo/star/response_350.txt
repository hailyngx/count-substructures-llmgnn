Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 6: 1, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7

Next, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 7)>
