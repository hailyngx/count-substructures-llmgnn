Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 6, and 8 have 3 neighbors.
- Node 2, 4, and 7 have 3 neighbors as well, but they are already accounted for.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 20] = 25

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 4)>
<8, (6, 1, 4)>
<8, (6, 1, 7)>
<8, (6, 4, 1)>
<8, (6, 7, 1)>
<8, (6, 7, 4)>
<8, (6, 4, 7)>
<8, (6, 1, 7)>
<8, (6, 4, 9)>
