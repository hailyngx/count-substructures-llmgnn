Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 7.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 7, 8.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 7, 8.
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars:
    - <7, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (2, 3, 9)>

Counting the 3-stars, we have a total of [5].
