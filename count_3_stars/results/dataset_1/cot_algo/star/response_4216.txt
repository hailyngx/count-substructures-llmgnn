Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 and Node 5 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 = 20 \]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>

The final answer is [20].
