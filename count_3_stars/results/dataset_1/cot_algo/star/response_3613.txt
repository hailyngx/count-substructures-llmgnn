Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 5, 8, 9
Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9
Node 3: 1, 8
Node 4: 1
Node 5: 0, 7
Node 6: 1, 2, 8
Node 7: 2, 5, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 9
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 9
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, and 2
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 2

So, we have a total of 6 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as:

[6]
<0, 2, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9, 2>
<8, 6, 7, 9>
<9, 7, 8, 2>
