Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {7}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 8}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars based on the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: There is only 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 3: There are 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: There is only 1 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 7: There is only 1 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: There is only 1 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 9: There is only 1 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>.
