Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 5, and Node 6 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 1 (from Node 2) + 4 (from Node 5) + 4 (from Node 6) = 9. 

Therefore, the final result is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (5, 9, 2)>
