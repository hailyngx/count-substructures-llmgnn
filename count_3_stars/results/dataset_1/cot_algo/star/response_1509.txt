Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 3}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it does not form any 3-stars
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it does not form any 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 15, which we denote as [15].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>.
