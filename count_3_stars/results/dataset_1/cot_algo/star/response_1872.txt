Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by listing the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: (7)
- Node 1: (6, 8, 9)
- Node 2: (5, 9)
- Node 3: (5)
- Node 4: (6, 8, 9)
- Node 5: (2, 3, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 6: (1, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 7: (0, 5)
- Node 8: (1, 4)
- Node 9: (1, 2, 4, 5, 6)

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 9

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 26, which we will put inside brackets as [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>
