Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7, 8

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star (4, 5, 6).
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: (5, 7, 9), (5, 6, 7), (5, 6, 9), (5, 7, 8).
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: (6, 7, 9), (6, 8, 9), (6, 7, 8), (6, 4, 5).
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: (7, 8, 9), (7, 5, 6), (7, 6, 8), (7, 5, 9).
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star (8, 6, 9).

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of 14 3-stars. Therefore, the final result is [14], and the unique 3-stars are <(4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 9), (5, 6, 7), (5, 6, 9), (5, 7, 8), (6, 7, 9), (6, 8, 9), (6, 7, 8), (6, 4, 5), (7, 8, 9), (7, 5, 6), (7, 6, 8), (7, 5, 9), (8, 6, 9)> .
