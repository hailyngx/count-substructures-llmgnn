Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node. Let's calculate the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 3, 4, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center
- For node 3: \( \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center
- For node 4: \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center
- For node 8: \( \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center

Adding them all up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 28

So, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
