Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2

Let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Now, let's examine each node that has three or more neighbors to count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: [42]

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
