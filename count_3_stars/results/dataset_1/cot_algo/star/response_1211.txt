Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 6, 7, 9
Node 1: 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 1, 2, 7
Node 4: 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 8
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4
Node 8: 4, 5, 6
Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: [] 
Node 1: []
Node 2: []
Node 3: []
Node 4: []
Node 5: []
Node 6: []
Node 7: []
Node 8: {<8, (4, 6, 7)>}
Node 9: []

Summing up, we have a total of [1] 3-star. The unique 3-star found is <8, (4, 6, 7)>.
