Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 0 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [0 + 10 + 1 + 0] = 11.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 3)>, <2, (1, 0, 8)>, <2, (3, 9, 7)>, <2, (5, 2, 7)>, <2, (5, 2, 8)>, <2, (7, 3, 9)>, <2, (7, 3, 2)>, <2, (9, 3, 7)>, <2, (9, 3, 2)>.

So, the final answer is [11].
