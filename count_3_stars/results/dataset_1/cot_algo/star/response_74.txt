Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3, 7, 8}
Node 1: {2, 4, 5}
Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 8}
Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}
Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 7}
Node 6: {3, 7}
Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 9}
Node 9: {8}

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
