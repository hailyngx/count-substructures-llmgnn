Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 5, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, and Node 8 have 4 neighbors each.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 1, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- For Node 2, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 6)>
- For Node 5, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 6)>
- For Node 8, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars: <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have 16 in total. 
Therefore, the final answer is [16].
