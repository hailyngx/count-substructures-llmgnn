Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 6, Node 9

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 13, and they are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 6)>, <0, (6, 3, 7)>, <0, (6, 3, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 3)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 9, 3)>, <0, (6, 9, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)> 

So, the final answer is: [13] <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 6)>, <0, (6, 3, 7)>, <0, (6, 3, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 3)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 9, 3)>, <0, (6, 9, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>
