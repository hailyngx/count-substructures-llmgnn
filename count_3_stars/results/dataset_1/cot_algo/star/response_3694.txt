Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 5
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Adding these up: \[4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 13.

The unique 3-stars are listed below:
<1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>
