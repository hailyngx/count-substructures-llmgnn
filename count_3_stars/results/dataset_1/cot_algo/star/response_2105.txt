Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbor {4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 35 + 10 + 4 = 49 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [49]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (0, 7, 6)>
- <9, (1, 7, 6)>
- <9, (1, 0, 6)>
