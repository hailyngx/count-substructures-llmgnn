Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, 9 <0, (1, 8, 9)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, 9 <4, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
