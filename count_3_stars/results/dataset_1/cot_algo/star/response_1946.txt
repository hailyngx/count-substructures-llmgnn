Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2
- Node 6: 0, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 6

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 5: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9: <1, (5, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9: <2, (1, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9: <4, (7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, 9: <7, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
