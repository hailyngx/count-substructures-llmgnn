Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs in this graph, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-star subgraphs it can form:

- Node 4: Can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star subgraphs => <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 5: Can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star subgraph => <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 7: Can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star subgraph => <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: Can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star subgraphs => <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 9: Can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star subgraph => <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star subgraphs is [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 11.

The unique 3-star subgraphs are: 
<4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 6)>, 
<7, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<9, (3, 4, 7)>.
