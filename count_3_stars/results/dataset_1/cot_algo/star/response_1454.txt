Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 6

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star (1, 2, 5)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (not enough for a 3-star)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (not enough for a 3-star)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star (6, 7, 9)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars -> (7, 1, 8), (7, 3, 8), (7, 6, 8), (7, 8, 9)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 5)>, <6, (7, 9)>, <7, (1, 8)>, <7, (3, 8)>, <7, (6, 8)>, <7, (8, 9)>
