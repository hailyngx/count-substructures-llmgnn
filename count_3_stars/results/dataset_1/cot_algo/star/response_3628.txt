Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 7, 8}

Nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all these 3-stars, we get a total of 17 3-stars: [17].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (4, 9, 0)>, 
<4, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 8, 3)>, 
<8, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (1, 8, 3)>
