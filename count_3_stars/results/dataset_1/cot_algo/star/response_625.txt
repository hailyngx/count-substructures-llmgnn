Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5], and the unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
