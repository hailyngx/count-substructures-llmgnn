Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges. Then we'll identify the 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors.

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Now, we check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3, Node 4, and Node 9 each have 2 neighbors, so they cannot form 3-stars.

Considering the 3-stars formed by Node 1 and Node 2, we have:
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
