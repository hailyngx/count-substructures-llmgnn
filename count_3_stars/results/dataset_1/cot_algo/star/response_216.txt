Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 1, 2
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 9
Node 3: 1, 2, 5
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 1, 3, 7
Node 6: 1, 7
Node 7: 2, 5, 6
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 2, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 = 14]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
