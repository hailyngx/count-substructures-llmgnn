Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0 neighbors: 2, 3, 7
Node 2 neighbors: 0
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 7
Node 4 neighbors: 5
Node 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 6
Node 6 neighbors: 5
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 3
Node 8 neighbors: 9
Node 9 neighbors: 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>.
