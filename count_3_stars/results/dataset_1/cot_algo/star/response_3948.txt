Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph represents the following connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6: <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8: <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 5: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <8, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
