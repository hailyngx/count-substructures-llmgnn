Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 7}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-star
- Node 2: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-star
- Node 3: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-star
- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

So, we have a total of 2 3-stars in this graph, which can be expressed as [2]. The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
