Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [10], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
