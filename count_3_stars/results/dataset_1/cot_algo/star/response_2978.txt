Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with neighbors {2, 7, 9}

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [2]

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>
