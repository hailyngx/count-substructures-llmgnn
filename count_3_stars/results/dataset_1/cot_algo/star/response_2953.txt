Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 each have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 25

So, the final result is [25].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>
