Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 9
Node 1 neighbors: 4, 7
Node 2 neighbors: 4, 6, 8
Node 3 neighbors: 9
Node 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 7
Node 5 neighbors: 7, 8, 9
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 7
Node 7 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 5
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 3, 5

Now, we'll check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 7
- Node 9

Next, we'll count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8

Thus, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars found are: <2, (4, 7, 1)>, <2, (4, 7, 6)>, <4, (1, 7, 5)>, <4, (1, 7, 6)>, <4, (2, 7, 6)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>.
