Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the provided information, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

There is no 3-star formed by nodes with less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:

\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 9 \]

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<2, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>
