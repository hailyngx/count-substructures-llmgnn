Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 6, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7
Node 2: 1, 7, 9
Node 3: 1, 8
Node 5: 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 8
Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 9: 0, 2, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: No 3-stars, only 3 neighbors
Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>
Node 2: <2, (1, 7, 9)>
Node 3: No 3-stars, only 2 neighbors
Node 5: No 3-stars, only 3 neighbors
Node 6: <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
Node 7: No 3-stars, only 4 neighbors
Node 8: No 3-stars, only 4 neighbors
Node 9: No 3-stars, only 3 neighbors

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, and <6, (5, 8, 9)>.
