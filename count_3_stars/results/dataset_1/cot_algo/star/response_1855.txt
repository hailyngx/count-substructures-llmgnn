Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we can analyze the neighbors of each node and identify the 3-stars.

### Node Neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8}

### 3-Stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <4, (1, 7, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <8, (2, 3, 9)>
  
There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph, with unique configurations listed above.
