Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
We first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor set {5}
- Node 1: Neighbor set {8}
- Node 2: Neighbor set {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbor set {4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor set {2, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbor set {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbor set {3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor set {5}
- Node 8: Neighbor set {1, 2, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbor set {2, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 5, 8} <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 6, 9} <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {0, 2, 9} <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {3, 8, 9} <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {2, 3, 5} <9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>.
