Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's consider the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [1 + 4] = 5 \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 8, 3)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 4)>
<7, (2, 8, 7)>
