Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors 1, 9
- Node 1: neighbors 0, 3, 6, 8 
- Node 3: neighbor 1
- Node 4: neighbor 6
- Node 5: neighbors 7, 9
- Node 6: neighbors 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: neighbors 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: neighbors 1, 9
- Node 9: neighbors 0, 5, 7, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<1, (0, 8, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 6)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
