Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 7
Node 1: 8
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 6, 9
Node 4: 2
Node 5: - (no neighbors)
Node 6: 3, 9
Node 7: 0, 9
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 3, 6, 7

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 5 has no neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star. 

Now, we can calculate inom{n}{3} for Node 9, which results in 1 3-star:
[1]

The unique 3-star found is:
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the final result is:
[1]
