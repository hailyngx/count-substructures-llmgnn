Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4

Therefore, the final result is [4], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
