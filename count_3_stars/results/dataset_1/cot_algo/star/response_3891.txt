Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node:

For Node 0, we have 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
For Node 1, we have 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
For Node 2, we have 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 3, we have 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
For Node 4, we have 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 6, we have 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
For Node 7, we have 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
For Node 8, we have 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
For Node 9, we have 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

In total, there are 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 12 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>.
