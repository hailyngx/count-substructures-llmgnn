Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 7 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 30, which can be represented as [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (2, 3, 4)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- <7, (4, 6, 7)>
- <7, (6, 7, 1)>
- <7, (6, 1, 2)>
