Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 2, 7

From the neighbor sets, we see that nodes 2 and 7 each have 5 neighbors, so we can form 10 3-stars each with these nodes as the center:

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = 10 + 10 = 20 \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 2)>
<7, (1, 5, 2)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 2)>
<7, (4, 9, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 2)>
<7, (4, 9, 5)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [20].
