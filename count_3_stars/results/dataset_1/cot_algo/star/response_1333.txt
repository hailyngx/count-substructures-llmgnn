Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 2}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of 11 3-stars in this graph. Putting this number inside brackets, we get [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
