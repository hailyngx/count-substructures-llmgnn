Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: can form a 3-star with (6, 7, 8), (6, 7, 9), (6, 8, 9), (7, 8, 9)
- Node 1: can form a 3-star with (2, 6, 8)
- Node 2: can form a 3-star with (1, 5, 7)
- Node 7: can form a 3-star with (0, 2, 6), (0, 2, 8)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 2 (from node 7) = 5

So, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
