Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors (5, 7, 8) <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 6, 9) <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 3, 9) <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 6, 7) <9, (1, 6, 7)> and (3, 5, 7) <9, (3, 5, 7)> 

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
