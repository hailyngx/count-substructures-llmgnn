Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 7, 8
Node 1: 4, 8
Node 2: 3, 7, 8
Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 9
Node 4: 1, 3, 9
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 1, 2
Node 9: 3, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 1 3-star
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 4 3-stars
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 1 3-star
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 4 3-stars
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>
