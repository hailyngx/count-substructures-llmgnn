Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the provided graph information, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5
- Node 3: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3

Next, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 35 + 4 = 39. 

Hence, the final result inside brackets is [39], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>.
