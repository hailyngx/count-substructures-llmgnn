Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Now we can check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: Does not form any 3-stars because it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars [] is 4, and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, and <8, (1, 4, 7)>.
