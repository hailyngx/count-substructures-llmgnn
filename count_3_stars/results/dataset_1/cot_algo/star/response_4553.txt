Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {4, 5}
Node 1: {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: {1, 4}
Node 3: {1, 5, 6}
Node 4: {0, 2, 9}
Node 5: {0, 3, 8, 9}
Node 6: {3, 8}
Node 7: {1}
Node 8: {1, 5, 6}
Node 9: {1, 4, 5}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up: 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 17, so the total number of 3-stars is 17 [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

This completes the analysis.
