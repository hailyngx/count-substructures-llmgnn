Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:  
Node 0 neighbors: 5, 7  
Node 1 neighbors: 2  
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 8  
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 9  
Node 4 neighbors: 7, 9  
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6  
Node 6 neighbors: 5  
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 4, 9  
Node 8 neighbors: 2  
Node 9 neighbors: 3, 4, 7  

Next, we'll find the 3-stars in this graph:
Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, 8: <2, (1, 3, 8)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 5, 9: <3, (2, 5, 9)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, 6: <5, (0, 2, 6)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 4, 9: <7, (0, 4, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4, and the unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>.
