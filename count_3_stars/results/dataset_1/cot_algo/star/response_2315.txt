Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: (4, 9)
- Node 1: (3, 5)
- Node 2: (7)
- Node 3: (1, 4, 8)
- Node 4: (0, 3, 5)
- Node 5: (1, 4, 9)
- Node 6: (7, 8)
- Node 7: (2, 6)
- Node 8: (3, 6)
- Node 9: (0, 5)

Next, we'll check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if any 3-stars can be formed. 

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (7, 8)
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (2, 6)
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (3, 6)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and they are <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>
