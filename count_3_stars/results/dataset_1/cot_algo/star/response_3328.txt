Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 6: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 7: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 8: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 9: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 20 + 20 + 10] = [54] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (4, 3, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
