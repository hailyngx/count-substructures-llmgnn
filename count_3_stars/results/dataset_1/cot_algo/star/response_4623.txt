Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
\[ \text{Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \text{ 3-star.} \]
\[ \text{Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars.} \]
\[ \text{Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars.} \]
\[ \text{Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars.} \]

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13 \), so we have:

\[ [13] \]

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>
