Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

0: 4

1: 3, 4

2: 4, 9

3: 1, 7

4: 0, 1, 2, 9

5: 6, 7, 8

6: 5, 8, 9

7: 3, 5, 8

8: 5, 6, 7

9: 2, 4, 6

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:

0: 4

1: 3, 4

2: 4, 9

3: 1, 7

4: 0, 1, 2, 9

5: 6, 7, 8

6: 5, 8, 9

7: 3, 5, 8

8: 5, 6, 7

9: 2, 4, 6

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 9), so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>

Node 5, 6, and 8 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form 1 3-star each:

<5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7, which can be represented as [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>.
