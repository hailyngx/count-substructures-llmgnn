Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
