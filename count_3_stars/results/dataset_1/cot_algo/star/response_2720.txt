Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7}

Now, for the nodes that have three or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20

Summing up: [1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20] = 39

Therefore, we have a total of 39 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
