Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3
- Node 5: 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 2, 6, 7

Now, we will check for nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the final result is [29] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>.
