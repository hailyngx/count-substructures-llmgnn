Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:  
Node 0 neighbors: 4, 5  
Node 1 neighbors: 5, 6, 8  
Node 3 neighbors: 9  
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8  
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1  
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 4  
Node 7 neighbors: 4  
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 4  
Node 9 neighbors: 3  

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 = 5.  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (5, 6, 8)>  
<4, (0, 6, 8)>  
<4, (0, 7, 8)>  
<4, (6, 7, 8)>  
<4, (0, 6, 7)>  

Therefore, the final result is: [5]  
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>
