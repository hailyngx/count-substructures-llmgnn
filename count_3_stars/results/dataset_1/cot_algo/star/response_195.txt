Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Now, we'll identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
