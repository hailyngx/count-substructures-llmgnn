Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, and Node 8 have 4 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
