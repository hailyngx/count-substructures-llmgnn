Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-star configurations in this graph, we first need to list the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors (1, 7)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (0, 6, 9, 7)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (8)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (9)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (1, 4)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (0, 4)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 9)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (1, 5, 8, 9)

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 4, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-star configurations they can be a part of:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations
  - <1, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <1, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (6, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (0, 6, 7)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star configuration
  - <4, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star configuration
  - <8, (4, 9, 3)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations
  - <9, (1, 5, 8)>
  - <9, (1, 8, 9)>
  - <9, (1, 5, 9)>
  - <9, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star configurations in this graph is [4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 10. 
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 9, 3)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, and <9, (5, 8, 9)>.
