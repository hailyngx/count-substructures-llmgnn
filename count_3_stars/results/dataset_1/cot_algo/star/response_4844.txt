Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6, so the answer is [6].
