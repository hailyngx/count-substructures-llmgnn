Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 6, 7

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [16] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
