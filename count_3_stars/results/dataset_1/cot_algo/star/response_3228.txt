Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7
- Node 6: 0, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 8
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 6

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
