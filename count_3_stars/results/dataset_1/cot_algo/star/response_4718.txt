Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor of nodes 8.
- Node 1: Neighbors of nodes 5, 6.
- Node 2: Neighbors of nodes 3, 8.
- Node 3: Neighbors of nodes 2, 5, 8.
- Node 4: Neighbors of nodes 7, 9.
- Node 5: Neighbors of nodes 1, 3.
- Node 6: Neighbors of nodes 1, 8, 9.
- Node 7: Neighbor of node 4.
- Node 8: Neighbors of nodes 0, 2, 3, 6.
- Node 9: Neighbors of nodes 4, 6.

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the 3-stars involving these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Not enough neighbors for forming a 3-star)
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 (Exactly 3 neighbors forming a 3-star)
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 (Exactly 3 neighbors forming a 3-star)
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 (Four combinations possible for forming 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3), (2, 3, 6), (3, 6, 8), (6, 8, 9)>
