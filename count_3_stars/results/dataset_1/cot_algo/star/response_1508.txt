Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, and Node 7 have 5 neighbors each.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [10 + 10 + 20] = [40] \]

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 3, 5)>
- <0, (4, 3, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
