Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6, 7}

We can observe that nodes 2, 4, 8 have at least 3 neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 56 = 76 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [76] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
