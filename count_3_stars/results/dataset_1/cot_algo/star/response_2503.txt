Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 9
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>
