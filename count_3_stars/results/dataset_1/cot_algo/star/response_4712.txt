Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6)}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has neighbors: {3, 4, 5, 7} - 1 3-star
Node 1 has neighbors: {3, 4, 8, 9} - 1 3-star
Node 3 has neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9} - 20 3-stars
Node 4 has neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7} - 10 3-stars
Node 5 has neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 9} - 4 3-stars
Node 6 has neighbors: {4, 7, 9} - 1 3-star
Node 7 has neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6} - 5 3-stars
Node 9 has neighbors: {1, 3, 5, 6} - 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 4] = [46]
