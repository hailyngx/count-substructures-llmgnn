Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 6, 7, 9
Node 1: 2, 8
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 7, 9
Node 4: 7, 8
Node 5: 7
Node 6: 0, 7
Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 8: 1, 4, 9
Node 9: 0, 3, 7, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 26.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>
