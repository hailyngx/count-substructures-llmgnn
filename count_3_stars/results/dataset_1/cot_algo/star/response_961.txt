Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7
- Node 5: 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [14]
