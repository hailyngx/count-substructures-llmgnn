Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors

Now, we need to calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: 1 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: 1 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10

Putting the final number inside brackets: [10]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
