Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph given has the following structure:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6)
(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9)
(2, 1), (2, 8)
(3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)
(4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 9)
(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 9)
(6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 7)
(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 9)
(8, 2)
(9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
Node 3 has neighbors: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Node 4 has neighbors: {1, 3, 7, 9}
Node 5 has neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 7, 9}
Node 7 has neighbors: {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 1 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [54] with the unique 3-stars as follows: 
<1, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>
