Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (6 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 7, 8, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7 (5 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 5, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 (6 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9: 3, 6, 7, 8 (4 neighbors)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 6 neighbors -> \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2, 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5, 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7, 6 neighbors -> \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8, 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9, 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 
\[ 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 62 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 62. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
