Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 2, 8}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 5}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 8}
Node 4 neighbors: {0, 8}
Node 5 neighbors: {0, 2, 7, 8}
Node 7 neighbors: {0, 5, 8}
Node 8 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 9 neighbors: {8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars with Node 0 as the center. 
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with Node 1 as the center.
Node 2 has only 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars. 
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars with Node 5 as the center.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with Node 7 as the center.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so there are C(6, 3) = 20 3-stars with Node 8 as the center.
Node 9 has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 36

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 7)>, <5, (1, 8, 7)>, <5, (7, 8, 1)>, <5, (8, 0, 7)>, <5, (8, 1, 7)>, <5, (8, 7, 0)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 0, 8)>, <7, (5, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (7, 0, 5)>, <8, (5, 1, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 0)>, <8, (1, 7, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 0, 7)>, <8, (4, 0, 7)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
