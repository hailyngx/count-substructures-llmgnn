Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 7}

Based on the neighbor sets, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
