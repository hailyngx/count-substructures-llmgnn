Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 (degree: 5)
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7 (degree: 3)
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8 (degree: 3)
- Node 3: 2, 5 (degree: 2)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6 (degree: 4)
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4 (degree: 3)
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7 (degree: 3)
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 6 (degree: 4)
- Node 8: 2, 9 (degree: 2)
- Node 9: 8 (degree: 1)

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors: (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 7), (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 7), (1, 6, 7), (4, 5, 6), (4, 5, 7), (4, 6, 7), (5, 6, 7) 
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors: (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 7), (0, 5, 6), (0, 5, 7), (0, 6, 7), (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 7), (1, 6, 7), (5, 6, 7)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors: (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 7), (0, 4, 6), (0, 4, 7), (1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 7), (4, 6, 7)

There are 21 unique 3-stars in this graph. So the final answer is [21].
