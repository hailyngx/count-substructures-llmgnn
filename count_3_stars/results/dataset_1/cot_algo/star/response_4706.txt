Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 4}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 8.
Thus, the result is [8] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
