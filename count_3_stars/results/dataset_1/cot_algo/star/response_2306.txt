Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 7

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors - 1 possible 3-star
- Node 4: 3 neighbors - 1 possible 3-star
- Node 7: 8 neighbors - \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) possible 3-stars

Adding up the possible 3-stars, we get: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 56 = 58 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>
