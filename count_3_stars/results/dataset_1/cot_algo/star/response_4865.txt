Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 5, 8
Node 1: 6, 7
Node 2: 0, 7, 8
Node 3: 8
Node 5: 0, 9
Node 6: 1, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 8
Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 7
Node 9: 5, 6

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>.
