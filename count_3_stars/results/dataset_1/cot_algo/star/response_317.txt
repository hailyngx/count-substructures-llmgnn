Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
  <> <0, (1, 7, 8)>

- Node 1: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
  <> <1, (0, 5, 6)>

- Node 3: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
  <> <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, 
     <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 4: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <> <4, (3, 5, 7)>

- Node 6: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
  <> <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 8: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
  <> <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, 
     <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 9: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
  <> <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [27].
