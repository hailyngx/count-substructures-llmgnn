Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 1

Next, we will identify the 3-stars based on the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 2), (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 3, 4)>

Since each of these nodes has exactly 3 neighbors, we have one 3-star for each of them. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
