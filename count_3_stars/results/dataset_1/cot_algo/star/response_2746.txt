Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors (3-stars possible)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (3-stars possible)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (3-stars possible)

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>
