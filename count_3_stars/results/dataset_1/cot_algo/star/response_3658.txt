Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 0, 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
