Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 2 and 4
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 4, 5, and 6
- Node 3: neighbors are 6 and 8
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 2, and 9
- Node 5: neighbor is 2
- Node 6: neighbors are 2, 3, 7, and 9
- Node 7: neighbors are 6 and 8
- Node 8: neighbors are 3 and 7
- Node 9: neighbors are 4 and 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula:
\[ \binom{n}{3} \]

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 1 + 4] = [9] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 9, 2)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <6, (7, 3, 9)>
