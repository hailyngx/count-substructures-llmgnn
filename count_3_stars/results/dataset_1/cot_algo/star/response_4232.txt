Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6, 9
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star (<3, (6, 9)>)
- Node 6: 1 3-star (<6, (3, 4, 5)>)
- Node 7: 1 3-star (<7, (0, 6, 9)>)
- Node 9: 1 3-star (<9, (0, 3, 7)>)

Total number of 3-stars: [4]
