Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [9]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>
