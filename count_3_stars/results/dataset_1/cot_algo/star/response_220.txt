Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
Since there are 10 nodes in the graph, we need to determine the 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors.

For node 0:
Neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 7
Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>

For node 1:
Neighbors: 0, 2, 5
Number of 3-stars: 1 (as it only has 3 neighbors)
Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 5)>

For node 2:
Neighbors: 1, 4, 5
Number of 3-stars: 1 (as it only has 3 neighbors)
Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 5)>

For node 3:
Neighbor: 5
Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 4:
Neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
Number of 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 5:
Neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
Number of 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>

For node 6:
Neighbors: 4, 8
Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 7:
Neighbors: 0, 4, 5
Number of 3-stars: 1 (as it only has 3 neighbors)
Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 5)>

For node 8:
Neighbor: 6
Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 9:
Neighbor: 4
Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1] = 27. 

Therefore, the final result is [27].
