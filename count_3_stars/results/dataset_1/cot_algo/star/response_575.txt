Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 2 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <2, (1, 9, 4)>
- Node 3 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <9, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6, and the unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 9, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>.
