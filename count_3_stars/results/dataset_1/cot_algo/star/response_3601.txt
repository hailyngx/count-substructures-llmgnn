Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 0, 4

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 5 neighbors
- Node 7, 3 neighbors

Now, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 = 11
So, the final answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (8, 7, 9)>
<0, (8, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 4)>
