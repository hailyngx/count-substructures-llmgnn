Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 1, 8, and 9 have 5, 5, and 3 neighbors respectively, so they can form 10 + 10 + 3 = 23 3-stars.
- Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6 have less than 3 neighbors, so they don't form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 doesn't have 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 23, which we represent as [23]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
