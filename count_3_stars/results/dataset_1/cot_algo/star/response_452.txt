Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's map out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {3}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {3}
- Node 7: neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {7}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- No other node has 3 or more neighbors, so the only 3-star comes from Node 3

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 10, and the unique 3-stars are <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, and <3, (5, 6, 7)>.
