Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 6, 9)> [1]
- Node 1: <1, (6, 7, 9)> [1]
- Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)> [9]
- Node 5: <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)> [3]
- Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)> [4]
- Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)> [8]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [26].
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>
