Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor {9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
