Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, thus forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, thus forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors, thus forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors, thus forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, thus forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors, thus forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, thus forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 16. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
