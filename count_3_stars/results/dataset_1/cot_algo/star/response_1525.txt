Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

For each node, let's list its neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 5, 7

Nodes 5, 6, and 7 have 6 neighbors each, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \([ \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} ] = 20 + 20 + 20 = 60\)

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].
