Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 4: 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Next, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 7 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 and Node 4 have 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \), which we will put inside brackets.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
