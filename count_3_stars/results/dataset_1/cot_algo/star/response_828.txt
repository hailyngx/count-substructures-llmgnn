Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {0, 1}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 38 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 7, 9)>
