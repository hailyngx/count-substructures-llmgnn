Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars: 
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the 3-stars found are:
<[0, (2, 4, 6)]>
<[0, (2, 4, 5)]>
<[0, (2, 5, 6)]>
<[0, (4, 5, 8)]>
<[4, (0, 6, 8)]>
<[4, (1, 6, 8)]>
<[4, (1, 8, 9)]>
<[4, (6, 8, 9)]>
<[4, (8, 9, 7)]>
<[8, (3, 4, 9)]>
<[8, (3, 4, 5)]>
<[8, (4, 5, 9)]>
<[8, (5, 9, 7)]>
<[8, (5, 9, 4)]>
<[8, (5, 9, 4)]>
<[9, (4, 7, 8)]>
<[9, (4, 8, 8)]>
<[9, (7, 8, 8)]>

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
