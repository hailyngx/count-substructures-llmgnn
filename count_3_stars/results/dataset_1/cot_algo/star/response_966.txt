Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors exactly, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors exactly, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
