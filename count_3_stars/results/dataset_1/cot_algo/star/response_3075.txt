Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 5
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-star graph structures:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Now calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [5] \]

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 4)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>
