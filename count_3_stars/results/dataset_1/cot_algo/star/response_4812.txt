Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph using the adjacency list:

0: 1, 5, 6, 8
1: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
2: 7, 8
3: 1, 4
4: 1, 3, 7, 9
5: 0, 8, 9
6: 0, 7, 8
7: 1, 2, 4, 6
8: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
9: 1, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 1: It has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 9: They have fewer than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-star.
For node 4: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 7: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 8: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get a total of 42 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final result will be: 
[42]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>.
