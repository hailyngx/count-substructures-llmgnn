Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 = 11 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (7, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 5)>
<0, (7, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 5)>
