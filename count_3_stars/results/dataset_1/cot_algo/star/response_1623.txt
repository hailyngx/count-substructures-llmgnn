Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges in a more readable format:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. For node 0, it has 5 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 7, 9), so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center:
    - <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>
   
2. For node 1, it has 6 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8), so we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center:
    - <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>

The total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 20 = 30, which can be written as [30].
