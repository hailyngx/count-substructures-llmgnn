Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 2, 6, 8
Node 1: 5, 9
Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 9
Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 9
Node 4: 3, 6, 7
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 0, 4, 8
Node 7: 2, 3, 4
Node 8: 0, 6
Node 9: 1, 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Since nodes 0, 2, and 3 are the only ones with three or more neighbors, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 9, which we put inside brackets: [9].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
