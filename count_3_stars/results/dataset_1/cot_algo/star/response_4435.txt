Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1 and 5
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 4, and 6
- Node 2: Neighbor is 8
- Node 3: Neighbor is 4
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 3, and 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0 and 6
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 7: Neighbor is 6
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2 and 4
- Node 9: Neighbor is 6

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 6, and 8: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 5, and 7: <6, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
