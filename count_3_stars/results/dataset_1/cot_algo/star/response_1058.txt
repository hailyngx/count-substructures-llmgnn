Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor set is {2}.
- Node 2: Neighbor set is {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}.
- Node 3: Neighbor set is {2}.
- Node 5: Neighbor set is {2}.
- Node 6: Neighbor set is {2}.
- Node 8: Neighbor set is {2}.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
