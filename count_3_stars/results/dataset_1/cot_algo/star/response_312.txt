Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5
- Node 8: 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each of those nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 20 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [20] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (6, 8, 9)>
