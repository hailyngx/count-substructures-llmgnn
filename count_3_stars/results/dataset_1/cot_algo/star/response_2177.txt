Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [17].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <0, (7, 6, 8)>
- <0, (7, 8, 6)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (7, 0, 8)>
- <6, (7, 8, 0)>
- <6, (8, 0, 7)>
- <6, (8, 7, 0)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (0, 8, 6)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <7, (6, 0, 8)>
- <7, (6, 8, 0)>
- <7, (8, 0, 6)>
- <7, (8, 6, 0)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
- <8, (0, 7, 6)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 0, 7)>
- <8, (6, 7, 0)>
- <8, (7, 0, 6)>

- <9, (7, 8, 2)>
- <9, (8, 2, 7)>
- <9, (8, 7, 2)>
