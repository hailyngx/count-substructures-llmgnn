Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 6
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 38, and they are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
