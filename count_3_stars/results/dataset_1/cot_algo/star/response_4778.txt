Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list to make it easier to analyze:

Node 0: 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 1: 4, 7
Node 2: 5, 6
Node 3: 4, 7
Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 8
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 9
Node 8: 0, 6, 9
Node 9: 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4, 6, 7, 8 as neighbors. Since it has 4 neighbors, it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
These are: <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>

Node 1 has 4, 7 as neighbors. As it has only 2 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 2 has 5, 6 as neighbors. As it has only 2 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 3 has 4, 7 as neighbors. As it has only 2 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 4 has 0, 1, 3, 6 as neighbors. Since it has 4 neighbors, it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
These are: <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>

Node 5 has 2 as a neighbor. As it has only 1 neighbor, it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 6 has 0, 2, 4, 8 as neighbors. Since it has 4 neighbors, it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
These are: <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>

Node 7 has 0, 1, 3, 9 as neighbors. Since it has 4 neighbors, it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
These are: <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>

Node 8 has 0, 6, 9 as neighbors. Since it has 3 neighbors, it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
This is: <8, (0, 6, 9)>

Node 9 has 7, 8 as neighbors. As it has only 2 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars [] = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13
Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>
