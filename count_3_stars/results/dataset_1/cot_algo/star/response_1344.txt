Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 4, 9. (<1, (2, 4, 9)>)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, 7. (<4, (0, 1, 7)>)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 3, 9. (<6, (0, 3, 9)>)

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
