Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 4 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
