Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6}

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1, 4 unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 3, 6 unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 4, 1 unique 3-star: <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 5, 1 unique 3-star: <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 6, 1 unique 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 13.
