Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7

Now let's list the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 8)>

There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.
