Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 2, 6, 8
Node 1: 2, 6
Node 2: 0, 1, 3
Node 3: 2, 7
Node 4: 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 1, 9
Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 8: 0, 4, 5
Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Next, we'll check for nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 0: forms 1 3-star
Node 2: forms 1 3-star
Node 4: forms 1 3-star
Node 6: forms 1 3-star
Node 7: forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 8: forms 1 3-star
Node 9: forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10] with the unique 3-stars being:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
