Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- 0: 6
- 1: 6, 9
- 2: 4
- 3: 8
- 4: 2, 8
- 5: 7, 9
- 6: 0, 1, 7
- 7: 5, 6, 8, 9
- 8: 3, 4, 7
- 9: 1, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (2, 8, 7)>
- Node 7 forms two 3-stars: <7, (5, 8, 9)> and <7, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
