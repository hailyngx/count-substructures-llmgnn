Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
  These 3-stars are: <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>
  
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
