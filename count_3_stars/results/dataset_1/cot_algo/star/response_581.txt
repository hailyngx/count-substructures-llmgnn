Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
We first determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 4, 8}
Node 1: {2, 5}
Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 7}
Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 4: {0, 2, 5}
Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 7}
Node 6: {3, 5}
Node 7: {2, 3, 5}
Node 8: {0, 3}
Node 9: {3}

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
