Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 4 and 7
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 4, and 5
- Node 2: Neighbor is 4
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 4, 5, and 7
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0 and 6
- Node 8: Neighbors are 3 and 4
- Node 9: Neighbors are 3, 4, and 5

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 4, and 5 - <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, and 9 - <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 5 - <4, (1, 2, 5)> and another with neighbors 1, 6, 8 - <4, (1, 6, 8)> and another with neighbors 5, 6, 9 - <4, (5, 6, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>.
