Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 9
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 5: 1, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star

Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 24

So, [24] 3-stars are formed in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 0)>
<5, (7, 8, 1)>
<6, (4, 0, 7)>
<8, (5, 0, 2)>
