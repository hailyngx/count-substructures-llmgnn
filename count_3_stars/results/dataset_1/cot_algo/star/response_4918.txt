Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given that this graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbor {1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbor {1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6}

Now, we identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

In total, there are 20 + 4 + 4 = 28 3-stars in this graph.
  
The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>.

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [28].
