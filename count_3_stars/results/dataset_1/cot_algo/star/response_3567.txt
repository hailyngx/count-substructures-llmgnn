Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (2, 3, 5)>
  - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
  - <0, (2, 5, 7)>
  - <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (0, 4, 6)>
  - <2, (0, 4, 8)>
  - <2, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (2, 3, 8)>
  - <4, (2, 3, 9)>
  - <4, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <4, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <4, (2, 8, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 6, 8)>
  - <4, (3, 6, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 8, 9)>
  - <4, (6, 8, 9)>
  - <4, (8, 9, 9)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (2, 4, 8)>
  - <6, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <6, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (2, 3, 4)>
  - <8, (2, 3, 9)>
  - <8, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <8, (2, 4, 9)>
  - <8, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <8, (3, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (4, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (4, 9, 9)>
  - <8, (6, 9, 9)>

Considering the total count of 3-stars from all nodes, the sum is 32. Therefore, the final answer is [32].
