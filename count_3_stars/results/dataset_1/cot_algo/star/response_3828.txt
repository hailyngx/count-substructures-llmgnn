Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 0, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26

Therefore, the final result is [26] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
