Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: neighbors are 4 and 8
- Node 1: neighbor is 8
- Node 2: neighbors are 6, 8, and 9
- Node 3: neighbor is 4
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 3, 7, and 8
- Node 5: neighbor is 8
- Node 6: neighbor is 2
- Node 7: neighbors are 4 and 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: neighbors are 2, 7, and 8

Now we see that nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with them:

- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 16, so we have [16].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (8, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
