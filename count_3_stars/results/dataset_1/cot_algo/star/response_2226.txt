Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, and 7 have 4 neighbors each, which gives us a total of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 6 + 4 + 4 = 14 \)

Finally, let's list the unique 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (1, 7, 9)>
3. <0, (6, 7, 9)>
4. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
5. <1, (0, 5, 9)>
6. <1, (4, 5, 9)>
7. <1, (7, 9, 0)>
8. <7, (0, 1, 2)>
9. <7, (0, 1, 8)>
10. <7, (0, 2, 8)>
11. <7, (1, 2, 8)>
12. <7, (1, 8, 9)>
13. <7, (2, 8, 9)>
14. <7, (8, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14].
