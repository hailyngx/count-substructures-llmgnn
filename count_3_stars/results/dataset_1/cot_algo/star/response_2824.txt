Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5

Next, let's identify the 3-star clusters:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 1: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
- Node 2: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
- Node 3: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
- Node 4: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 5: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
- Node 6: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 7: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 8: 1 neighbor, no 3-star formed.
- Node 9: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4
So, the final answer is [4].
