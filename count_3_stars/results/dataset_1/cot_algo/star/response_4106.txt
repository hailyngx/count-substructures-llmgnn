Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list all the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 9
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 35. 

Therefore, the final answer is [35] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 2, 8, 9>
- <0, 2, 9, 4>
- <0, 2, 9, 5>
- <1, 2, 8, 9>
- <1, 2, 9, 4>
- <1, 2, 9, 5>
