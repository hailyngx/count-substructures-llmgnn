Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 7}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [\[ \binom{3}{3} \] = 1]
- Node 1: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]
- Node 2: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- Node 3: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]
- Node 4: [\[ \binom{6}{3} \] = 20]
- No 3-stars can be formed with nodes 5, 6, 7, or 9 as they have less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 49]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (8, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
