Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list all the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2
- Node 6: 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 6, 7

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is the sum of the 3-stars from each applicable node: 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 26.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 7, 9)>
- <7, (4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (6, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- <7, (3, 1, 6)>
