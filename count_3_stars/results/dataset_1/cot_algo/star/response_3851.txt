Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (8)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (5, 6)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (1, 7)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (5, 6, 9)
- Node 5: 6 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 8)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 7)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (4, 5, 6)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 5 neighbors, inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5, 6 neighbors, inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 6, 5 neighbors, inom{5}{3} = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 20 + 10] = [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 6, 9)>
