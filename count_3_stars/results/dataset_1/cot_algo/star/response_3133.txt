Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 8

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>
