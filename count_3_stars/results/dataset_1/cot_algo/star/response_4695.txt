Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 7, 9
Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7
Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 7
Node 6: 3, 8
Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5
Node 8: 6
Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 7 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives a total of 57. So, the final answer is [57].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
