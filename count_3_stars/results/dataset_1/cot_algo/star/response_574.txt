Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [10]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 8, 0)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <8, (6, 9, 1)>
