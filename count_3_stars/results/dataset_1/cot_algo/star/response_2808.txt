Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {8, 9}
- Node 2: {8, 9}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 4}
- Node 6: {4, 8}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0: No 3-star formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-star formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: No 3-star formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-star formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-star formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: No 3-star formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-star formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-star formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 8: <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>.
- Node 9: There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 9: <9, (1, 2, 8)>.

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 1] = 5 \)   
Unique 3-stars found: <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>.
