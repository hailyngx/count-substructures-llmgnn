Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 5)>
Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 7, 8)>
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 6)>
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
The 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>
