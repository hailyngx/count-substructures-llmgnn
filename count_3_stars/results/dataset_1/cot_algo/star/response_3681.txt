Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-star graphs in this network, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: In this case, inom{5}{3} = 10 possible 3-stars
- Node 3: In this case, inom{5}{3} = 10 possible 3-stars
- Node 8: In this case, inom{6}{3} = 20 possible 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 10 + 20 = 40. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 2>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 9, 8>, <8, 9, 2>, <8, 9, 3> 

Therefore, the final answer is [40].
