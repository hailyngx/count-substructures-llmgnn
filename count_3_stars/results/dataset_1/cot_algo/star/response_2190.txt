Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 8}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 23, which we will put inside brackets: [23].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 7, 6)>
