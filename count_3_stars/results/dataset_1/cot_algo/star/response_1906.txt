Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 1, 9)>, <0, (5, 3, 9)>
- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 0, 9)>, <1, (5, 3, 9)>, <1, (7, 4, 9)>
- Node 3: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 0, 9)>, <3, (5, 1, 9)>, <3, (8, 5, 9)>
- Node 5: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 0, 3)>, <5, (1, 0, 8)>, <5, (2, 0, 3)>, <5, (2, 0, 8)>, <5, (3, 0, 8)>, <5, (8, 0, 1)>
- Node 9: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 0, 2)>, <9, (1, 0, 3)>, <9, (1, 7, 4)>, <9, (2, 0, 3)>, <9, (3, 0, 6)>, <9, (3, 8, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [32]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (5, 1, 9)>
- <0, (5, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 0, 9)>
- <1, (5, 3, 9)>
- <1, (7, 4, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 0, 9)>
- <3, (5, 1, 9)>
- <3, (8, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <5, (1, 0, 3)>
- <5, (1, 0, 8)>
- <5, (2, 0, 3)>
- <5, (2, 0, 8)>
- <5, (3, 0, 8)>
- <5, (8, 0, 1)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 0, 2)>
- <9, (1, 0, 3)>
- <9, (1, 7, 4)>
- <9, (2, 0, 3)>
- <9, (3, 0, 6)>
- <9, (3, 8, 5)>
