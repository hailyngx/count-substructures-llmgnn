Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8

Now, based on the neighbor sets, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 8 neighbors, so it can form inom{8}{3} = 56 3-stars. <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)> are the 5 unique 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <2, (0, 4, 7)> is the unique 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <4, (0, 1, 2)> is the unique 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)> are the unique 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = [56 + 10 + 4 + 10] = [80]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>
