Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
    0 -- 8   
    |     |   
    8 -- 1 -- 4 -- 5 -- 7   
         |     |         |   
         4 -- 3 -- 6     5   
             |   
             9   
```

Let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6:

[6]

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
