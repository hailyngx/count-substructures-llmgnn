Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the combinatorial formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 19 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 9)>
