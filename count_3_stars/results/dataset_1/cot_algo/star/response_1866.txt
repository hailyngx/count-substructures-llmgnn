Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 8}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 possible 3-stars)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 possible 3-star)
- Node 4: Not applicable since it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 possible 3-star)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 possible 3-stars)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
