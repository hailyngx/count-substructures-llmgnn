Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {3, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
