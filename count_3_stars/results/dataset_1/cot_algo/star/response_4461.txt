Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2, 6, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, so we represent this as [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
