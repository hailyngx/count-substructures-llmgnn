Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 7}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9

Calculations:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [17] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (3, 8, 7)>
- <3, (2, 8, 7)>
- <7, (5, 9, 8)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (8, 9, 5)>
- <7, (8, 9, 6)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- <8, (3, 7, 2)>
- <8, (4, 7, 2)>
- <8, (7, 2, 4)>
- <8, (7, 3, 0)>
- <8, (7, 4, 2)>
- <8, (7, 5, 9)>
- <8, (7, 6, 9)>
- <8, (9, 7, 5)>
- <8, (9, 7, 6)>
