Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, 9: <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, 9: <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 7: <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 5: <7, (0, 2, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
