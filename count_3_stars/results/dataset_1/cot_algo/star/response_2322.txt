Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edge list:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 9}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 and Node 9 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8 have more than 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.
  - Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
  - Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 and Node 2 have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 3.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
