Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, we can determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [19], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
