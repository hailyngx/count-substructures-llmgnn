Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars each can form:
- Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 35 + 20 + 10 = 65

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [65].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
These are the unique 3-stars formed in the graph.
