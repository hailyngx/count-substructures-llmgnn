Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10.

So, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
