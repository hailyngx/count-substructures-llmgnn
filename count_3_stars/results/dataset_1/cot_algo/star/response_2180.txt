Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6.
   - There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars from node 0:
     - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
     - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
     - <0, (1, 5, 6)>
     - <0, (4, 5, 6)>

2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 8.
   - There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars from node 1:
     - <1, (0, 2, 6)>
     - <1, (0, 2, 8)>
     - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
     - <1, (2, 6, 8)>

3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 7.
   - There is 1 3-star from node 2:
     - <2, (1, 5, 7)>

4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 8.
   - There is 1 3-star from node 3:
     - <3, (4, 6, 8)>

5. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 6.
   - There is 1 3-star from node 4:
     - <4, (0, 3, 6)>

6. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9.
   - There is 1 3-star from node 5:
     - <5, (0, 2, 9)>

7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8.
   - There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars from node 6:
     - <6, (0, 1, 3)>
     - <6, (0, 1, 4)>
     - <6, (0, 1, 8)>
     - <6, (0, 3, 4)>

8. Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 2, 8. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed.

9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9.
   - There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars from node 8:
     - <8, (1, 3, 6)>
     - <8, (1, 3, 7)>
     - <8, (1, 3, 9)>
     - <8, (3, 6, 7)>

10. Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 5, 8. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 20.
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>.
