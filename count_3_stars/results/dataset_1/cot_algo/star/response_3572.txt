Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 9
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: [2].
