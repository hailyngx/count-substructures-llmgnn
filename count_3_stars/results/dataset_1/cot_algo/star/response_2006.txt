Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 2, 6

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 4, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Thus, the final number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-star found:
<1, (4, 8)>
