Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, Node 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 3: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 4: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 7: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 9: C(5, 3) = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38

So, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
