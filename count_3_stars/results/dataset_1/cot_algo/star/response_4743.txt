Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-star configurations in this graph:

Node 2 has neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 3 has neighbors {2, 6, 9}, forming 1 3-star.
Node 6 has neighbors {3, 4, 5, 9}, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has neighbors {2, 4, 5}, forming 1 3-star.
Node 9 has neighbors {3, 6}, which is less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star forms.

Total 3-stars: \(10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16\) ([])

Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>
