Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 3}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of [19]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 

- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
