Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {1, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 6, 8)>.

So, the final result is [32].
