Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we can start by listing the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 6}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 7}

Next, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given rules:

- Node 0 forms <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 forms <1, (0, 7, 8)> and <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 forms <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, and <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms <7, (0, 1, 6)> and <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 forms <8, (1, 4, 5)> and <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Total 3-stars found: [9]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
