Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:

Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 2: 0, 6
Node 4: 0, 1, 6
Node 5: 0, 1, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8
Node 7: 0, 9
Node 8: 1, 6, 9
Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- For Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- For Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- For Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- For Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- For Node 8: <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- For Node 9: <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
