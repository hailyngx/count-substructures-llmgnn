Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 7
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 0, 4, 8
Node 7: 1, 3, 4
Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 6
Node 9: 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 38.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
