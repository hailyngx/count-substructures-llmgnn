Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 1, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 8)>
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 9)>
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <5, (1, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
