Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, first let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- Since the rest of the nodes have more than 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
  - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
     - <2, (0, 1, 6)>
     - <2, (0, 1, 8)>
     - <2, (0, 6, 8)>
     - <2, (1, 6, 8)>
  - Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
     - <4, (0, 6, 8)>
  - Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
     - <6, (2, 4, 7)>
     - <6, (2, 4, 8)>
     - <6, (2, 4, 9)>
     - <6, (2, 7, 8)>
     - <6, (2, 7, 9)>
     - <6, (2, 8, 9)>
     - <6, (4, 7, 8)>
     - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
     - <6, (4, 8, 9)>
     - <6, (7, 8, 9)>

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10] = [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>.
