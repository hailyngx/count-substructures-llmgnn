Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 7, 9}
Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 6}
Node 2: {1, 7, 8}
Node 3: {0, 1, 9}
Node 4: {7}
Node 5: {1, 7}
Node 6: {1}
Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}
Node 8: {2, 7}
Node 9: {0, 3}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: Forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 1: Forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 2: Forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 3: Forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 7: Forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding them up, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17 [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 5)>
<7, (2, 8, 4)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
