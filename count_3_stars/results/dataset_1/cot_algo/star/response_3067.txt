Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list representing the given graph:

Node 0: 4, 7, 9
Node 1: 3, 5, 9
Node 2: 5
Node 3: 1, 8
Node 4: 0, 6, 8
Node 5: 1, 2, 7
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 0, 5, 9
Node 8: 3, 4
Node 9: 0, 1, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors so there is 1 3-star: <0, (4, 7, 9)>
Node 1 has 3 neighbors so there is 1 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 9)>
Node 4 has 3 neighbors so there is 1 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 8)>
Node 5 has 3 neighbors so there is 1 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 7)>
Node 7 has 3 neighbors so there is 1 3-star: <7, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
