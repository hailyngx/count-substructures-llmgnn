Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first list the neighbors of each node:

Node 1: 5

Node 2: 5

Node 3: 8

Node 4: 5

Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 8

Node 6: 9

Node 7: 9

Node 8: 3, 5

Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 4, which we will represent inside brackets as [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 2, 4)>
<3, (8, 5, 1)>
<3, (8, 5, 2)>
<3, (8, 5, 4)>
<4, (5, 1, 2)>
<4, (5, 1, 4)>
<4, (5, 2, 4)>
<8, (5, 1, 2)>
<8, (5, 1, 4)>
<8, (5, 2, 4)>
