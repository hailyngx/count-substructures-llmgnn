Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 7

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 1: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 2: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 5: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 8: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 2 ([]).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (6, 9, 7)>
- <6, (3, 9, 7)>
