Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we first need to find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 5, 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 2 neighbors: 1, 6
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 3, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 2
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7

Now, we look for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
  The potential 3-stars are <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>.
