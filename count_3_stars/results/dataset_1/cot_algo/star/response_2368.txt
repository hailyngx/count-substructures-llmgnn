Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) with 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

- Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 7 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 1 3-star.

\[ 2 + 2 + 7 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 19 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 5)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<3, (0, 8, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 4)>
<3, (2, 6, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (5, 1, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 3)>
<5, (3, 6, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (9, 7, 3)>
<7, (3, 0, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 1, 4)>
