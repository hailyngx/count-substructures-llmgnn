Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 9
- Node 3: 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 8
- Node 7: 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
For node 3, 7, 8, and 9, they each have 3 or more neighbors. 
So, the total number of 3-stars would be \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 22\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
