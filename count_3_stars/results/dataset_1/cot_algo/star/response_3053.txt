Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given a graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can represent the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 5), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 2, 7
Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 5
Node 3 has neighbors: 6, 7
Node 4 has neighbors: 9
Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 9
Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5
Node 8 has no neighbors
Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we'll analyze them further.

Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
<0, (1, 2, 7)>

Node 1 can form 3 3-stars.
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>

Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
<2, (0, 1, 5)>

Node 5 can form 2 3-stars.
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>

Node 6 can form 2 3-stars.
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>

Node 9 can form 1 3-star.
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1] = 10.
