Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{7}{3} = 35
- Node 1: 0 (since it only has 2 neighbors)
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: 0 (since it only has 3 neighbors)

Adding these up, we find a total of 35 + 0 + 10 + 0 = 45 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [45], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (4, 3, 6)>, <0, (4, 3, 9)>.
