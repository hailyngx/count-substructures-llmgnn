Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 0 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (8, 9, 0)>
<9, (7, 8, 2)>

So, the final answer is [6].
