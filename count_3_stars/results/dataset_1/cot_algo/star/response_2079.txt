Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 5, and Node 8 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1 and Node 6 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 3-stars each.
- Node 2 and Node 3 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 3 \times 4 + 2 \times 4 + 2 \times 1 = 16 + 8 + 2 = 26 \), which can be represented as [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
