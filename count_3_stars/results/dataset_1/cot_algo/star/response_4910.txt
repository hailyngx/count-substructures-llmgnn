Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 9
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 6

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 10 + 4] = [15] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (8, 9, 0)>
