Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: neighbor {4}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: neighbor {1, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 9: neighbor {6}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [23] \)

Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>
