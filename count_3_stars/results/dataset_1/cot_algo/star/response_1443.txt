Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (5, 6, 9)>.
