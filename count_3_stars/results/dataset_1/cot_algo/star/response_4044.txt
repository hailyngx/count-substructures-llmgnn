Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the provided graph information, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 7, 9
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 4, 5, 9
Node 3: 4, 6, 7
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 7
Node 5: 2, 7
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 8: 7
Node 9: 0, 2, 7

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  
Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 20 = 25]

Unique 3-stars:

<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
