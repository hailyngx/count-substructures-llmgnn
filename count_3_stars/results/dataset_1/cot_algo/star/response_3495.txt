Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
