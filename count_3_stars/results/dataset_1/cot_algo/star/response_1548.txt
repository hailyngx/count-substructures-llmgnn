Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 4, 6, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 4 (degree 2)
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5 (degree 4)
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 2, 6, 7 (degree 4)
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 6 (degree 4)
- Node 5: Neighbors are 2 (degree 1)
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 7, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 7: Neighbors are 3, 6 (degree 2)
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0 (degree 1)
- Node 9: Neighbors are 6 (degree 1)

Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars with these nodes as centers. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives us a total of 26 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 2, 4, 6>
- <2, 3, 4, 6>
