Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 8}
- Node 2: neighbor {1}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 4: neighbor {5}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star: <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, forms 4 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6, and they are as follows:
[6]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>
