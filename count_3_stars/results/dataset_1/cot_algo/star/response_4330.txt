Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {0, 1}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>

Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars:
<7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 30.
