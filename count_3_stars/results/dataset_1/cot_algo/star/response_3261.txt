Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 2: neighbor {6}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: neighbor {7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 4, 9): <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 4, 5): <9, (1, 4, 5)>

We found 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final result is [2].
