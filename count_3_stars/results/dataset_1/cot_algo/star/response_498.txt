Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 5}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 7, 8}.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 5)> and <4, (1, 7, 8)>.
