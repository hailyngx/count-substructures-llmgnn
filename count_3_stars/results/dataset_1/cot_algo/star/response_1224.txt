Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors = {2}
- Node 1: neighbors = {3, 5}
- Node 2: neighbors = {0}
- Node 3: neighbors = {1, 7, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors = {6, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors = {1, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors = {4}
- Node 7: neighbors = {3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors = {3, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors = {5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 7, 8} as <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {6, 7, 9} as <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 also forms a 3-star with its neighbors {3, 4, 9} as <7, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3, and they are <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>. 
Putting this final number inside brackets gives us [3].
