Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
  - <1, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
