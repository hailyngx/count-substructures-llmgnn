Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 5, 9)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1, so we put it inside brackets [].
The unique 3-star found is <3, (2, 5, 9)>.
