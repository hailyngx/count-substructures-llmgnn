Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:  
Node 1: {4, 7}  
Node 2: {3, 4, 8}  
Node 3: {2, 9}  
Node 4: {1, 2, 6}  
Node 6: {4}  
Node 7: {1}  
Node 8: {2, 9}  
Node 9: {3, 8}  
  
Now, let's find the 3-stars:  
Node 2 and Node 8 have 3 neighbors, so they can form a 3-star.  
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.  
Node 1, Node 3, Node 6, and Node 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form a 3-star.  
  
Total number of 3-stars: 2 (put inside brackets) => [2]  
  
Unique 3-stars found:  
<2, (4, 8, 9)>  
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
