Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's identify the 3-star structures present in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {4, 8, 9}. There is 1 3-star formed with node 0, which is <0, (4, 8, 9)>.

2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {5, 7, 9, 7}. There is 1 3-star formed with node 2, which is <2, (5, 7, 9)>.

4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {1, 5, 8}. There is 1 3-star formed with node 3, which is <3, (1, 5, 8)>.

5. Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {2, 3, 8, 9}. There is 1 3-star formed with node 5, which is <5, (2, 3, 9)>.

7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
9. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}. There are 2 3-stars formed with node 8, which are <8, (0, 3, 6)> and <8, (0, 3, 7)>.

10. Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: [1+1+1+1+1+2] = 7
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the final result is [7].
