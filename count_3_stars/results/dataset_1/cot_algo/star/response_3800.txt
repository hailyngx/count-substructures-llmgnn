Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 9 (<3, (7, 8, 9)>).
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8 (<7, (4, 5, 8)>).
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9, and 6 (<2, (3, 9, 6)>).

There are 3 unique 3-stars, so the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
