Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 1, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- node 5: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\)

Therefore, the final answer is [9], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 7)>
