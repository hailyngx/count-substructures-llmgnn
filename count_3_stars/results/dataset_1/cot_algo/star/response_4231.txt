Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Yes, with neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Yes, with neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Yes, with neighbors {5, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Yes, with neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: Yes, with neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20
So, the total number of 3-stars is [20].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 7)>
