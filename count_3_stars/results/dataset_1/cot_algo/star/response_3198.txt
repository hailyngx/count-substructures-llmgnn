Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].    
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>.
