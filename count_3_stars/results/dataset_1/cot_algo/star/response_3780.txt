Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's start by finding the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 3, 7
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6
Node 2 neighbors: 1
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7
Node 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6
Node 5 neighbors: 4, 7
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6
Node 8 neighbors: 6, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 6, 8

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors
Node 1 has 4 neighbors
Node 3 has 4 neighbors
Node 4 has 3 neighbors
Node 6 has 5 neighbors
Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 24 \]

So, there are 24 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 5, 6)>
