Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, forming [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, forming [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>.
