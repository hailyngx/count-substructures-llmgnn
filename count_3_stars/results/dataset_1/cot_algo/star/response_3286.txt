Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {0, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star. <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 1 = 9]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>
