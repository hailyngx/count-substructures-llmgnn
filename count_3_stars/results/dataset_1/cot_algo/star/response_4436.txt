Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 8  
Node 1: 2, 4, 5  
Node 2: 1  
Node 4: 1, 7  
Node 5: 1, 6  
Node 6: 5, 7  
Node 7: 4, 6, 8  
Node 8: 0, 7  

Now, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:  
For Node 1, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.  
For Node 7, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (2, 4, 5)>  
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
