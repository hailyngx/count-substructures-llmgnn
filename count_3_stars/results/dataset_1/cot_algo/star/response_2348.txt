Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 have 4 neighbors each.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
