Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find all the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors

For node 2:
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed around node 2.
- The unique 3-stars around node 2 are: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>.

For node 8:
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed around node 8.
- The unique 3-star around node 8 is: <8, (4, 6, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4+1] = 5.
