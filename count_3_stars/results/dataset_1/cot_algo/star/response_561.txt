Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each node can form:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 8) + 10 (from node 9) = 17

So, the final result is [17] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
- <9, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (6, 8, 9)>
- <9, (7, 8, 9)>
