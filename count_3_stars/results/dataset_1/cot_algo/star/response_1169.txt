Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 3, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 9}
Node 2 neighbors: {7, 9}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 6}
Node 4 neighbors: {7, 9}
Node 5 neighbors: {3, 6, 9}
Node 6 neighbors: {3, 5, 9}
Node 7 neighbors: {2, 4, 8}
Node 8 neighbors: {7}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6}

Now, we will determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 20 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
