Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 4, and 0: <1, (0, 2, 4)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 9, and 1: <3, (1, 5, 9)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 8, 9, and 1: <4, (1, 8, 9)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 7, 9, and 3: <5, (3, 7, 9)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, and 3: <9, (3, 4, 5)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars formed in this graph. Therefore, the final count is [5].
