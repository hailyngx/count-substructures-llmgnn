Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {2}
- Node 7: neighbors {3}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-star graphs:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 5, 8}: <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 3, 6}: <2, (5, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 5, 7}: <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 3, 8}: <5, (0, 3, 8)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>.
