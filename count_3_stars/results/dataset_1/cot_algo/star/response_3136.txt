Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 9
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. (1 combination)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. (4 combinations)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. (4 combinations)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. (1 combination)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. (4 combinations)
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars. (20 combinations)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20] = 34.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 2)>
<8, (9, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 0, 2)>
<9, (2, 1, 0)>
<9, (0, 2, 1)>
<9, (2, 8, 1)>
<9, (8, 2, 1)>
<9, (2, 1, 8)>
<9, (1, 8, 2)>
<9, (8, 1, 2)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 8, 4)>
<9, (4, 8, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 3)>
<9, (4, 3, 8)>
<9, (8, 3, 4)>
<9, (5, 0, 1)>
<9, (5, 1, 0)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 0)>
<9, (5, 2, 0)>
<9, (5, 0, 2)>
<9, (2, 0, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 2)>
