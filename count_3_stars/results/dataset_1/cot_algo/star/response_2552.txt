Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {3, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars (since it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0 3-stars (since it has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (<2, (0, 1, 3)>)
- Node 3: 0 3-stars (since it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0 3-stars (since it has only 1 neighbor)
- Node 5: 0 3-stars (since it has only 1 neighbor)
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (since it has only 1 neighbor)
- Node 7: 0 3-stars (since it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (<9, (4, 6, 7)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 1, 3)> and <9, (4, 6, 7)>.
