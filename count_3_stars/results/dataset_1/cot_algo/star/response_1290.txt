Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 6) = 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>
