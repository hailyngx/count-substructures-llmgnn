Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 0, 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 8

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
