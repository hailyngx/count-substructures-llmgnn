Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, let's analyze the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has neighbors 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 has neighbors 8 and 9.
- Node 2 has neighbors 3, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 has neighbors 0, 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 has neighbors 2, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 has neighbors 0, 2, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 has neighbors 0 and 3.
- Node 7 has neighbors 0, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 has neighbors 1, 4, 7.
- Node 9 has neighbors 1, 2, 5, 7.

Now, let's find the 3-stars and count them:

1. For node 0: Since it has 4 neighbors, it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>
  
The total count of 3-stars can be calculated as the sum of individual node 3-stars:
4 3-stars from node 0.

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
