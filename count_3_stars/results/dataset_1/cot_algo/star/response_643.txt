Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 4, 5
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: neighbor is 3
- Node 3: neighbors are 2, 4
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 5
- Node 7: neighbor is 4
- Node 8: neighbor is 1
- Node 9: neighbors are 1, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 20, so the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>
