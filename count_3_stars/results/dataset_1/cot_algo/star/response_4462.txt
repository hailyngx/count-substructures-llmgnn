Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6, 7}

Next, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4: 6 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 48, so the total number of 3-stars is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
