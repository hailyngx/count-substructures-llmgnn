Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and the specified edges, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph by following the process described earlier. 

1. **Neighbor nodes for each node**:
   - Node 0: {2, 4, 7, 8}
   - Node 1: {6, 8}
   - Node 2: {0, 6, 7}
   - Node 3: {4, 7}
   - Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 7}
   - Node 5: {4, 8, 9}
   - Node 6: {1, 2, 8}
   - Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4}
   - Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 6}
   - Node 9: {5}

2. **3-stars**:
   - Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 7)>
   - Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 6, 7)>
   - Node 4 forms 3 3-stars: 
     - <4, (0, 3, 7)>
     - <4, (0, 5, 7)>
     - <4, (3, 5, 7)>
   - Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (4, 8, 9)>
   - Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 6)>

3. **Total number of 3-stars** = 5 = [5]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5, and they are <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, and <5, (4, 8, 9)>.
