Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
For this graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {4, 7}
- Node 3: {7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {2, 3}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

So, there is 1 unique 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
