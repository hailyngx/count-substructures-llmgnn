Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7
- Node 9: 7

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 8: <0, (5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 6, 7: <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 6, 8: <7, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
