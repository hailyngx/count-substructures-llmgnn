Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 8}

Next, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: forms 4 3-stars

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 8) = 8

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
