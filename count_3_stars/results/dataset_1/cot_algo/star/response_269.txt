Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 3, 7
- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 1
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 4
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 0
- Node 8 neighbors: 3, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3 has 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>
