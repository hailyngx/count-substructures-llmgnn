Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Now, we can see that nodes 1, 4, and 5 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 
\[ [4 + 4 + 1] = [9] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
