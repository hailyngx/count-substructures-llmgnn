Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 7)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (nodes 4, 5)
- Node 2: Isolated
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (nodes 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 8, 9)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (nodes 3, 9)
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (node 0)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 6, 9)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (6, 8, 9) <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (8, 5, 9) <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 8, 9) <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 4, 5) <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors (4, 5, 6) <9, (4, 5, 6)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in total, so the final result is [5].
