Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 6, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
