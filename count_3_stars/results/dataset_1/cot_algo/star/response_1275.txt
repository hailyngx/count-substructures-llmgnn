Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3
- Node 9: 1

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: Does not form any 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Does not form any 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Does not form any 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: Does not form any 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 9: Does not form any 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found is: <2, (5, 6, 8)>
