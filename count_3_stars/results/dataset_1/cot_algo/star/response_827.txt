Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [36]
