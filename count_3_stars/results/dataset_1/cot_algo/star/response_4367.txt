Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 8

Based on the given information, we can calculate the number of 3-stars as follows:
- For node 0: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( [56 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [81] \).

The unique 3-stars identified in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
