Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 7}

Next, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, 9. <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, 9. <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 8, 9, 5. <4, (8, 9, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, 7. <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, 4, and 7. <9, (1, 3, 4)> <9, (1, 4, 7)> <9, (1, 3, 7)> <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
