Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5C3 = 10 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 10] = [16], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>.
