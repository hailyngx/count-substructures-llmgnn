Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, for each node, let's list its neighbors:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12 \)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars are:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
