Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 6, 9
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4
- Node 7: 3
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3

Now, let's check how many 3-stars can be formed with each node:
- Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 4: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: <6, (1, 0, 4)> 
- Node 7: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are <6, (1, 0, 4)>.
