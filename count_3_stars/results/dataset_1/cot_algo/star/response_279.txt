Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's define the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars is [4].
