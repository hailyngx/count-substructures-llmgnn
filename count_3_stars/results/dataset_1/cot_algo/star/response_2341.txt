Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, and <8, (0, 1, 7)>.
