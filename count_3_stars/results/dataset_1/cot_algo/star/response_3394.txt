Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 7}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>
