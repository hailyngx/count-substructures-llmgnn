Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can analyze the 3-stars within this graph.

First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 5, 6
- Node 3: Neighbor is 1
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 1, 4
- Node 8: Neighbor is 5
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, thus \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
  <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 2)>, 
  <1, (0, 5, 2)>, <1, (4, 5, 2)>, <1, (0, 7, 2)>, <1, (4, 7, 2)>, <1, (5, 7, 2)>, 
  <1, (0, 4, 3)>, <1, (0, 4, 1)>, <1, (0, 5, 3)>, <1, (0, 5, 1)>, <1, (4, 5, 3)>, 
  <1, (4, 5, 1)>, <1, (0, 7, 3)>, <1, (0, 7, 1)>, <1, (4, 7, 3)>, <1, (4, 7, 1)>

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, thus there's 1 3-star: 
  <0, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20 + 1 = 21].
