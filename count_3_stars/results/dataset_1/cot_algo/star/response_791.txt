Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 9
Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 8
Node 2: 1, 4
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 3, 6, 8
Node 6: 1, 5
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 1, 5, 9
Node 9: 0, 8

Next, we'll identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 1 = 6]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
