Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6}
- Nodes 2, 9: Isolated nodes

Next, we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Now, we add up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [1] \]

The unique 3-star found is:
\[ <6, (1, 4, 8)> \]
