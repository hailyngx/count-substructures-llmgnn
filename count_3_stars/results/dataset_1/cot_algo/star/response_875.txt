Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 7}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 35 + 1 + 1 = 38, which we put inside brackets as [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
