Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
