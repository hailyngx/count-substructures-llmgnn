Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) for Node 0
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) for Node 5
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) for Node 6
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) for Node 7
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) for Node 9

Total 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
