Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 6}

Now, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 7 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 35 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>
