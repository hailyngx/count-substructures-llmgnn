Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star

Adding these up gives a total of [3] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
