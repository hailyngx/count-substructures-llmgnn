Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {8}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Then, we list the unique 3-stars found:

<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars found are as listed above.
