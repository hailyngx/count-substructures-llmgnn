Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2: Selecting 3 neighbors out of 5 (1, 3, 6, 7, 9) forms 3-stars. Hence, there are 10 3-stars.
- Node 6: Selecting 3 neighbors out of 5 (2, 4, 5, 7, 9) forms 3-stars. Hence, there are 10 3-stars.
- Node 9: Selecting 3 neighbors out of 7 (0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) forms 3-stars. Hence, there are 35 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 10 + 35 = 55].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
