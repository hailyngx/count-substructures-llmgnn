Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 20 3-stars in this graph.
Thus, the final answer is [20] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>.
