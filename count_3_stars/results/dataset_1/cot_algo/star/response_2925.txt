Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms the 3-star: <0, (3, 9)>
- Node 1 forms the 3-star: <1, (6, 9)>
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars: <3, (0, 4, 5)> and <3, (6, 4, 5)>
- Node 6 forms the 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 9 forms the 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 9)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars formed, so the final answer is [5].
