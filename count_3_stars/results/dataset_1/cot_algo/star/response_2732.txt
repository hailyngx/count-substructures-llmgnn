Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we can represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: {4, 9}
Node 1: {3}
Node 2: {5, 7, 9}
Node 3: {1}
Node 4: {0, 9}
Node 5: {2, 6, 9}
Node 6: {5, 8, 9}
Node 7: {2}
Node 8: {6, 9}
Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's analyze each node's neighbor set to identify 3-stars:

For Node 0: Neighbors {4, 9}
    - There are less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.

For Node 1: Neighbors {3}
    - There are less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.

For Node 2: Neighbors {5, 7, 9}
    - There are 3 neighbors, so 1 unique 3-star: <2, (5, 7, 9)>
    - \(inom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.

For Node 3: Neighbors {1}
    - There are less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.

For Node 4: Neighbors {0, 9}
    - There are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.

For Node 5: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
    - There are 3 neighbors, so 1 unique 3-star: <5, (2, 6, 9)>
    - \(inom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.

For Node 6: Neighbors {5, 8, 9}
    - There are 3 neighbors, so 1 unique 3-star: <6, (5, 8, 9)>
    - \(inom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.

For Node 7: Neighbors {2}
    - There are less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.

For Node 8: Neighbors {6, 9}
    - There are less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.

For Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
    - There are 6 neighbors, so \(inom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 23\)

Therefore, the final answer is [23]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, and <6, (5, 8, 9)>.
