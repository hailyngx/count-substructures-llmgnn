Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes, let's label them from 0 to 9. The given set of edges can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.

Now, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {4}

Now, we'll determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 10 + 4] = [18] \).

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
