Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Counting these up, we have a total of 9 three-stars in the graph:
\[ [9] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>
