Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 35.

Therefore, the final result is [35], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>.
