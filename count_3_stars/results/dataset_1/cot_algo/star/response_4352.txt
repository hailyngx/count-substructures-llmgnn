Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with neighbors 1, 6, 9: <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with neighbors 2, 6, 8: <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with neighbors 4, 6, 9: <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with neighbors 0, 5, 7: <6, (0, 5, 7)> 

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
