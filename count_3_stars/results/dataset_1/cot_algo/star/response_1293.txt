Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
Total number of 3-stars: [12]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 9, 6)>, <1, (4, 8, 7)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (9, 8, 6)>, <3, (8, 9, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>
