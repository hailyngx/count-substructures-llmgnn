Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 20 + 20 + 1 = 42.

Therefore, the answer is [42] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
