Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, let's find the 3-stars.

First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
1: 2, 4, 6
2: 1, 7, 8, 9
4: 1, 8
5: 6
6: 1, 5, 8
7: 2
8: 2, 4, 6
9: 2

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars:
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
