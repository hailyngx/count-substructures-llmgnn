Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars formed. <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, and 5 more similar 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars formed. <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, and so on.
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars formed. <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 9, 9)>, <8, (3, 9, 4)>, <8, (3, 9, 9)>, <8, (4, 9, 9)>, and 5 more coming from the combinations.

There are 30 total 3-stars in this 10-node graph. So, the final answer is [30].
