Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 3)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9
