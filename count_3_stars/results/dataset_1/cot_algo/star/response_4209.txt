Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5}

Now, let's check for each node if they have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars.

- Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 qualify as they each have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each qualifying node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 4] = [47] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
