Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
Nodes 0, 4, and 6 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 3-stars each.
Node 1, 2, and 9 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\(4+4+4+1+1+1+4 = 19\)

Therefore, there are 19 3-stars in this graph.
Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 4, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 0, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 4)>
<6, (4, 0, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 1, 9)> 

Therefore, the final result is [19].
