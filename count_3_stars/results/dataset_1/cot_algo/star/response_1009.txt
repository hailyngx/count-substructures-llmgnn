Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 7, 9} => <1, (5, 7, 9)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 8} => <7, (1, 4, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 2, which is represented as [2].
