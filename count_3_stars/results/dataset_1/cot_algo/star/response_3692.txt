Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44

So, the final answer is [44] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>,
<(2, 5, 7)>, <(2, 5, 8)>, <(2, 5, 9)>, <(2, 8, 9)>, <(5, 7, 8)>, <(5, 7, 9)>, <(5, 8, 9)>, <(7, 8, 9)>.
