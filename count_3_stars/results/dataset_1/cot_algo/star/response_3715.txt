Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 12 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are:

<2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 7)>, <2, (6, 9, 7)>, <2, (8, 9, 7)>,  
<6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 7)>, <6, (2, 9, 7)>, <6, (8, 9, 7)>,  
<8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 9, 7)>, <8, (6, 9, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
