Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: No 3-stars (since only 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-stars (since only 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: No 3-stars (since only 2 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars (since only 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: No 3-stars (since only 2 neighbors)
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-stars (since only 2 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 = 18

Unique 3-stars found: <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
