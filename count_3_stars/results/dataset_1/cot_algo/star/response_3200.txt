Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 20 = 25 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [25] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
