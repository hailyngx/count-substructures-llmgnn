Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 2}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {0, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 8}

Now, we'll check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2, which we'll put inside brackets: [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
