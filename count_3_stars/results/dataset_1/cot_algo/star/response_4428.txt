Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives us a total of [12] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
