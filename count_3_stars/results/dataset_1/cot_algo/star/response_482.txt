Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: neighbor is 2
- Node 4: neighbors are 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 2, 4
- Node 8: neighbor is 9
- Node 9: neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
From the above calculation and the combinatorial step, we find:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, and their symmetric equivalents.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up we get: \[ [1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [25] \]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>
