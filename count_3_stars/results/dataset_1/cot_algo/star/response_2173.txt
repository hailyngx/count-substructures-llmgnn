Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list for better visualization:

0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
1: 3, 7, 8, 9
2: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
3: 0, 1, 5
4: 0, 2
5: 0, 2, 3, 9
6: 0, 2
7: 1, 8
8: 0, 1, 7
9: 1, 2, 5

Now, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Neighbors:
0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
1: 3, 7, 8, 9
2: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
3: 0, 1, 5
4: 0, 2
5: 0, 2, 3, 9
6: 0, 2
7: 1, 8
8: 0, 1, 7
9: 1, 2, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 10 = 30.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)> 

So, the final answer is [30].
