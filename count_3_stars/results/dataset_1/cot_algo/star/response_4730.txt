Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 6)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (Nodes 6, 7)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (Nodes 3, 4, 9)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (Nodes 2, 5)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 5, 8)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (Nodes 3, 4, 6)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (Nodes 0, 1, 8, 9)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (Nodes 1, 8, 9)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (Nodes 4, 6, 7)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 6, 7)

Next, we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 6 forms 4 3-stars \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10] with the unique 3-stars being:
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
