Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 3, 5, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors: 3-star formed with nodes 3, 5, 8)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars formed: with nodes 0, 1, 4; 0, 4, 9; 1, 4, 9; 4, 9, 3)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars formed: with nodes 1, 4, 6; 1, 4, 8; 1, 6, 8; 4, 6, 8)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the final result is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (5, 8, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 9, 3)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 8)>.
