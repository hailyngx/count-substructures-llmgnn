Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {2, 3}
Node 1: {2, 6}
Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6}
Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
Node 7: {5, 8}
Node 8: {2, 5, 7}
Node 9: {2, 5}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 8, 9}  <2, (1, 8, 9)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1].
