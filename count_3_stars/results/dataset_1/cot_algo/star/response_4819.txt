Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes are 5.
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes are 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes are 1, 6, 8.
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes are 1, 6, 7.
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes are 1, 9.
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes are 0, 1, 7.
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes are 2, 3.
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes are 3, 5.
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes are 2.
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes are 4.

Now, let's check for 3-stars:
- Node 1: 3-stars formed with node 1 = inom{4}{3} = 4.
- Node 2: 3-stars formed with node 2 = inom{3}{3} = 1.
- Node 3: 3-stars formed with node 3 = inom{3}{3} = 1.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 1] = 6.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 3, 4)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 5)>,
<1, (2, 4, 5)>,
<1, (3, 4, 5)>,
<2, (1, 3, 6)>,
<3, (1, 5, 7)>.
