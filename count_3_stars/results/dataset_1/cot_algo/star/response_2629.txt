Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 7

Since Node 0, Node 3, Node 6, and Node 7 have 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

So, the final answer is [10]. The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>.
