Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 4) 

Response:
To begin, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The possible combinations are: <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>.
- Node 4 also has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. The only combination is: <4, (2, 3, 7)>.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1] = [5]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>.
