Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 8}

Nodes 1 and 7 have 4 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars. Let's calculate them:
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
   - <1, (4, 5, 7)>
   - <1, (5, 7, 4)>
   - <1, (4, 7, 5)>
   - <1, (5, 4, 7)>
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
   - <7, (1, 5, 6)>
   - <7, (1, 6, 5)>
   - <7, (1, 4, 5)>
   - <7, (1, 5, 4)>
   - <7, (1, 4, 6)>
   - <7, (1, 6, 4)>
   - <7, (5, 4, 6)>
   - <7, (5, 6, 4)>
   - <7, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <7, (4, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 10] = 14.
