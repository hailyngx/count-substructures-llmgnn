Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 5, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8
Node 2: 1, 3, 5
Node 3: 1, 2, 9
Node 4: 1, 8
Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 8
Node 6: 5, 7, 9
Node 7: 6
Node 8: 1, 4, 5
Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 9)>
Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 8)>
Node 2 forms 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 3 forms 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4 forms 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 8)>
Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 9)>
Node 7 forms 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 5)>
Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 6, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 6, 3)>
