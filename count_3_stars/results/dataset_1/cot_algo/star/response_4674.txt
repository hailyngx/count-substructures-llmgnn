Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing these up, we have a total of 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 48 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 6)>.
