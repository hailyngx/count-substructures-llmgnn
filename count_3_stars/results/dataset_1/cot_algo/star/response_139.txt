Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {4, 9}
Node 1: {2}
Node 2: {1, 9}
Node 3: {8}
Node 4: {0}
Node 5: {8}
Node 6: {8}
Node 8: {3, 5, 6, 9}
Node 9: {0, 2, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: 0 3-stars formed
Node 2: 1 3-star formed <2, (1, 9, 8)>
Node 8: 1 3-star formed <8, (3, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 9, 8)> and <8, (3, 6, 5)>.
