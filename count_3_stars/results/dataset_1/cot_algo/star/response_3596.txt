Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's denote the nodes as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to node 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10

So, there are 10 3-stars in this graph. Listing them out: 
<[0, 1, 6], [0, 1, 7], [0, 1, 8], [0, 6, 7], [0, 6, 8], [0, 7, 8], [1, 4, 7], [1, 4, 6], [7, 8, 9], [0, 8, 9]>
