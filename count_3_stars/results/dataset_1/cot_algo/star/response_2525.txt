Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we need to find the total number of 3-stars formed and the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is \(10 + 4 + 4 = 18\), which we'll represent as [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>

These are the unique 3-stars present in the graph.
