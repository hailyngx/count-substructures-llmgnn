Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 7}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {8}
- Node 10: {}

Now, let's look at the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: forms 1 3-star
- Node 7: forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: forms 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 7.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (3, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>
