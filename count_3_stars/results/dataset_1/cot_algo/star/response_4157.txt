Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors

Next, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 cannot form a 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <2, (0, 3, 7)>.
