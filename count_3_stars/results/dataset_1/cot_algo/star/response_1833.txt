Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7

Next, identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19

So, the total number of 3-stars is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
