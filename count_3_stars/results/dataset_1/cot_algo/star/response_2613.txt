Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2

Next, let's identify nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 33.

So, the final answer is [33] and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>.
