Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6
- Node 8: 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 7, 9. So, <0, (4, 7, 9)>.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 6, 8, 0. So, <4, (6, 8, 0)>.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 7, 8. So, <6, (4, 7, 8)>.

The total number of 3-stars is 3, so the final answer is [3].
