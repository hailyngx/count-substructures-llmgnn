Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 8

Nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will count the 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: [] (has 3 neighbors only)
- Node 3: [] (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 7: [] (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 8: [1] (has 4 neighbors)

Therefore, there are a total of 1 unique 3-stars:
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>

So, the final answer is [1].
