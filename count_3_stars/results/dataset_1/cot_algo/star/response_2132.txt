Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the information for the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1}

Now we can calculate the 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 8)>
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (5, 7, 8)>
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 3)>, <7, (5, 6, 1)>, <7, (3, 1, 8)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives a final count of [20].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<1, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<1, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<5, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (3, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<5, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<7, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<7, (5, 6, 3)>, 
<7, (5, 6, 1)>, 
<7, (3, 1, 8)>
