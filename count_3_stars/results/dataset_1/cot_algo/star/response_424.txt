Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {5, 8, 9}
Node 1: {3, 4, 7}
Node 2: {4}
Node 3: {1, 6}
Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 7}
Node 5: {0, 4}
Node 6: {3}
Node 7: {1, 4, 9}
Node 8: {0}
Node 9: {0, 7}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 0: 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 1: 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 4: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars (if we composed a 3-star from each neighbor set combination)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 4] = 6. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 7>
<4, 2, 5>
<4, 2, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
