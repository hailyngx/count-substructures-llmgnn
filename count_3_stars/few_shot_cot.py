    A 3-star graph consists of a central node, called the center, which is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 
    This is an example of how you can count the 3-stars in a graph step-by-step applied to each node in the graph: 
    This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
    Adjacency list for each node: 
    Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
    Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
    Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
    Node 3 is connected to node 9
    Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
    Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
    Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
    Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6
    Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
    Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

    To find the total number of 3-stars, we'll apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors. If it has exactly 3 neighbors, thereâ€™s only 1 3-star formed with that node. No 3-star is formed if less than 3 neighbors.  
    Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
    Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
    - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - **Node 8**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
    - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
    Add up all the valid configurations:
    - From Node 0: 4
    - From Node 2: 1
    - From Node 4: 10
    - From Node 5: 1
    - From Node 6: 1
    - From Node 7: 10
    Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 27
    Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
    
    Do exactly as instructed in the example above to find the number of 3-stars in the graph below. Output the final answer inside brackets [].
    List the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once. For example, <1, (2, 4, 5)> represents a 3-star with node 1 as the central node and nodes 2, 4, and 5 as the leaves.
