Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 15) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 1) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 18) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 19) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 17) (15, 13) (15, 19) (4, 0) (4, 19) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 2) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-19-14-3-13-1-18-2-12-10-6-9-11-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-11-9-6-10-12-2-18-1-6-1-13-3-14-17-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-7-17-14-19-4-0
- Cycle 4: 0-7-2-3-14-17-1-13-8-0
- Cycle 5: 1-6-10-12-2-3-13-15-19-7-17-1
- Cycle 6: 1-13-3-2-12-10-6-9-11-5-0-8-13-1
- Cycle 7: 2-3-13-1-18-2
- Cycle 8: 3-2-12-10-6-1-17-15-13-3
- Cycle 9: 3-13-1-17-14-19-4-0-5-11-9-6-1-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

After checking, we find that Cycle 8 has exactly one chord 2-6 <2, 6>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 8 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <2, 6>
