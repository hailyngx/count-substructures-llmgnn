Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 1: (6, 11, 1, 4, 6)
- Cycle 1: (8, 5, 12, 9, 8)
- Cycle 1: (2, 4, 1, 3, 2)
- Cycle 1: (7, 11, 6, 12, 7)
- Cycle 1: (0, 3, 1, 9, 0)
- Cycle 1: (10, 11, 6, 12, 10)
- Cycle 1: (14, 4, 1, 9, 14)
- Cycle 1: (13, 2, 8, 4, 13)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 1, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (6, 11, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 2: (8, 5, 7, 11, 8)
- Cycle 2: (2, 4, 8, 10, 2)
- Cycle 2: (7, 11, 1, 4, 7)
- Cycle 2: (0, 9, 1, 4, 0)
- Cycle 2: (10, 8, 4, 2, 10)
- Cycle 2: (14, 4, 11, 7, 14)
- Cycle 2: (13, 2, 7, 5, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<5, 9, 1, 4> with a chord (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 18 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
