Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 13) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (13, 15) (4, 9) (4, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 6) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 16) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 12) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 9) (6, 18) (6, 11) (10, 19) (10, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 18, 6)
- Cycle 2: (14, 17, 5, 2)
- Cycle 3: (17, 5, 19, 11)
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 3, 15)
- Cycle 5: (1, 8, 9, 4)
- Cycle 6: (8, 9, 12, 14)
- Cycle 7: (13, 15, 18, 6)
- Cycle 8: (11, 14, 19, 16)
- Cycle 9: (16, 5, 17, 0)
- Cycle 10: (16, 19, 11, 6)
- Cycle 11: (7, 1, 8, 3)
- Cycle 12: (7, 1, 8, 9)
- Cycle 13: (7, 2, 5, 17)
- Cycle 14: (7, 2, 5, 19)
- Cycle 15: (7, 10, 19, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <Cycle 1, (3, 18)>
- <Cycle 2, (14, 5)>
- <Cycle 3, (5, 11)>
- <Cycle 4, (8, 15)>
- <Cycle 5, (8, 9)>
- <Cycle 6, (9, 12)>
- <Cycle 7, (13, 18)>
- <Cycle 8, (11, 16)>
- <Cycle 9, (5, 17)>
- <Cycle 10, (16, 11)>
- <Cycle 11, (1, 8)>
- <Cycle 12, (1, 8)>
- <Cycle 13, (2, 17)>
- <Cycle 14, (2, 19)>
- <Cycle 15, (10, 19)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [15].
