Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 3) (26, 17) (15, 23) (15, 2) (15, 25) (27, 29) (27, 21) (27, 5) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 7) (29, 27) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 24) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (23, 15) (23, 2) (23, 1) (0, 22) (0, 18) (20, 19) (20, 28) (28, 29) (28, 20) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 1) (3, 26) (11, 26) (11, 13) (11, 12) (17, 26) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 5) (1, 23) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 6) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 14) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 24) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 22) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 24) (16, 13) (16, 22) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 19) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 16) (14, 10) (14, 24) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 16) (24, 29) (24, 21) (24, 12) (24, 14) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 7) (19, 25) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 19) (5, 27) (5, 17) 

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (9, 8, 7, 2, 15, 23, 1, 18, 9)
- Cycle 2: (26, 10, 12, 17, 26)
- Cycle 3: (15, 23, 1, 6, 8, 7, 2)
- Cycle 4: (27, 5, 17, 12, 24, 29, 27)
- Cycle 5: (2, 15, 23, 1, 18, 9, 19, 20, 28, 29, 27, 21, 25, 19, 7, 2)
- Cycle 6: (8, 9, 19, 7, 2, 29, 28, 20, 19, 9)
- Cycle 7: (23, 15, 2, 29, 27, 21, 25, 19, 7, 8, 6, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<1, (5, 10)>
<2, (1, 17)>
<3, (9, 29)>
<4, (5, 29)>
<5, (15, 9)>
<6, (7, 29)>
<7, (15, 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
