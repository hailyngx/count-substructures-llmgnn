Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-5-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-8-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-6-4-0
- Cycle 4: 1-5-8-3-1
- Cycle 5: 1-0-7-4-1
- Cycle 6: 2-6-4-9-2
- Cycle 7: 3-8-5-7-3
- Cycle 8: 3-0-7-9-3
- Cycle 9: 4-6-2-3-4
- Cycle 10: 4-9-7-5-4
- Cycle 11: 5-8-7-4-5

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <0, 1, 5, 4> has a chord <0, 4> 
- Cycle 2 <0, 3, 8, 7> has a chord <3, 7>
- Cycle 3 <0, 2, 6, 4> has a chord <2, 6>
- Cycle 4 <1, 5, 8, 3> has a chord <5, 8>
- Cycle 5 <1, 0, 7, 4> has a chord <0, 4>
- Cycle 6 <2, 6, 4, 9> has a chord <6, 4>
- Cycle 7 <3, 8, 5, 7> has a chord <8, 5>
- Cycle 8 <3, 0, 7, 9> has a chord <0, 7>
- Cycle 9 <4, 6, 2, 3> has a chord <6, 3>
- Cycle 10 <4, 9, 7, 5> has a chord <9, 7>
- Cycle 11 <5, 8, 7, 4> has a chord <8, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [11] chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
