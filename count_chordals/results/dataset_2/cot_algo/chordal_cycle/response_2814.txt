Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 8, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 2, 4, 3, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 1, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 4, 6, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 8, 4, 3, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 7, 0, 6, 9)
- Cycle 7: (6, 4, 2, 7, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 1, 0, 7, 6)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 2, 6, 0, 4)
- Cycle 11: (8, 2, 7, 0, 8)
- Cycle 12: (8, 1, 0, 7, 8)
- Cycle 13: (2, 7, 0, 1, 2)
- Cycle 14: (0, 6, 4, 8, 0)
- Cycle 15: (7, 9, 8, 2, 7)
- Cycle 16: (1, 5, 3, 4, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (2, 4)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (3, 4)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (8, 4)
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: (2, 7)
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord: (1, 0)
- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord: (7, 4)
- Cycle 10 has exactly one chord: (6, 0)
- Cycle 11 has exactly one chord: (2, 0)
- Cycle 12 has exactly one chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 13 has exactly one chord: (0, 2)
- Cycle 14 has exactly one chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 15 has exactly one chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 16 has exactly one chord: (5, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

There are 16 chordal cycles found, so the number of chordless cycles is [16].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, (9, 2), 8>.
