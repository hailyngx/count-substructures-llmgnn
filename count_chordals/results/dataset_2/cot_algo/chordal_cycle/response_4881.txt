Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (12, 9) (12, 7) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 10, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (7, 4, 0, 6, 7)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 9, 8, 10, 3)
- Cycle 5: (13, 4, 0, 11, 13)
- Cycle 6: (14, 4, 7, 12, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 3)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 0)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (5, 2)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (9, 8)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (4, 11)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
