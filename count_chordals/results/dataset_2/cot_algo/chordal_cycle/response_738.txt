Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 15) (5, 16) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (19, 1) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 9) (15, 18) (15, 9) (15, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 14) (14, 18) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 1) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 0) (7, 1) (9, 10) (9, 15) (9, 13) (1, 19) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.

Step 2:
- No chordal 4-cycles found.

Step 3:
- The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
