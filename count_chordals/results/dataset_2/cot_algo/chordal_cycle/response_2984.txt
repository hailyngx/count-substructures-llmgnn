Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 6) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 15) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 13) (1, 26) (1, 2) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 22) (26, 1) (26, 10) (26, 27) (26, 4) (21, 8) (21, 18) (28, 16) (28, 13) (28, 23) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 25) (5, 4) (13, 15) (13, 28) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (25, 5) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 2) (27, 26) (27, 25) (27, 23) (19, 14) (19, 12) (22, 17) (22, 14) (22, 0) (29, 10) (29, 25) (29, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 25) (7, 15) (7, 29) (7, 9) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 22) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 14) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (20, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 26) (4, 5) (0, 22) (0, 12) (0, 8) (18, 21) (18, 13) (18, 20) (23, 28) (23, 27) (8, 11) (8, 21) (8, 12) (8, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <1, 26, 4, 5>
2. <1, 2, 5, 25>
3. <1, 26, 27, 25>
4. <3, 6, 11, 14>
5. <3, 6, 14, 22>
6. <3, 14, 22, 0>
7. <6, 14, 22, 0>
8. <12, 0, 8, 21>
9. <12, 0, 22, 14>

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, the chordal cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, 26, 4, 5> with chord (1, 5)
- <1, 2, 5, 25> with chord (1, 25)
- <3, 6, 11, 14> with chord (6, 14)
- <3, 14, 22, 0> with chord (14, 22)
- <6, 14, 22, 0> with chord (6, 22)
- <12, 0, 8, 21> with chord (0, 8)

The chordless cycles found are:
- <1, 26, 27, 25>
- <3, 6, 14, 22>
- <12, 0, 22, 14>

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
