Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 4) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-10-1
- Cycle 2: 3-10-11-3
- Cycle 3: 3-8-13-3
- Cycle 4: 3-2-10-3
- Cycle 5: 8-13-1-8
- Cycle 6: 13-5-12-13
- Cycle 7: 5-6-3-5
- Cycle 8: 5-14-11-5
- Cycle 9: 6-0-9-6
- Cycle 10: 7-13-12-7
- Cycle 11: 12-5-14-12
- Cycle 12: 0-9-10-0
- Cycle 13: 9-7-2-9
- Cycle 14: 4-1-13-4
- Cycle 15: 2-3-14-2

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (3, 10), 1> with chord (3, 10)
- <3, (10, 11), 3> with chord (10, 11)
- <3, (8, 13), 3> with chord (8, 13)
- <3, (2, 10), 3> with chord (2, 10)
- <8, (13, 1), 8> with chord (13, 1)
- <13, (5, 12), 13> with chord (5, 12)
- <5, (6, 3), 5> with chord (6, 3)
- <5, (14, 11), 5> with chord (14, 11)
- <6, (0, 9), 6> with chord (0, 9)
- <7, (13, 12), 7> with chord (13, 12)
- <12, (5, 14), 12> with chord (5, 14)
- <0, (9, 10), 0> with chord (9, 10)
- <9, (7, 2), 9> with chord (7, 2)
- <4, (1, 13), 4> with chord (1, 13)
- <2, (3, 14), 2> with chord (3, 14)

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles found
The number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [15].
