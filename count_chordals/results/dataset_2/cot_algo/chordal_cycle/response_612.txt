This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 10) (0, 18) (0, 5) (10, 4) (10, 18) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 18) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 6) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 15) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 19) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 0)

        - Cycle 20: <7, 14, 13, 6>
        - Cycle 21: <7, 14, 3, 11>
        - Cycle 22: <7, 13, 6, 8>
        - Cycle 23: <7, 1, 2, 8>
        - Cycle 24: <12, 9, 18, 0>
        - Cycle 25: <18, 0, 5, 11>
        - Cycle 26: <18, 10, 4, 2>
        - Cycle 27: <18, 10, 4, 0>
        - Cycle 28: <18, 19, 15, 16>
        - Cycle 29: <18, 19, 3, 11>
        - Cycle 30: <18, 9, 11, 3>
        - Cycle 31: <19, 3, 14, 17>
        - Cycle 32: <19, 3, 11, 5>
        - Cycle 33: <19, 15, 16, 15>
        - Cycle 34: <19, 15, 6, 13>
        - Cycle 35: <19, 1, 2, 8>
        - Cycle 36: <9, 11, 5, 0>
        - Cycle 37: <9, 11, 3, 14>
        - Cycle 38: <9, 18, 19, 15>
        - Cycle 39: <15, 16, 15, 19>
        - Cycle 40: <15, 16, 15, 6>
        - Cycle 41: <15, 19, 18, 10>
        - Cycle 42: <6, 15, 19, 18>
        - Cycle 43: <1, 11, 5, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

        - <11, 3, 14, 7> has a chord (14, 13): <11, 14, 13, 7>
        - <11, 3, 19, 1> has a chord (3, 14): <11, 3, 14, 1>
        - <11, 5, 14, 7> has a chord (11, 3): <3, 14, 5, 7>
        - <11, 5, 14, 13> has a chord (11, 3): <11, 3, 14, 13>
        - <16, 15, 6, 13> has a chord (6, 8): <16, 6, 13, 15>
        - <14, 17, 18, 0> has a chord (17, 14): <17, 18, 14, 0>
        - <14, 3, 19, 1> has a chord (14, 5): <14, 5, 19, 1>
        - <14, 13, 6, 8> has a chord (13, 14): <13, 6, 14, 8>
        - <17, 14, 3, 11> has a chord (17, 18): <17, 3, 11, 14>
        - <13, 7, 1, 2> has a chord (7, 14): <13, 7, 14, 1>
        - <18, 9, 11, 3> has a chord (9, 18): <9, 11, 18, 3>
        - <19, 3, 14, 17> has a chord (3, 11): <19, 3, 11, 17>
        - <6, 15, 19, 18> has a chord (15, 16): <6, 15, 16, 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

        There are 13 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13].
