Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 26) (21, 25) (2, 23) (2, 10) (29, 16) (29, 25) (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 20) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 5) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 23) (20, 3) (20, 7) (20, 22) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 12) (28, 13) (26, 21) (26, 28) (26, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 27) (25, 21) (25, 29) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (12, 28) (12, 8) (12, 11) (19, 4) (19, 6) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 24) (11, 4) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 24) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 24) (6, 27) (6, 19) (7, 1) (7, 20) (7, 26) (7, 14) (7, 5) (24, 3) (24, 22) (24, 14) (24, 10) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 10) (16, 29) (16, 22) (16, 23) (23, 2) (23, 0) (23, 16) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 28) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 1-21-28-26-1
- Cycle 2: 1-21-27-9-6-27-1
- Cycle 3: 1-21-25-29-16-22-20-3-15-13-1
- Cycle 4: 1-21-25-29-16-22-24-14-7-1
- Cycle 5: 1-21-26-7-20-3-15-13-1
- Cycle 6: 1-21-26-7-14-24-3-20-1
- Cycle 7: 1-21-26-7-5-15-13-1
- Cycle 8: 1-21-26-7-5-17-0-18-15-13-1
- Cycle 9: 1-21-26-7-5-17-0-23-2-10-3-20-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Only Cycle 1: 1-21-28-26-1 has exactly one chord 28-26.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <1, (28, 26), 21, 1>.
