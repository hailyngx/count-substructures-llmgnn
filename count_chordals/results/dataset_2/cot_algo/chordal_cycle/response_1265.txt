This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 8) (15, 27) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 15) (27, 16) (27, 23) (25, 3) (25, 15) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 16) (26, 19) (26, 8) (26, 7) (19, 26) (19, 24) (19, 6) (19, 9) (24, 19) (24, 14) (24, 2) (7, 26) (7, 20) (7, 23) (7, 2) (13, 4) (13, 29) (13, 0) (17, 0) (17, 12) (4, 13) (4, 22) (4, 5) (12, 17) (12, 20) (6, 1) (6, 19) (6, 11) (22, 4) (22, 16) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 24) (14, 11) (14, 20) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 5) (21, 29) (2, 1) (2, 24) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 28) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 14) (0, 13) (0, 17) (0, 21) (9, 19) (9, 21) (9, 2) (9, 10) (16, 27) (16, 1) (16, 22) (16, 29) (18, 10) (18, 29) (5, 4) (5, 21) (5, 10) (29, 15) (29, 13) (29, 21) (29, 16) (29, 18) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 28) (8, 3) (8, 26) (28, 2) (28, 10) (23, 27) (23, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <1, 6, 19, 24, 2, 7>
2. <1, 6, 19, 26, 7, 2>
3. <1, 16, 27, 15, 25, 3>
4. <2, 7, 26, 19, 6, 1>
5. <2, 7, 26, 19, 24, 2>
6. <2, 24, 19, 6, 1, 16>
7. <4, 13, 29, 21, 5, 10>
8. <5, 10, 9, 19, 6, 11>
9. <5, 10, 9, 21, 29, 13>
10. <5, 21, 29, 13, 4, 22>
11. <6, 1, 16, 27, 15, 25>
12. <7, 2, 24, 19, 26, 8>
13. <7, 26, 8, 3, 25, 15>
14. <9, 10, 5, 21, 29, 18>
15. <10, 5, 21, 0, 17, 12>
16. <16, 1, 6, 19, 26, 7>
17. <16, 1, 6, 11, 14, 24>
18. <16, 27, 23, 7, 2, 24>
19. <19, 6, 1, 2, 7, 26>
20. <19, 9, 10, 5, 21, 29>
21. <19, 24, 2, 7, 26, 8>
22. <21, 0, 17, 12, 20, 7>
23. <21, 5, 4, 13, 29, 18>
24. <24, 19, 26, 8, 3, 25>
25. <24, 2, 7, 26, 19, 6>
26. <26, 8, 3, 25, 15, 27>
27. <26, 19, 6, 1, 16, 22>
28. <27, 15, 25, 3, 8, 26>
29. <29, 15, 27, 23, 7, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <16, 1, 6, 19, 26, 7> has a chord (6, 26)
- <5, 10, 9, 21, 29, 13> has a chord (9, 29)
- <7, 2, 24, 19, 26, 8> has a chord (19, 8)
- <9, 10, 5, 21, 29, 18> has a chord (5, 29)
- <16, 1, 6, 11, 14, 24> has a chord (6, 24)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [24]
