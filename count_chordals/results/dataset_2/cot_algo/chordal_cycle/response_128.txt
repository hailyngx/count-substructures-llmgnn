Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 3, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 1, 3, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 6, 3, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 3, 8, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 9, 8, 3, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 5, 4, 6, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 5, 7, 3, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 8, 3, 6, 9)
- Cycle 10: (6, 2, 1, 4, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 3, 1, 2, 6)
- Cycle 12: (1, 3, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 13: (1, 4, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 14: (1, 4, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 15: (3, 5, 7, 2, 3)
- Cycle 16: (3, 6, 4, 1, 3)
- Cycle 17: (4, 1, 3, 6, 4)
- Cycle 18: (4, 2, 1, 3, 4)
- Cycle 19: (8, 2, 1, 4, 8)
- Cycle 20: (8, 3, 1, 2, 8)
- Cycle 21: (2, 6, 3, 1, 2)
- Cycle 22: (2, 7, 3, 8, 2)
- Cycle 23: (2, 8, 9, 5, 2)
- Cycle 24: (0, 1, 3, 7, 0)
- Cycle 25: (0, 7, 2, 6, 0)
- Cycle 26: (7, 2, 8, 9, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, (3, 1), 4, 5>
- <5, (4, 1), 3, 5>
- <5, (7, 3), 8, 5>
- <5, (9, 8), 3, 5>
- <9, (5, 4), 6, 9>
- <9, (5, 7), 3, 9>
- <9, (8, 3), 6, 9>
- <6, (2, 1), 4, 6>
- <6, (3, 1), 2, 6>
- <1, (3, 7), 0, 1>
- <1, (4, 2), 6, 1>
- <3, (5, 7), 2, 3>
- <7, (3, 8), 2, 7>
- <8, (2, 1), 4, 8>
- <2, (6, 3), 1, 2>
- <0, (1, 3), 7, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [16]
