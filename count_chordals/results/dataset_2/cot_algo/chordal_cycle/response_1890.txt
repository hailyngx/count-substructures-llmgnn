Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 2) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 19) (10, 11) (10, 7) (2, 15) (2, 8) (18, 14) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 17) (5, 16) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 17) (17, 12) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 9) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 15) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 9) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 19) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 15, 2, 8, 4, 12, 11, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 11, 12, 4, 9, 19, 14, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 19, 9, 7, 10, 11, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 11, 12, 7, 10, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 0, 16, 5, 13, 17, 6, 1, 3)
- Cycle 6: (9, 19, 14, 18, 3, 0, 15, 2, 8, 4, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Checking Cycle 1: (1, 3, 15, 2, 8, 4, 12, 11, 1) has chord (4, 11)
- Checking Cycle 2: (1, 11, 12, 4, 9, 19, 14, 3, 1) has chord (12, 3)
- Checking Cycle 3: (1, 19, 9, 7, 10, 11, 1) has chord (9, 11)
- Checking Cycle 4: (3, 1, 11, 12, 7, 10, 3) has chord (1, 10)
- Checking Cycle 5: (3, 0, 16, 5, 13, 17, 6, 1, 3) has chord (0, 5)
- Checking Cycle 6: (9, 19, 14, 18, 3, 0, 15, 2, 8, 4, 9) has chord (14, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, 3, 15, 2, 8, (4, 11), 12, 11>
- <1, 11, 12, 4, 9, (12, 3), 19, 14>
- <1, 19, 9, 7, 10, (9, 11), 11, 1>
- <3, 1, 11, 12, 7, (1, 10), 10, 3>
- <3, 0, 16, 5, 13, (0, 5), 17, 6>
- <9, 19, 14, 18, 3, 0, 15, 2, 8, (14, 8), 4, 9>
