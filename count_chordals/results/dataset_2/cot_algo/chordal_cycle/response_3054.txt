Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (15, 16) (15, 0) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (18, 19) (18, 12) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 5) (0, 15) (0, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 7) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 9) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 10) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 9) (9, 16) (9, 19) (9, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Possible cycles in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: 11-16-15-0-11
- Cycle 2: 11-14-12-18-19-11
- Cycle 3: 11-14-17-1-7-12-11
- Cycle 4: 16-15-0-5-7-16
- Cycle 5: 16-15-0-5-12-14-17-16
- Cycle 6: 16-7-12-14-11-16
- Cycle 7: 16-7-12-18-19-11-16
- Cycle 8: 3-2-4-6-13-5-3
- Cycle 9: 3-2-4-10-6-13-5-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (12, 18), 17, 14>
- <2, (12, 18), 14, 17>
- <3, (5, 0), 15, 16>
- <3, (5, 12), 14, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
