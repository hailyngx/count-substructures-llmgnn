Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (16, 17) (16, 2) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 10) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (19, 5) (19, 1) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 17) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 13) (12, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1-11-6-9-1
- Cycle 2: 1-11-7-4-2-16-17-13-10-3-1
- Cycle 3: 1-11-7-4-10-3-15-2-16-17-13-1
- Cycle 4: 1-11-7-4-10-13-17-16-2-15-3-1
- Cycle 5: 1-11-7-4-2-16-17-13-9-6-1
- Cycle 6: 1-11-7-5-19-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 9) -> <1, (1, 9), 6>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (16, 10) -> <2, (16, 10), 1>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (13, 17) -> <3, (13, 17), 10>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (2, 13) -> <4, (2, 13), 7>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (4, 9) -> <5, (4, 9), 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

Since we found 5 chordal 4-cycles, the final number is [5].
