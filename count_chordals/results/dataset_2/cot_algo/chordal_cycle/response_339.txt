Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.

Step 2: 
- There are no chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Step 3: 
- The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].
