Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 2) (16, 10) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 18) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 17) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 5) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 19) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 18) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 14) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 1) (9, 18) (9, 2) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 9) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 10 - 16 - 2 - 9 - 10
- Cycle 2: 17 - 15 - 1 - 6 - 17
- Cycle 3: 10 - 17 - 0 - 5 - 10
- Cycle 4: 10 - 17 - 19 - 14 - 10
- Cycle 5: 10 - 17 - 19 - 12 - 10
- Cycle 6: 16 - 2 - 9 - 18 - 16
- Cycle 7: 16 - 2 - 0 - 17 - 16

Step 2:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (10, 2)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 17)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (17, 5)
- Cycle 4 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 5 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 6 has a chord (2, 18)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (2, 17)

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord, so the final answer is [3].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <10, 16, (2, 9), 10>
2. <17, 15, (1, 6), 17>
3. <16, 2, (9, 18), 16>
