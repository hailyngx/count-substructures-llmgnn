The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 28) (17, 0) (3, 25) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 18) (4, 11) (8, 29) (8, 0) (28, 17) (28, 0) (28, 12) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 12) (6, 14) (6, 22) (6, 18) (6, 13) (15, 20) (15, 7) (15, 24) (20, 29) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 2) (2, 20) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 11) (18, 25) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 7) (10, 14) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 13) (22, 6) (23, 5) (23, 13) (26, 3) (26, 25) (26, 27) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 24) (16, 19) (16, 27) (24, 15) (24, 16) (24, 5) (5, 23) (5, 24) (9, 25) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 0) (12, 28) (12, 29) (12, 20) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 19) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 16) (11, 4) (11, 2) (19, 10) (19, 16) (19, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 21) (13, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 8, 29, 20, 2, 1, 10, 14)
- Cycle 2: (0, 8, 29, 20, 12, 28, 17, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 10, 14, 6, 18, 25, 3, 26, 27, 16, 24, 15, 7, 19, 16)
- Cycle 4: (0, 1, 2, 18, 25, 9, 7, 19, 16, 27, 26, 3, 25)
- Cycle 5: (0, 1, 2, 11, 4, 11, 2, 18, 25, 26, 3, 25)
- Cycle 6: (1, 0, 8, 29, 20, 12, 28, 17, 0)
- Cycle 7: (1, 2, 18, 25, 9, 7, 15, 24, 16, 27, 26, 3, 25)
- Cycle 8: (1, 10, 14, 6, 18, 2, 20, 15, 7, 19, 16, 27, 26, 3, 25, 18)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (29, 20)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (29, 20)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (10, 14)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (18, 25)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (2, 18)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (29, 20)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (7, 15)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (10, 14)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (29, 20), 14)>
<2, (29, 20), 8)>
<3, (10, 14), 1)>
<4, (18, 25), 2)>
<5, (2, 18), 1)>
<6, (29, 20), 0)>
<7, (7, 15), 1)>
<8, (10, 14), 1)>
