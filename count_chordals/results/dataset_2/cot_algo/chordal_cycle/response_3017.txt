Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 12) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 19) (10, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 19) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (5, 1) (5, 19) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 4) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 5) (8, 15) (8, 12) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 4) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 8) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <1, 3, 15, 12>
2. Cycle <1, 14, 9, 6>
3. Cycle <1, 14, 0, 19>
4. Cycle <1, 14, 11, 7>
5. Cycle <2, 16, 13, 4>
6. Cycle <4, 13, 16, 0>
7. Cycle <4, 16, 2, 11>
8. Cycle <6, 12, 15, 8>
9. Cycle <6, 15, 3, 1>
10. Cycle <6, 15, 12, 13>
11. Cycle <6, 9, 14, 1>
12. Cycle <7, 11, 2, 16>
13. Cycle <9, 14, 1, 5>
14. Cycle <10, 9, 14, 1>
15. Cycle <11, 2, 16, 0>
16. Cycle <11, 14, 1, 5>
17. Cycle <12, 6, 9, 14>
18. Cycle <12, 8, 15, 3>
19. Cycle <13, 16, 2, 11>
20. Cycle <14, 11, 2, 16>
21. Cycle <15, 3, 1, 14>
22. Cycle <15, 6, 12, 13>
23. Cycle <16, 2, 11, 7>
24. Cycle <16, 4, 13, 12>
25. Cycle <16, 13, 12, 8>
26. Cycle <18, 17, 4, 13>
27. Cycle <19, 1, 14, 11>
28. Cycle <19, 1, 5, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 3, 15, 12> with chord (3, 15)
2. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 14, 9, 6> with chord (14, 9)
3. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 14, 0, 19> with chord (14, 19)
4. Chordal 4-cycle <2, 16, 13, 4> with chord (16, 13)
5. Chordal 4-cycle <4, 13, 16, 0> with chord (13, 16)
6. Chordal 4-cycle <6, 12, 15, 8> with chord (12, 15)
7. Chordal 4-cycle <9, 14, 1, 5> with chord (14, 1)
8. Chordal 4-cycle <10, 9, 14, 1> with chord (9, 14)
9. Chordal 4-cycle <11, 2, 16, 0> with chord (2, 16)
10. Chordal 4-cycle <15, 3, 1, 14> with chord (3, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 28 cycles in total, and 10 of them are chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 28 - 10 = [18].
