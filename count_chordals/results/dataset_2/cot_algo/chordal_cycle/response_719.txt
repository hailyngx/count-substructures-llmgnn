Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle: 0-9-2-6-0
2. Cycle: 0-9-2-1-0
3. Cycle: 0-9-8-2-0
4. Cycle: 0-9-8-3-0
5. Cycle: 0-4-1-6-0
6. Cycle: 0-4-1-2-0
7. Cycle: 0-4-2-6-0
8. Cycle: 0-4-3-8-0
9. Cycle: 1-2-6-1
10. Cycle: 1-2-8-1
11. Cycle: 2-4-8-2
12. Cycle: 2-6-4-2
13. Cycle: 3-4-8-3
14. Cycle: 3-8-9-3
15. Cycle: 4-7-6-4
16. Cycle: 7-6-2-7
17. Cycle: 9-8-2-9

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. Cycle: <0, 9, 2, 6, 0> Chord: (2, 6)
2. Cycle: <0, 4, 2, 6, 0> Chord: (2, 6)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [2].
