Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-1-7-3-6-9-0
- Cycle 2: 2-6-9-14-13-2
- Cycle 3: 2-6-3-11-10-2
- Cycle 4: 2-13-14-7-3-2
- Cycle 5: 4-1-7-11-3-4
- Cycle 6: 5-9-6-3-2-12-5
- Cycle 7: 8-4-0-12-14-8

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 7, (4, 0)>
- <2, (6, 14), 9>
- <2, 3, (6, 10)>
- <2, (13, 7), 14>
- <1, 7, (3, 11)>
- <5, (9, 12), 6>
- <0, 4, (8, 12)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [7] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
