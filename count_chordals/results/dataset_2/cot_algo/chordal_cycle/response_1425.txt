Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-7-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-3-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-7-6-0
- Cycle 4: 0-5-7-2-0
- Cycle 45: 0-9-4-6-0
- Cycle 6: 0-9-4-2-0
- Cycle 7: 0-9-4-1-0
- Cycle 8: 0-8-7-6-0
- Cycle 9: 0-8-7-2-0
- Cycle 10: 0-8-2-4-0
- Cycle 11: 0-8-2-6-0
- Cycle 12: 0-8-2-3-0

Step 2:  
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (5, 3)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (5, 2)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (6, 4)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (4, 2)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (7, 2)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (4, 2)
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: (4, 3)

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:  
There are 12 cycles with exactly one chord, so the answer is [12].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 5, 7, 8>
- <0, 5, 3, 7>
- <0, 5, 7, 6>
- <0, 5, 7, 2>
- <0, 9, 4, 6>
- <0, 9, 4, 2>
- <0, 9, 4, 1>
- <0, 8, 7, 6>
- <0, 8, 7, 2>
- <0, 8, 2, 4>
- <0, 8, 2, 6>
- <0, 8, 2, 3>
