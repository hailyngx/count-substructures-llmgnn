Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 23) (26, 27) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 8) (15, 5) (27, 26) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 1) (4, 13) (4, 29) (7, 29) (7, 5) (1, 27) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 17) (3, 10) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 21) (25, 18) (25, 24) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 8) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 24) (18, 25) (18, 5) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 21) (28, 11) (28, 19) (12, 25) (12, 6) (12, 22) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 19) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 23) (19, 22) (19, 16) (22, 27) (22, 12) (22, 19) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 6) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 29) (6, 14) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 24) (14, 16) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 18) (13, 4) (13, 1) (16, 19) (16, 14) (16, 8) (8, 15) (8, 20) (8, 17) (8, 16) (0, 1) (0, 17) (24, 25) (24, 2) (24, 14) (21, 25) (21, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 7, 29, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (8, 17, 1, 27, 26, 25, 18, 8)
- Cycle 3: (8, 16, 14, 24, 25, 20, 11, 8)
- Cycle 4: (12, 22, 27, 26, 25, 21, 11, 12)
- Cycle 5: (12, 25, 20, 11, 28, 19, 22, 12)
- Cycle 6: (14, 16, 8, 20, 25, 24, 14)
- Cycle 7: (14, 16, 19, 28, 11, 21, 25, 24, 14)
- Cycle 8: (15, 23, 19, 28, 11, 20, 8, 15)
- Cycle 9: (15, 23, 19, 22, 27, 1, 17, 8, 15)
- Cycle 10: (15, 27, 22, 27, 26, 25, 20, 15)
- Cycle 11: (15, 27, 1, 17, 3, 10, 14, 16, 8, 15)
- Cycle 12: (19, 23, 9, 15, 8, 20, 11, 28, 19)
- Cycle 13: (19, 22, 27, 26, 25, 21, 11, 20, 19)
- Cycle 14: (19, 28, 11, 20, 25, 18, 5, 7, 29, 6, 19)
- Cycle 15: (23, 19, 2, 24, 25, 20, 8, 15, 23)
- Cycle 16: (24, 14, 10, 3, 17, 1, 13, 4, 29, 6, 24)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (27, 26), 25, 20>
- <2, (24, 25), 20, 11>
- <14, (16, 8), 20, 25>
- <22, (27, 26), 25, 21>
- <12, (22, 27), 26, 25>
- <19, (28, 11), 20, 25>
- <16, (14, 24), 25, 20>
- <15, (23, 19), 28, 11>
- <23, (19, 22), 27, 1>
- <24, (10, 3), 17, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 10 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, therefore the final count is [10].
