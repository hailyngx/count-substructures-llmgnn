Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges are:
1. Cycle 1-2-5-10-7-13-4-2
2. Cycle 1-2-5-14-6-8-11-9-5

Step 2: 
Checking for the cycles found in step 1 for exactly one chord:
1. The cycle 1-2-5-10-7-13-4-2 has a chord (7, 4).
2. The cycle 1-2-5-14-6-8-11-9-5 has a chord (6, 11).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, 2, 5, 10> with chord (7, 4)
<1, 2, 5, 14> with chord (6, 11)
