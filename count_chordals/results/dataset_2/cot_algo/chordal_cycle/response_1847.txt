Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (8, 10) (8, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 11) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, but we will focus on the cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 12 - 2 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 2: 7 - 0 - 2 - 12 - 7
- Cycle 3: 9 - 12 - 2 - 0 - 9
- Cycle 4: 10 - 13 - 7 - 1 - 10
- Cycle 5: 4 - 13 - 7 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 6: 3 - 8 - 10 - 13 - 3
- Cycle 7: 11 - 1 - 7 - 14 - 11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

After analyzing the cycles, we find that Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (0, 2). 
After analyzing the cycles, we find that Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (5, 7).
After analyzing the cycles, we find that Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (0, 2). 
After analyzing the cycles, we find that Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (1, 10).
After analyzing the cycles, we find that Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (0, 7).
After analyzing the cycles, we find that Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (8, 13).
After analyzing the cycles, we find that Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: (1, 14).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since we found 0 chordless cycles, the final answer is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (0, 2), 5>
- <2, (5, 7), 12>
- <3, (0, 2), 9>
- <4, (1, 10), 7>
- <5, (0, 7), 4>
- <6, (8, 13), 10>
- <7, (1, 14), 11>
