Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 5) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <4, 9, 7, 11, 4>
- Cycle <4, 10, 11, 7, 4>
- Cycle <4, 5, 2, 13, 4>
- Cycle <7, 11, 3, 6, 7>
- Cycle <7, 9, 14, 12, 7>
- Cycle <10, 11, 3, 6, 10>
- Cycle <11, 8, 13, 2, 11>
- Cycle <8, 9, 3, 6, 8>
- Cycle <13, 2, 1, 6, 13>
- Cycle <3, 6, 1, 2, 3>
- Cycle <5, 2, 13, 8, 5>
- Cycle <14, 7, 11, 0, 14>
- Cycle <0, 13, 8, 6, 0>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord:
- <4, (5, 9), 10>
- <10, (4, 11), 7>
- <11, (7, 3), 10>
- <7, (9, 14), 11>
- <8, (9, 13), 11>
- <13, (2, 0), 8>
- <3, (6, 9), 11>
- <6, (1, 8), 3>
- <2, (1, 12), 13>
- <1, (5, 6), 2>
- <5, (2, 12), 14>
- <14, (7, 12), 9>
- <0, (6, 12), 13>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13].
