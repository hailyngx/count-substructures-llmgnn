Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 8) (16, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 17) (1, 15) (1, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 18) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 14) (8, 16) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 17) (17, 7) (17, 15) (17, 5) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 15) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 1) (19, 12) (19, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 18) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 5) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 19) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 9) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 19) (9, 13) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- <0, 12, 8, 6, 15, 1, 2, 7, 17, 5>  
- <0, 12, 8, 4, 3, 11, 2, 1, 15, 6>  
- <0, 12, 8, 16, 6, 15, 1, 2, 7, 17>  
- <0, 12, 8, 18, 5, 17, 7, 2, 1, 15>  
- <9, 10, 14, 13, 7, 17, 5, 11, 3, 4>  
- <9, 10, 14, 13, 7, 2, 1, 15, 6, 16>  
- <9, 10, 11, 3, 4, 8, 16, 6, 15, 1>  
- <9, 10, 11, 3, 18, 5, 17, 7, 2, 1>  
- <9, 10, 14, 13, 9, 0, 12, 8, 4, 3>  
- <9, 10, 14, 13, 9, 0, 5, 17, 7, 13>  

Step 2:  
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:  
- <9, 10, 14, 13> (7, 17)  
- <9, 10, 11, 3> (8, 16)  
- <0, 12, 8, 4> (3, 11)  
- <0, 12, 8, 18> (5, 17)  

Step 3:  
Total number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]
