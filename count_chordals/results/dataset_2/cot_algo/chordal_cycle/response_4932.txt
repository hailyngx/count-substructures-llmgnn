Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<5, 1, 3, 2>
<5, 1, 14, 10>
<5, 1, 14, 8>
<5, 1, 14, 6>
<5, 9, 11, 10>
<5, 9, 11, 12>
<5, 9, 13, 10>
<5, 9, 13, 8>
<5, 9, 13, 12>
<5, 6, 7, 4>
<5, 6, 7, 12>
<5, 6, 7, 2>
<5, 6, 7, 2, 4>
<5, 6, 7, 12, 4>
<5, 6, 7, 12, 8>
<9, 13, 10, 11>
<9, 13, 10, 14>
<9, 13, 8, 14>
<4, 8, 13, 9>
<4, 8, 13, 10>
<4, 8, 14, 10>
<4, 8, 14, 1>
<4, 8, 14, 6>
<7, 12, 11, 10>
<7, 12, 11, 5>
<7, 12, 4, 8>
<7, 12, 4, 2>
<7, 2, 4, 8>
<7, 2, 4, 12>
<7, 2, 6, 5>
<1, 14, 10, 11>
<1, 14, 10, 6>
<1, 14, 8, 13>
<1, 14, 8, 4>
<1, 14, 6, 10>
<3, 2, 4, 8>
<3, 2, 4, 7>
<3, 2, 6, 5>
<10, 11, 12, 4>
<10, 11, 5, 9>
<10, 11, 5, 6>
<11, 12, 4, 8>
<11, 12, 4, 7>
<11, 12, 7, 6>
<8, 13, 9, 5>
<8, 13, 9, 11>
<8, 13, 10, 11>
<8, 13, 10, 14>
<8, 12, 7, 6>
<13, 9, 5, 6>
<13, 9, 5, 1>
<13, 10, 11, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<5, 1, 14, 6> (Chord: 1-14)
<5, 9, 11, 10> (Chord: 9-11)
<5, 6, 7, 2> (Chord: 6-7)
<9, 13, 10, 14> (Chord: 13-10)
<4, 8, 13, 9> (Chord: 8-9)
<7, 12, 11, 10> (Chord: 12-11)
<3, 2, 6, 5> (Chord: 2-6)
<11, 5, 9, 13> (Chord: 5-9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [8].
