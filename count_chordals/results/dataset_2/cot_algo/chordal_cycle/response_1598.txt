Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 4) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 28) (14, 17) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 27) (17, 11) (18, 22) (18, 5) (18, 29) (12, 27) (12, 29) (12, 8) (27, 17) (27, 12) (4, 22) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 24) (8, 12) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 28) (6, 11) (28, 15) (28, 6) (5, 17) (5, 18) (5, 19) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 9) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 9) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 21) (10, 19) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 7) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 23) (2, 16) (7, 10) (7, 25) (7, 26) (25, 7) (0, 10) (0, 23) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 20) (11, 13) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 26) (20, 1) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 26) (23, 2) (23, 0) (26, 7) (26, 11) (26, 16) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 12) (24, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

    - Cycle 1: (3, 15, 19, 5, 18, 22, 13, 11, 17, 27, 12, 8, 4, 3)
    - Cycle 2: (4, 3, 15, 19, 10, 7, 26, 11, 17, 5, 18, 22, 2, 16, 26)
    - Cycle 3: (11, 17, 5, 18, 22, 13, 29, 12, 27, 17)
    - Cycle 4: (12, 27, 17, 11, 6, 8, 4, 22, 18, 5, 19, 15, 3, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

    - In Cycle 1, a chord can be added between vertices 15 and 5.
    - In Cycle 2, a chord can be added between vertices 15 and 26.
    - In Cycle 3, a chord can be added between vertices 13 and 12.
    - In Cycle 4, a chord can be added between vertices 27 and 3.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
    
    - The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
    
    - <3, 15, 19, 5>
    - <3, 4, 8, 12, 27>
    - <5, 17, 11, 6>
