Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 6) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 19) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 15) (1, 5) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (15, 19) (15, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 17) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 14) (16, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are two cycles of length 4: (5, 3, 4, 7) and (3, 2, 6, 8).
- There are two cycles of length 5: (5, 3, 2, 6, 8) and (3, 4, 7, 10, 1).

Step 2:
- The cycle (5, 3, 4, 7) has a chord: (3, 7). 
- The cycle (3, 2, 6, 8) has no chords.
- The cycle (5, 3, 2, 6, 8) has no chords.
- The cycle (3, 4, 7, 10, 1) has a chord: (4, 10).

Step 3: 
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, (3, 7), 4>.
- The final number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1].
