Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 8) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 10) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 0) (5, 14) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 19) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 19) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 19) (12, 17) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- {11, 16, 17, 1}
- {3, 15, 18, 0}
- {14, 17, 1, 5}
- {7, 14, 17, 1}
- {14, 17, 12, 17}
- {14, 17, 1, 19}
- {4, 15, 18, 0}
- {14, 13, 5, 1}
- {5, 14, 17, 1}
- {13, 14, 17, 1}
- {7, 9, 14, 17}
- {9, 14, 17, 1}
- {10, 2, 4, 15}
- {15, 3, 13, 19}
- {3, 6, 5, 1}
- {3, 13, 19, 0}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The cycle {11, 16, 17, 1} has exactly one chord (16, 17)
- The cycle {3, 15, 18, 0} has exactly one chord (15, 18)
- The cycle {14, 13, 5, 1} has exactly one chord (13, 5)
- The cycle {13, 14, 17, 1} has exactly one chord (14, 17)
- The cycle {9, 14, 17, 1} has exactly one chord (14, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<11, 16, 17, 1>
<3, 15, 18, 0>
<14, 13, 5, 1>
<13, 14, 17, 1>
<9, 14, 17, 1>
