Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 8) (21, 17) (15, 5) (15, 4) (27, 10) (27, 17) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 23) (8, 21) (8, 16) (8, 22) (13, 3) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 24) (2, 16) (2, 20) (18, 19) (18, 20) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 23) (14, 4) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 28) (26, 13) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 16) (26, 12) (7, 28) (17, 21) (17, 27) (17, 13) (17, 20) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 17) (20, 10) (29, 5) (29, 11) (10, 21) (10, 27) (10, 3) (10, 20) (10, 6) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 9) (12, 26) (12, 24) (23, 25) (23, 14) (23, 26) (22, 8) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 24) (24, 13) (24, 12) (24, 11) (24, 5) (9, 25) (9, 4) (28, 19) (28, 7) (6, 0) (6, 10) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 29) (5, 24) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 26) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 21, 17, 13, 3, 25, 9, 4, 14, 0, 6, 10, 27, 17, 20, 2, 16, 26, 12, 24, 11, 29, 5, 15, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (3, 25, 23, 14, 0, 5, 1, 11, 29, 5, 15, 4, 14, 23, 26, 16, 2, 20, 18, 19, 3)
- Cycle 3: (8, 21, 17, 13, 3, 10, 20, 2, 16, 26, 12, 24, 11, 29, 5, 15, 4, 9, 25, 23, 14, 4, 15, 5, 29, 11, 1, 21, 10, 27, 17, 20)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has 6 chords: (21, 8), (8, 16), (16, 22), (22, 8), (16, 26), (26, 12) - Not a chordal cycle.
- Cycle 2 has 5 chords: (0, 6), (6, 10), (10, 20), (20, 18), (18, 19) - Not a chordal cycle.
- Cycle 3 has 6 chords: (17, 27), (27, 13), (13, 17), (17, 20), (20, 10), (10, 3) - Not a chordal cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are no chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
