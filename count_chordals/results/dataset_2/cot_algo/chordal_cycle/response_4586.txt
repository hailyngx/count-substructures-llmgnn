Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 18) (7, 21) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 20) (21, 8) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 16) (22, 18) (22, 28) (8, 21) (8, 23) (8, 11) (23, 8) (28, 21) (28, 22) (28, 26) (28, 25) (26, 28) (26, 25) (26, 0) (26, 17) (9, 29) (9, 2) (29, 9) (29, 13) (29, 0) (29, 3) (19, 17) (19, 12) (11, 8) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 17) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 14) (1, 25) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (25, 28) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 10) (0, 15) (0, 26) (0, 29) (20, 21) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 16) (3, 29) (3, 5) (10, 25) (10, 20) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 29) (16, 18) (16, 20) (16, 6) (14, 24) (14, 2) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (6, 20) (6, 16) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 10) (4, 11) (4, 17) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (15, 27, 24, 12, 15)
- Cycle 2: (7, 21, 28, 22, 18, 27, 24, 11, 17, 4, 11, 7)
- Cycle 3: (21, 20, 10, 25, 1, 12, 15, 5, 7, 21)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: <(15, 27), (15, 12)>
- Cycle 2 has 2 chords: <(7, 28), (21, 22)>
- Cycle 3 has 2 chords: <(21, 10), (25, 12)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Hence, the final number of unique chordal 4-cycles is [0].
