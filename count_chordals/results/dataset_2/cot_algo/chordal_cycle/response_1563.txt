Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 5) (0, 5) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 4) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 2) (19, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 18) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

The cycles in the given graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 3 - 15 - 8 - 1 - 6 - 9 - 7 - 13 - 15
2. Cycle 2: 3 - 15 - 13 - 7 - 9 - 6
3. Cycle 3: 3 - 10 - 4 - 2 - 11 - 5 - 0 - 5 - 19 - 2
4. Cycle 4: 3 - 16 - 14 - 8 - 15
5. Cycle 5: 6 - 9 - 7 - 13 - 15 - 18 - 6
6. Cycle 6: 6 - 12 - 5 - 0 - 5 - 11 - 2 - 4 - 10 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Checking each cycle for a chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 1 - 6
- Cycle 2 has no chord
- Cycle 3 has a chord 5 - 2
- Cycle 4 has no chord
- Cycle 5 has a chord 18 - 6
- Cycle 6 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The chordless cycles are:
- Cycle 2: <3, 15, 13, 7, 9, 6>
- Cycle 4: <3, 16, 14, 8, 15>
- Cycle 6: <6, 12, 5, 0, 5, 11, 2, 4, 10, 3>

Putting the final number inside brackets gives [3].
