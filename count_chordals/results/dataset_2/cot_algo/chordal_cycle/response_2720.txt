Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 9) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <1, 2, 3, 5, 1> with edges (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 5), (5, 1)
2. Cycle <1, 5, 10, 7, 1> with edges (1, 5), (5, 10), (10, 7), (7, 1)
3. Cycle <1, 9, 8, 4, 1> with edges (1, 9), (9, 8), (8, 4), (4, 1)
4. Cycle <1, 12, 9, 8, 1> with edges (1, 12), (12, 9), (9, 8), (8, 1)
5. Cycle <3, 2, 10, 14, 3> with edges (3, 2), (2, 10), (10, 14), (14, 3)
6. Cycle <4, 8, 9, 12, 4> with edges (4, 8), (8, 9), (9, 12), (12, 4)
7. Cycle <4, 13, 6, 0, 4> with edges (4, 13), (13, 6), (6, 0), (0, 4)
8. Cycle <4, 14, 10, 2, 4> with edges (4, 14), (14, 10), (10, 2), (2, 4)
9. Cycle <8, 9, 1, 5, 8> with edges (8, 9), (9, 1), (1, 5), (5, 8)
10. Cycle <10, 0, 13, 6, 10> with edges (10, 0), (0, 13), (13, 6), (6, 10)
11. Cycle <10, 2, 7, 11, 10> with edges (10, 2), (2, 7), (7, 11), (11, 10)
12. Cycle <13, 5, 1, 12, 13> with edges (13, 5), (5, 1), (1, 12), (12, 13)
13. Cycle <13, 14, 11, 7, 13> with edges (13, 14), (14, 11), (11, 7), (7, 13)
14. Cycle <14, 6, 13, 0, 14> with edges (14, 6), (6, 13), (13, 0), (0, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <1, 2, 3, 5, 1> has a chord (2, 5)
- Cycle <1, 5, 10, 7, 1> has a chord (5, 10)
- Cycle <3, 2, 10, 14, 3> has a chord (2, 10)
- Cycle <4, 8, 9, 12, 4> has a chord (8, 9)
- Cycle <4, 13, 6, 0, 4> has a chord (13, 6)
- Cycle <4, 14, 10, 2, 4> has a chord (10, 14)
- Cycle <8, 9, 1, 5, 8> has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle <10, 0, 13, 6, 10> has a chord (0, 13)
- Cycle <10, 2, 7, 11, 10> has a chord (2, 7)
- Cycle <13, 5, 1, 12, 13> has a chord (5, 12)
- Cycle <13, 14, 11, 7, 13> has a chord (11, 14)
- Cycle <14, 6, 13, 0, 14> has a chord (6, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [12].
