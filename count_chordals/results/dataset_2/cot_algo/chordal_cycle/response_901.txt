Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 6) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 12) (15, 1) (15, 16) (19, 2) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 7) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 16) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-17-10-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-17-11-6-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-1-12-0
- Cycle 4: 0-2-19-2-0
- Cycle 5: 1-12-4-8-1
- Cycle 6: 1-12-4-8-6-1
- Cycle 7: 1-12-4-12-1
- Cycle 8: 1-15-16-14-1
- Cycle 9: 2-0-17-11-2
- Cycle 10: 2-0-16-14-2
- Cycle 11: 2-1-12-4-2
- Cycle 12: 2-7-6-11-2

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycle is:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (10, 17), 7, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (6, 11), 17, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (1, 12), 2, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (14, 16), 15, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, (4, 12), 1, 2>

Step 3:
As there are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [5].
