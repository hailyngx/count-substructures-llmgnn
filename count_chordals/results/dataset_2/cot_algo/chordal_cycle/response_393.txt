Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 5) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (9, 4, 2, 7, 6, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 4, 2, 5, 8, 11, 13, 3, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 4, 10, 3, 13, 11, 8, 5, 12, 6, 9)
- Cycle 4: (2, 3, 13, 11, 8, 5, 12, 6, 7, 14, 10, 4, 2)
- Cycle 5: (14, 10, 4, 2, 1, 5, 8, 0, 6, 7, 14)
- Cycle 6: (10, 4, 2, 3, 13, 12, 5, 8, 0, 11, 14, 10)
- Cycle 7: (2, 3, 9, 6, 0, 11, 13, 12, 5, 1, 4, 2)
- Cycle 8: (5, 12, 13, 3, 10, 14, 7, 6, 0, 8, 11, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 9: (6, 12, 5, 8, 0, 11, 13, 3, 10, 14, 7, 6)
- Cycle 10: (2, 4, 10, 14, 11, 0, 5, 1, 3, 13, 12, 6, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- The chordal 4-cycle is <2, (1, 4), 5>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- There is 9 chordless 4-cycles in total.

So, the final answer is [9].
