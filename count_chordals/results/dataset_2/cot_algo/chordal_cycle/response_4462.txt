This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 17) (22, 7) (2, 29) (2, 17) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 18) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 26) (6, 19) (9, 22) (9, 6) (9, 15) (0, 27) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 23) (27, 13) (27, 0) (27, 19) (15, 2) (15, 9) (15, 20) (15, 8) (20, 15) (21, 4) (21, 24) (28, 14) (28, 25) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 12) (17, 22) (17, 2) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 16) (5, 25) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 27) (19, 24) (8, 0) (8, 15) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 16) (12, 1) (12, 4) (25, 0) (25, 28) (25, 17) (25, 5) (10, 26) (10, 14) (26, 6) (26, 10) (26, 3) (11, 22) (11, 24) (11, 18) (24, 21) (24, 19) (24, 4) (24, 11) (3, 26) (3, 14) (14, 28) (14, 10) (14, 3) (18, 29) (18, 11) (23, 0) (23, 7) (16, 29) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 4) (7, 22) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <2, 17, 25, 5, 7>
- <2, 17, 1, 12, 4>
- <2, 17, 1, 16, 29>
- <2, 17, 1, 12, 4, 24>
- <2, 17, 1, 16, 29, 18>
- <6, 9, 15, 8, 0>
- <6, 9, 15, 2, 17>
- <6, 9, 15, 20, 15>
- <6, 9, 15, 2, 29>
- <6, 9, 15, 20, 15, 8>
- <6, 9, 15, 2, 17, 25>
- <6, 9, 15, 20, 15, 8, 0>
- <6, 9, 15, 2, 17, 25, 5>
- <6, 9, 15, 20, 15, 8, 0, 23>
- <22, 17, 25, 5, 7>
- <22, 17, 1, 12, 4>
- <22, 17, 1, 16, 29>
- <22, 17, 1, 12, 4, 24>
- <22, 17, 1, 16, 29, 18>
- <22, 9, 15, 8, 0>
- <22, 9, 15, 2, 17>
- <22, 9, 15, 20, 15>
- <22, 9, 15, 2, 29>
- <22, 9, 15, 20, 15, 8>
- <22, 9, 15, 2, 17, 25>
- <22, 9, 15, 20, 15, 8, 0>
- <22, 9, 15, 2, 17, 25, 5>
- <22, 9, 15, 20, 15, 8, 0, 23>
- <9, 15, 2, 17, 25, 5> 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, 9, 15, 8, 0>
- <6, 9, 15, 2, 17>
- <22, 9, 15, 8, 0>
- <22, 9, 15, 2, 17>
- <9, 15, 2, 17, 25, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <6, 9, 15, (2, 17), 15, 8, 0>
2. <22, 9, 15, (2, 17), 15, 8, 0>
3. <9, 15, (2, 17), 25, 5>
