Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 23) (21, 11) (6, 2) (9, 28) (9, 27) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 21) (11, 10) (11, 23) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 25) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 5) (28, 15) (29, 8) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 15) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 27) (14, 20) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 17) (3, 21) (3, 20) (23, 21) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 17) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 16) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 22) (24, 19) (24, 2) (22, 4) (22, 16) (5, 28) (5, 18) (5, 23) (5, 15) (13, 0) (13, 2) (20, 14) (20, 3) (20, 12) (20, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 24) (2, 13) (2, 20) (12, 10) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 26) (12, 19) (15, 4) (15, 28) (15, 29) (15, 5) (15, 26) (26, 12) (26, 15) (26, 27) (27, 9) (27, 14) (27, 26) (17, 18) (17, 23) (17, 12) (25, 8) (19, 24) (19, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle <1, 21, 23, 11>
2. Cycle <4, 8, 29, 7>
3. Cycle <5, 23, 11, 21>
4. Cycle <2, 24, 19, 12>
5. Cycle <15, 29, 8, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Cycle <1, 21, 23, 11> has a chord (1, 11)
2. Cycle <4, 8, 29, 7> has a chord (4, 29)
3. Cycle <5, 23, 11, 21> has a chord (5, 11)
4. Cycle <2, 24, 19, 12> has a chord (2, 19)
5. Cycle <15, 29, 8, 4> has a chord (15, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. Since all cycles have exactly one chord, there are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [0].
