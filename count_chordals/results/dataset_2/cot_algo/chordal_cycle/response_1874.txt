Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 11) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 1) (13, 14) (13, 15) (8, 5) (8, 16) (9, 4) (9, 15) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 19) (1, 7) (1, 18) (1, 16) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 16) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 9) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <10, 7, 12, 11, 10>
- Cycle 2: <11, 18, 4, 9, 15, 13, 14, 10, 7, 12, 11>
- Cycle 3: <10, 14, 13, 15, 9, 4, 18, 11, 10>
- Cycle 4: <10, 3, 2, 7, 12, 11, 18, 4, 17, 19, 16, 1, 16, 8, 5, 17, 4, 9, 15, 13, 14, 10>

Step 2:
Only Cycle 1 has a chord. The chord is (7, 11), connecting non-adjacent nodes 7 and 11.

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles = 3, so the final number to put inside brackets is [3]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <11, 18, 4, 9>
