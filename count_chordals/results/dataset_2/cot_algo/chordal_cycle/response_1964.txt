Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-7-4-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-7-4-0-5
- Cycle 3: 5-7-9-4-5
- Cycle 4: 5-7-9-8-5
- Cycle 5: 5-8-9-4-5
- Cycle 6: 5-8-4-0-5
- Cycle 7: 5-0-4-1-5
- Cycle 8: 5-0-4-7-5
- Cycle 9: 5-0-3-7-5
- Cycle 10: 5-3-7-4-5
- Cycle 11: 5-3-7-9-5
- Cycle 12: 5-3-0-4-5
- Cycle 13: 5-6-1-4-5
- Cycle 14: 5-6-3-0-5

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (4, 0), 5>
- <2, (8, 0), 5>
- <3, (9, 5), 7>
- <4, (9, 7), 5>
- <5, (8, 4), 9>
- <6, (1, 3), 5>
- <7, (3, 5), 7>
- <8, (3, 1), 6>

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (4, 0), 5>
<2, (8, 0), 5>
<3, (9, 5), 7>
<4, (9, 7), 5>
<5, (8, 4), 9>
<6, (1, 3), 5>
<7, (3, 5), 7>
<8, (3, 1), 6>
