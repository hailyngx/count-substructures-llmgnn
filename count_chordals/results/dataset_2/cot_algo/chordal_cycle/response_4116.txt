Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (6, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 7, 11>
2. <0, 1, 13, 11>
3. <0, 1, 3, 5>
4. <0, 9, 6, 8>
5. <0, 9, 4, 8>
6. <1, 2, 9, 3>
7. <1, 2, 8, 0>
8. <1, 2, 14, 12>
9. <1, 11, 10, 6>
10. <1, 11, 13, 12>
11. <1, 11, 0, 7>
12. <3, 5, 6, 9>
13. <3, 5, 6, 8>
14. <6, 10, 14, 12>
15. <6, 8, 2, 1>
16. <6, 9, 2, 1>
17. <6, 9, 4, 8>
18. <7, 11, 10, 6>
19. <8, 2, 14, 12>
20. <8, 2, 12, 13>
21. <8, 4, 9, 6>
22. <9, 0, 8, 12>
23. <9, 0, 7, 11>
24. <9, 2, 1, 0>

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, only the cycle <0, 1, 3, 5> has exactly one chord (0, 3). Hence, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <0, 1, 3, 5> with a chord (0, 3).

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, so the final count is [1].
