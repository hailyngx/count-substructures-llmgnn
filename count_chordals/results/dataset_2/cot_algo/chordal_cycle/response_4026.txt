Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 7-5-6-1-7
- Cycle 2: 7-5-8-9-7
- Cycle 3: 7-4-9-8-7
- Cycle 4: 7-4-3-6-7
- Cycle 5: 7-4-2-1-7
- Cycle 6: 7-0-1-2-7
- Cycle 7: 7-0-9-4-7

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (5, 6), 7>
- Cycle 2: <2, (5, 8), 7>
- Cycle 3: <3, (4, 9), 7>
- Cycle 4: <4, (4, 3), 7>
- Cycle 5: <5, (4, 2), 7>
- Cycle 6: <6, (0, 1), 7>
- Cycle 7: <7, (0, 9), 4>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
