Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 2: (4, 0, 3, 2)
- Cycle 3: (7, 6, 2, 0)
- Cycle 4: (9, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 5: (8, 5, 2, 6)

Step 2:
Checking for the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (0, 3)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (6, 2)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (5, 2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (1, 7), 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3), 4, 2)>
<3, (6, 2), 7, 0)>
<4, (1, 7), 9, 3)>
<5, (5, 2), 8, 6)>
