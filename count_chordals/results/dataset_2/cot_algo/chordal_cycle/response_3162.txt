Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2: 
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3:
- Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is 0.
- Putting this in brackets, the final answer is [0].
