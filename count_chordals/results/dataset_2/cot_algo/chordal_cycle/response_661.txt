Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 0) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 19) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) (7, 17) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 15) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (18, 6) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 14) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 8) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (3, 10) (14, 4) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 17) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

    - Cycle 1: (2, 11, 1, 0, 16, 10, 17, 7, 8, 19, 9, 6, 2)
    - Cycle 2: (2, 11, 1, 15, 14, 4, 13, 0, 16, 10, 17, 7, 8, 19, 9, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

    - From Cycle 1, there are no chords.
    - From Cycle 2, the chord <1, 6> exists.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

    - The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, 6> with the chord <1, 6>.
