Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle <0, 2, 14, 4>
2. Cycle <0, 4, 7, 6>
3. Cycle <0, 4, 12, 3>
4. Cycle <0, 8, 9, 6>
5. Cycle <0, 8, 5, 1>
6. Cycle <0, 14, 10, 6>
7. Cycle <1, 5, 11, 4>
8. Cycle <1, 11, 12, 3>
9. Cycle <2, 0, 8, 5>
10. Cycle <2, 14, 10, 6>
11. Cycle <3, 12, 4, 11>
12. Cycle <4, 7, 6, 14>
13. Cycle <4, 11, 9, 8>
14. Cycle <5, 8, 0, 4>
15. Cycle <5, 11, 9, 6>
16. Cycle <6, 13, 2, 0>
17. Cycle <6, 9, 8, 5>
18. Cycle <7, 4, 12, 3>
19. Cycle <9, 11, 1, 5>
20. Cycle <10, 14, 2, 0>
21. Cycle <11, 1, 3, 12>
22. Cycle <13, 2, 0, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 2, 14, 4, (0, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 5, 11, 4, (1, 11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, 0, 8, 5, (0, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, 12, 4, 11, (4, 11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <4, 7, 6, 14, (4, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <5, 8, 0, 4, (0, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 9, 8, 5, (8, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <7, 4, 12, 3, (4, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, 11, 1, 5, (1, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <10, 14, 2, 0, (2, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <13, 2, 0, 8, (2, 0)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
