Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: <5, 4, 6, 1, 5>  
- Cycle 2: <5, 7, 0, 8, 5>  
- Cycle 3: <9, 4, 7, 2, 9>  
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 2, 8, 0>  
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 7, 4, 1>  
- Cycle 6: <3, 9, 4, 6, 3>  
- Cycle 7: <2, 9, 3, 1, 2>  
- Cycle 8: <1, 6, 4, 9, 1>  
- Cycle 9: <0, 5, 1, 8, 0>  
- Cycle 10: <9, 0, 7, 4, 9>  
- Cycle 11: <7, 4, 6, 2, 7>  
- Cycle 12: <4, 5, 8, 0, 4>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- Checking Cycle 1: <5, 4, 6, 1, 5> does not have a chord.  
- Checking Cycle 2: <5, 7, 0, 8, 5> has a chord (7, 8).  
- Checking Cycle 3: <9, 4, 7, 2, 9> has a chord (4, 2).  
- Checking Cycle 4: <0, 7, 2, 8, 0> has a chord (7, 8).  
- Checking Cycle 5: <1, 5, 7, 4, 1> has a chord (5, 4).  
- Checking Cycle 6: <3, 9, 4, 6, 3> does not have a chord.  
- Checking Cycle 7: <2, 9, 3, 1, 2> does not have a chord.  
- Checking Cycle 8: <1, 6, 4, 9, 1> does not have a chord.  
- Checking Cycle 9: <0, 5, 1, 8, 0> has a chord (5, 8).  
- Checking Cycle 10: <9, 0, 7, 4, 9> has a chord (0, 7).  
- Checking Cycle 11: <7, 4, 6, 2, 7> has a chord (4, 6).  
- Checking Cycle 12: <4, 5, 8, 0, 4> has a chord (5, 8).  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
There are 4 chordless cycles.  

Therefore, the final answer is [4].  
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:  
1. <5, 4, 6, 1>  
2. <3, 9, 4, 6>  
3. <2, 9, 3, 1>  
4. <1, 6, 4, 9>
