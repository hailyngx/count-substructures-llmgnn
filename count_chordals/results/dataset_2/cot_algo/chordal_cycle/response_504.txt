Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 5) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 9) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (6, 12) (2, 0) (2, 16) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 19) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 2) (12, 11) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (0, 1, 15, 13, 0)
- (1, 17, 15, 13, 1)
- (1, 17, 15, 5, 1)
- (1, 17, 14, 0, 1)
- (4, 9, 19, 16, 4)
- (4, 9, 19, 5, 4)
- (7, 13, 15, 1, 7)
- (7, 13, 15, 6, 7)
- (8, 1, 17, 14, 8)
- (8, 1, 17, 15, 8)
- (9, 3, 1, 17, 9)
- (11, 7, 13, 15, 11)
- (12, 11, 7, 13, 12)
- (12, 6, 17, 14, 12)
- (12, 6, 17, 15, 12)
- (13, 0, 14, 17, 13)
- (15, 6, 17, 14, 15)
- (16, 2, 0, 13, 16)
- (16, 2, 0, 14, 16)

Step 2:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Step 3:
Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, 17, 14, 8>

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
