Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 26) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (27, 21) (27, 11) (27, 16) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 14) (21, 27) (21, 7) (21, 4) (21, 18) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 6) (23, 3) (23, 11) (23, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 20) (10, 29) (11, 0) (11, 27) (11, 23) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 18) (2, 10) (2, 29) (2, 9) (29, 10) (29, 2) (1, 15) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 28) (26, 3) (26, 1) (5, 1) (5, 25) (5, 24) (6, 22) (6, 23) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 20) (18, 21) (18, 13) (16, 27) (16, 7) (16, 28) (16, 20) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 25) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 28) (17, 3) (17, 8) (25, 5) (25, 28) (19, 22) (19, 12) (14, 7) (14, 8) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 28) (12, 19) (20, 10) (20, 4) (20, 16) (24, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  

- Cycle 1: <3, 15, 1, 26, 3>  
- Cycle 2: <3, 15, 7, 21, 27, 11, 3>  
- Cycle 3: <10, 0, 11, 23, 3, 15, 7, 21, 27, 10>  
- Cycle 4: <13, 8, 17, 3, 15, 7, 21, 27, 11, 13>
- Cycle 5: <18, 21, 27, 11, 23, 6, 22, 4, 20, 16, 28, 25, 5, 24, 15, 1, 26, 3, 12, 8, 14, 7, 21, 18>
- Cycle 6: <19, 22, 6, 23, 11, 27, 21, 7, 15, 3, 12, 19>
- Cycle 7: <20, 10, 0, 11, 23, 6, 22, 4, 21, 16, 28, 25, 5, 26, 1, 15, 7, 14, 8, 17, 3, 12, 20>
- Cycle 8: <24, 5, 25, 28, 16, 20, 4, 22, 6, 23, 11, 27, 21, 7, 15, 1, 26, 3, 12, 19, 24>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <3, (15, 26), 1>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There is 7 chordless cycles found in the graph.  

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
