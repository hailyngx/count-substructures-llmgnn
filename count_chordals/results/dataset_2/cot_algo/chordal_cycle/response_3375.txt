Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 9) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 14) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (0, 10, 7, 1, 4, 8, 5, 11, 9, 13, 3, 6, 12, 2)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 10, 7, 1, 4, 2, 12, 6, 3, 9, 11, 5, 8)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in the cycles:
        - Cycle 1 has chords: (0, 7), (1, 8), (4, 5), (5, 11), (9, 13), (3, 6), (6, 2), (12, 8)
        - Cycle 2 has chords: (0, 7), (1, 2), (4, 8), (2, 6), (3, 5), (9, 11), (13, 14), (14, 12)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are a total of [2] unique chordal 4-cycles found.

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        <0, 10, 7, 1> with chord (4, 5)
        <4, 8, 5, 11> with chord (2, 6)
