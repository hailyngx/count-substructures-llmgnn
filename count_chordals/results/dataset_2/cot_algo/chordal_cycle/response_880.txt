Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 23) (20, 4) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 28) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 9) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 2) (1, 8) (1, 26) (26, 25) (26, 1) (26, 17) (18, 27) (18, 23) (18, 0) (18, 29) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 16) (17, 26) (17, 10) (17, 21) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 0) (9, 27) (9, 29) (29, 18) (29, 9) (29, 6) (29, 24) (21, 10) (21, 17) (21, 11) (2, 25) (2, 23) (2, 3) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 14) (11, 24) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 28) (24, 7) (24, 29) (24, 11) (3, 7) (3, 20) (3, 2) (3, 16) (0, 18) (0, 19) (6, 29) (6, 15) (6, 16) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 3) (16, 6) (28, 20) (28, 14) (15, 5) (15, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles:
1. (4, 7, 3, 20, 4)
2. (4, 20, 28, 14, 12, 19, 5, 4)
3. (7, 24, 29, 6, 15, 5, 19, 8, 13, 8, 1, 26, 17, 10, 21, 11, 24, 7)
4. (20, 16, 3, 2, 25, 26, 1, 8, 11, 21, 10, 17, 26, 25, 20)
5. (25, 2, 23, 18, 27, 12, 14, 28, 20, 25)
6. (8, 19, 0, 18, 23, 7, 4, 20, 25, 26, 17, 10, 16, 6, 29, 24, 11, 21, 17, 26, 1, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <4, 5, 19, 8>
2. <20, 28, 14, 12>
3. <8, 13, 17, 10>
4. <25, 2, 23, 18>
5. <19, 0, 18, 23>
6. <0, 18, 23, 7>
7. <7, 24, 11, 21>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [7].
