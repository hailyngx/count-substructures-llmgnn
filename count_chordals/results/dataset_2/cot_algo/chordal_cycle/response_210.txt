Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 1) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- <1, 13, 5, 4, 1>
- <4, 10, 13, 5, 4>
- <7, 10, 13, 5, 7>
- <9, 11, 4, 2, 9>
- <12, 1, 13, 10, 12>

Step 2: 
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 13, 5, 4, 1> with chord (1, 13)
- <4, 10, 13, 5, 4> with chord (4, 13)

Step 3: 
Count of chordless cycles: [3]

List of unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, 13, 5, 4>
