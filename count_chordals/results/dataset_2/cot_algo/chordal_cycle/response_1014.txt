Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 9, 8)
- Cycle 2: (4, 13, 5, 8)
- Cycle 3: (7, 9, 8, 5)
- Cycle 4: (7, 0, 4, 13)
- Cycle 5: (7, 0, 3, 12)
- Cycle 6: (5, 13, 6, 0)
- Cycle 7: (5, 13, 2, 3)
- Cycle 8: (5, 8, 1, 6)
- Cycle 9: (13, 6, 1, 8)
- Cycle 10: (13, 12, 3, 2)
- Cycle 11: (0, 6, 1, 8)
- Cycle 12: (8, 9, 7, 0)
- Cycle 13: (3, 0, 7, 4)
- Cycle 14: (3, 2, 13, 5)
- Cycle 15: (3, 12, 10, 14)
- Cycle 16: (6, 1, 8, 9)
- Cycle 17: (6, 13, 4, 0)
- Cycle 18: (6, 0, 3, 12)
- Cycle 19: (6, 2, 13, 5)
- Cycle 20: (6, 12, 3, 2)
- Cycle 21: (10, 5, 13, 6)
- Cycle 22: (10, 12, 13, 5)
- Cycle 23: (11, 5, 13, 2)
- Cycle 24: (11, 14, 10, 12)
- Cycle 25: (14, 10, 12, 3)
- Cycle 26: (14, 10, 12, 11)
- Cycle 27: (14, 4, 0, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (5, 13), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

- Number of chordal 4-cycles = [1]
