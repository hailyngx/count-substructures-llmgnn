Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:  
- Cycle 1: 0-6-2-9-0  
- Cycle 2: 0-6-2-4-8-0  
- Cycle 3: 0-6-5-7-2-0  

Step 2:  
Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:  
- Cycle 1: 0-6-2-9-0 has a chord {6, 9}. This is a chordal 4-cycle.  
- Cycle 2: 0-6-2-4-8-0 has a chord {6, 8}. This is a chordal 4-cycle.  
- Cycle 3: 0-6-5-7-2-0 has a chord {6, 7}. This is a chordal 4-cycle.  

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:  
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].  

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:  
<1, (6, 9)>  
<2, (6, 8)>  
<3, (6, 7)>
