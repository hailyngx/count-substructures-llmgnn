Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 5) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 0) (13, 6) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 4) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 21) (28, 26) (28, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 16) (19, 21) (19, 6) (19, 9) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 9) (16, 13) (16, 1) (21, 26) (21, 19) (21, 2) (21, 17) (29, 1) (2, 21) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 11) (5, 27) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (3, 27) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 12) (17, 21) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 11) (9, 28) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 17) (9, 25) (25, 9) (25, 12) (22, 14) (24, 13) (24, 3) (24, 10) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 18) (6, 20) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 25) (12, 11) (10, 5) (10, 24) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 12) (4, 23) (18, 6) (20, 2) (20, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- <15, 1, 29, 1>
- <15, 23, 4, 23>
- <15, 27, 5, 27>
- <15, 14, 26, 14>
- <27, 5, 2, 21>
- <27, 3, 24, 13>
- <8, 23, 4, 23>
- <8, 13, 24, 13>
- <13, 24, 3, 27>
- <13, 16, 1, 29>
- <23, 4, 14, 26>
- <26, 14, 22, 14>
- <0, 13, 24, 3>
- <7, 0, 13, 24>
- <7, 8, 13, 24>
- <1, 29, 1, 15>
- <14, 26, 21, 2>
- <16, 1, 29, 1>
- <21, 2, 5, 27>
- <21, 26, 14, 22>
- <29, 1, 15, 27>
- <2, 21, 17, 3>
- <2, 5, 27, 15>
- <5, 27, 15, 23>
- <3, 27, 15, 14>
- <24, 3, 27, 15>
- <6, 19, 21, 2>
- <12, 25, 9, 19>
- <10, 24, 13, 16>
- <11, 12, 25, 9>
- <4, 23, 8, 13>
- <18, 6, 19, 21>
- <20, 6, 19, 21>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the chordal 4-cycles:
- <15, 1, 29, 1, (16, 13)>
- <27, 5, 2, 21, (21, 14)>
- <8, 13, 24, 13, (24, 3)>
- <23, 4, 14, 26, (26, 22)>
- <13, 24, 3, 27, (3, 15)>
- <24, 3, 27, 15, (27, 14)>
- <7, 0, 13, 24, (13, 6)>
- <21, 2, 5, 27, (5, 15)>
- <29, 1, 15, 27, (1, 23)>
- <2, 21, 17, 3, (17, 9)>
- <5, 27, 15, 23, (15, 14)>
- <24, 3, 27, 15, (27, 5)>
- <12, 25, 9, 19, (9, 6)>
- <10, 24, 13, 16, (13, 1)>
- <11, 12, 25, 9, (12, 6)>
- <18, 6, 19, 21, (19, 2)> 

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we get [15].
