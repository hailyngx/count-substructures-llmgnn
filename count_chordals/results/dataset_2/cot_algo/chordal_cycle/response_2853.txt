Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 5) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 17) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 7) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 16) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 19) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (19, 3) (19, 12) (13, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (17, 18) (17, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (2, 8, 15, 5, 6, 1, 13)
- Cycle 2: (2, 8, 15, 5, 0, 11, 10, 4)
- Cycle 3: (2, 8, 15, 5, 0, 11, 9, 14, 7, 12)
- Cycle 4: (2, 8, 15, 5, 6, 4, 10, 11)
- Cycle 5: (2, 8, 15, 5, 0, 14, 7, 17, 18)
- Cycle 6: (2, 8, 14, 7, 17, 18, 16)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 4: (2, 8, 15, 5, 6, 4, 10, 11) has exactly one chord (6, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found: <Cycle 4, (6, 10)>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].
