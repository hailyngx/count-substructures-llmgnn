Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 5-6-4-7-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-8-1-0-5
        - Cycle 3: 5-9-7-4-5
        - Cycle 4: 3-12-7-4-3
        - Cycle 5: 10-6-4-13-10
        - Cycle 6: 10-13-12-7-10
        - Cycle 7: 11-0-1-8-11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord: (6, 4)
        - Cycle 2 has a chord: (1, 8)
        - Cycle 3 has a chord: (9, 7)
        - Cycle 4 has a chord: (7, 4)
        - Cycle 5 has a chord: (6, 4)
        - Cycle 6 has a chord: (7, 12)
        - Cycle 7 has a chord: (0, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        - None.
