Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 14) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
- With no cycles of length 4 or more, we cannot find any chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Step 3:
- The number of chordless cycles found is 0, so the final count is [0].
