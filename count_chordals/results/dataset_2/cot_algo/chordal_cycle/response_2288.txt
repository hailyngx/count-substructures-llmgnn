Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 3) (9, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 0) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 10) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 0) (8, 5) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 4) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 18) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 3) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 3) (12, 14) (12, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
   - Cycle 1: (0, 6, 10, 19)
   - Cycle 2: (0, 6, 14, 12)
   - Cycle 3: (0, 15, 7, 16)
   - Cycle 4: (0, 15, 1, 14)
   - Cycle 5: (1, 14, 12, 3)
   - Cycle 6: (3, 12, 14, 6)
   - Cycle 7: (3, 12, 4, 16)
   - Cycle 8: (3, 4, 14, 1)
   - Cycle 9: (4, 14, 12, 3)
   - Cycle 10: (5, 19, 10, 6)
   - Cycle 11: (5, 19, 18, 0)
   - Cycle 12: (5, 17, 0, 15)
   - Cycle 13: (5, 17, 13, 3)
   - Cycle 14: (6, 14, 12, 3)
   - Cycle 15: (6, 14, 1, 15)
   - Cycle 16: (7, 16, 4, 3)
   - Cycle 17: (7, 15, 1, 14)
   - Cycle 18: (9, 13, 17, 5)
   - Cycle 19: (11, 14, 6, 10)
   - Cycle 20: (11, 14, 1, 15)

Step 2:
   - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, 12, 4, 16> (chord: 4, 16)
   - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 6, 14, 12> (chord: 6, 14)

Step 3:
   - There are [2] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
