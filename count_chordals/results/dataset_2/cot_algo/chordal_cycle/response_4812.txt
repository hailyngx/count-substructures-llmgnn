Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. <5, 9, 2, 8, 5>
2. <6, 9, 2, 8, 6>
3. <6, 9, 7, 0, 6>
4. <6, 9, 0, 4, 6>
5. <6, 4, 8, 2, 6>
6. <4, 8, 7, 0, 4>
7. <8, 7, 9, 2, 8>

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord (forming a chordal 4-cycle) are:
1. <6, 9, 2, 8, 6, (5, 1)>
2. <6, 9, 7, 0, 6, (4, 1)>
3. <6, 9, 0, 4, 6, (8, 1)>
4. <4, 8, 7, 0, 4, (6, 1)>

Step 3: 
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [4]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <6, 9, 2, 8, 6, (5, 1)>
2. <6, 9, 7, 0, 6, (4, 1)>
3. <6, 9, 0, 4, 6, (8, 1)>
4. <4, 8, 7, 0, 4, (6, 1)>
