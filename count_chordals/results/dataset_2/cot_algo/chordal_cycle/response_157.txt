Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 2) (27, 4) (27, 21) (27, 7) (27, 26) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 21) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 29) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 20) (20, 13) (25, 9) (25, 6) (6, 25) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 24) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 22) (28, 10) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 16) (22, 17) (22, 28) (22, 26) (22, 7) (22, 12) (26, 27) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 10) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 24) (21, 27) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 16) (9, 14) (9, 25) (12, 22) (12, 19) (16, 2) (16, 21) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 3) (18, 1) (19, 2) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 3) (24, 6) (24, 4) (24, 0) (24, 10) (10, 28) (10, 26) (10, 19) (10, 24) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (1, 14) (1, 18) (1, 7) (11, 5) (3, 18) (3, 19) (3, 5) (7, 27) (7, 22) (7, 1) (0, 4) (0, 24) (29, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (13, 26, 22, 17)
- (13, 26, 22, 28)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <13, (26, 22), 17>
- <13, (26, 22), 28>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there are no chordless cycles found, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
