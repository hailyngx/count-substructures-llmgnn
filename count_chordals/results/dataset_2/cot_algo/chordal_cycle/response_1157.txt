Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 10) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Possible cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-9-5
- Cycle 2: 0-5-11-2-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-11-7-1-0
- Cycle 4: 0-6-5-9-5-4-0
- Cycle 5: 0-6-5-11-2-10-3-0
- Cycle 6: 0-6-8-3-12-0
- Cycle 7: 1-0-5-9-5-11-2-1
- Cycle 8: 1-0-6-5-9-5-4-13-1
- Cycle 9: 1-2-10-3-8-1
- Cycle 10: 1-2-11-5-9-5-4-13-1
- Cycle 11: 1-7-11-5-9-5-4-13-1
- Cycle 12: 2-10-3-8-1-7-2
- Cycle 13: 3-0-5-9-5-4-13-3
- Cycle 14: 3-0-6-5-11-2-10-3
- Cycle 15: 3-0-12-14-2-11-5-9-3
- Cycle 16: 3-4-13-1-2-11-5-9-3
- Cycle 17: 3-6-8-1-7-11-5-9-3
- Cycle 18: 4-5-11-2-10-3-4
- Cycle 19: 4-5-9-5-11-7-1-4
- Cycle 20: 4-13-1-0-6-5-11-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, (5, 9), 4>
- <0, (5, 11), 2>
- <0, (6, 9), 4>
- <0, (6, 11), 10>
- <1, (2, 10), 3>
- <1, (7, 11), 5>
- <3, (4, 13), 1>
- <3, (6, 8), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [20] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
