Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-8-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-2-4-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-1-7-5
- Cycle 4: 5-4-2-7-5
- Cycle 5: 5-4-7-6-5
- Cycle 6: 5-4-8-1-5
- Cycle 7: 9-6-7-4-9
- Cycle 8: 9-6-8-5-9
- Cycle 9: 9-2-4-7-9
- Cycle 10: 9-2-3-0-9
- Cycle 11: 9-1-7-4-9
- Cycle 12: 9-1-8-5-9
- Cycle 13: 4-7-6-8-4
- Cycle 14: 4-7-2-9-4
- Cycle 15: 4-2-3-0-4
- Cycle 16: 4-2-7-6-4
- Cycle 17: 7-1-8-6-7
- Cycle 18: 7-1-5-4-7
- Cycle 19: 7-6-8-5-7
- Cycle 20: 7-6-9-2-7
- Cycle 21: 1-5-4-7-1
- Cycle 22: 1-5-9-2-1
- Cycle 23: 1-8-6-7-1
- Cycle 24: 1-8-5-4-1
- Cycle 25: 3-0-4-7-3
- Cycle 26: 3-0-6-8-3
- Cycle 27: 6-7-4-5-6
- Cycle 28: 6-7-2-9-6
- Cycle 29: 6-8-5-4-6
- Cycle 30: 6-8-4-7-6
- Cycle 31: 8-5-1-9-8
- Cycle 32: 8-5-4-7-8
- Cycle 33: 8-6-7-1-8
- Cycle 34: 8-6-9-2-8
- Cycle 35: 0-3-2-9-0
- Cycle 36: 0-3-4-5-0
- Cycle 37: 0-6-7-4-0
- Cycle 38: 0-6-8-5-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, (2, 9), 4>
- <5, (1, 9), 7>
- <5, (4, 7), 6>
- <5, (1, 8), 9>
- <4, (9, 6), 7>
- <4, (5, 8), 1>
- <7, (6, 8), 4>
- <7, (1, 8), 6>
- <1, (8, 6), 7>
- <3, (2, 9), 0>
- <6, (9, 2), 7>
- <6, (7, 4), 8>
- <8, (7, 1), 6>
- <0, (3, 4), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 38 chordless 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [38].
