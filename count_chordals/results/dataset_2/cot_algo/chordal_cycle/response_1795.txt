Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (0, 9, 1, 3, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 9, 3, 2, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 4, 5, 3, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 4, 8, 6, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 6, 7, 5, 0)
- Cycle 6: (1, 9, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 1, 3, 5, 2)
- Cycle 8: (4, 5, 7, 8, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 10: (6, 4, 0, 8, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 with chord (1, 3): <1, (1, 3), 9, 0, 2>
- Cycle 2 with chord (3, 2): <2, (3, 2), 0, 4, 8>
- Cycle 3 with chord (4, 5): <3, (4, 5), 0, 6, 7>
- Cycle 4 with chord (8, 6): <4, (8, 6), 0, 4, 7>
- Cycle 5 with chord (6, 7): <5, (6, 7), 0, 4, 5>
- Cycle 6 with chord (1, 3): <6, (1, 3), 9, 5, 2>
- Cycle 7 with chord (1, 3): <7, (1, 3), 2, 5, 4>
- Cycle 8 with chord (7, 8): <8, (7, 8), 4, 5, 6>
- Cycle 9 with chord (6, 7): <9, (6, 7), 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle 10 with chord (4, 8): <10, (4, 8), 6, 0, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
