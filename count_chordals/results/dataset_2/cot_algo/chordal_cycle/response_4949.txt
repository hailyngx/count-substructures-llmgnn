Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 8, 5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 5, 4, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 3, 2, 0)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 7, 2, 3, 1)
- Cycle 6: (2, 3, 9, 8, 2)
- Cycle 7: (4, 9, 3, 1, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 9, 3, 4)
- Cycle 9: (5, 6, 9, 4, 5)
- Cycle 10: (7, 1, 4, 2, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (6, 4)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (3, 8)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (9, 1)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (1, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

So, the final answer is [0].
