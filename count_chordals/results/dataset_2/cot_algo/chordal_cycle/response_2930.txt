Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 10) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 16) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 16) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 14) (16, 19) (16, 4) (16, 7) (1, 12) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 0) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 17) (14, 12) (14, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-15-2-15-3
- Cycle 2: 3-18-10-11-3
- Cycle 3: 3-18-10-13-9-5-8-12-4-16-7-14-12-6-3
- Cycle 4: 3-18-10-13-9-5-8-12-1-12-14-7-16-4-12-4
- Cycle 5: 3-6-12-1-12-8-5-9-13-10-18-3

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <3, 18, 10, 13>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<3, 18, 10, 13>
