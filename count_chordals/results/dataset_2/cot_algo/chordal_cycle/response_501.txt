Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (17, 4) (17, 12) (10, 3) (10, 5) (15, 12) (13, 18) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 5) (9, 18) (9, 11) (19, 6) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: <4, 8, 6, 2, 4>
        - Cycle 2: <4, 8, 5, 16, 14, 4>
        - Cycle 3: <4, 18, 13, 3, 14, 4>
        - Cycle 4: <8, 6, 19, 6, 8>
        - Cycle 5: <2, 6, 13, 3, 2>
        - Cycle 6: <2, 11, 0, 14, 16, 2>
        - Cycle 7: <18, 13, 1, 16, 14, 18>
        - Cycle 8: <18, 9, 11, 0, 14, 18>
        - Cycle 9: <0, 11, 9, 18, 4, 0>
        - Cycle 10: <14, 16, 1, 13, 18, 14>
        - Cycle 11: <7, 12, 17, 4, 14, 3, 7>
        - Cycle 12: <12, 7, 3, 13, 18, 9, 11, 12>
        - Cycle 13: <12, 5, 8, 6, 2, 11, 12>
        - Cycle 14: <12, 15, 12>
        - Cycle 15: <17, 12, 5, 8, 4, 17>
        - Cycle 16: <1, 16, 14, 4, 17, 12, 15, 1>
        - Cycle 17: <10, 3, 13, 18, 9, 11, 2, 6, 10>
        - Cycle 18: <13, 1, 16, 5, 10, 3, 7, 12, 17, 13>
        - Cycle 19: <16, 5, 10, 3, 7, 12, 15, 1, 13, 16>
        - Cycle 20: <3, 13, 18, 9, 11, 2, 6, 8, 5, 3>

    Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Unique chordal 4-cycle: <4, 8, 6, 2, 4>, Chord: (6, 2)

    Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

    Therefore, the final answer is [1].
