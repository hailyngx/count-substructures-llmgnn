Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 6-10-9-14-6
        - Cycle 2: 6-10-9-7-6
        - Cycle 3: 6-13-9-7-6
        - Cycle 4: 6-13-2-14-6
        - Cycle 5: 6-3-5-12-6
        - Cycle 6: 6-3-7-9-6
        - Cycle 7: 6-3-0-8-6
        - Cycle 8: 6-11-8-0-6
        - Cycle 9: 6-11-14-2-6
        - Cycle 10: 6-11-12-5-6
        - Cycle 11: 10-1-4-11-10
        - Cycle 12: 10-1-14-2-10
        - Cycle 13: 10-2-14-11-10
        - Cycle 14: 10-2-13-6-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: 6-10-9-14-6 has a chord 9-14
        - Cycle 2: 6-10-9-7-6 has a chord 9-7
        - Cycle 3: 6-13-9-7-6 has a chord 9-7
        - Cycle 4: 6-13-2-14-6 has a chord 2-14
        - Cycle 5: 6-3-5-12-6 has a chord 5-12
        - Cycle 6: 6-3-7-9-6 has a chord 7-9
        - Cycle 7: 6-3-0-8-6 has a chord 0-8
        - Cycle 8: 6-11-8-0-6 has a chord 8-0
        - Cycle 9: 6-11-14-2-6 has a chord 14-2
        - Cycle 10: 6-11-12-5-6 has a chord 12-5
        - Cycle 11: 10-1-4-11-10 has a chord 1-4
        - Cycle 12: 10-1-14-2-10 has a chord 14-2
        - Cycle 13: 10-2-14-11-10 has a chord 14-11
        - Cycle 14: 10-2-13-6-10 has a chord 13-6

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
