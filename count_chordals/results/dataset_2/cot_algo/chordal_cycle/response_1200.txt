Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 11) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3)

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (4, 7, 1, 13, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 7, 12, 2, 4)
        - Cycle 3: (4, 11, 12, 5, 4)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 6, 5, 12, 4)
        - Cycle 5: (7, 12, 5, 2, 7)
        - Cycle 6: (7, 11, 12, 4, 7)
        - Cycle 7: (7, 13, 1, 11, 7)
        - Cycle 8: (6, 4, 11, 9, 6)
        - Cycle 9: (6, 5, 12, 2, 6)
        - Cycle 10: (6, 11, 7, 1, 6)

        - Cycle 13: (5, 2, 0, 14, 5)
        - Cycle 14: (2, 12, 5, 6, 2)
        - Cycle 15: (2, 10, 4, 11, 2)
        - Cycle 16: (2, 14, 5, 1, 2)
        - Cycle 17: (11, 12, 5, 6, 11)
        - Cycle 18: (11, 6, 4, 7, 11)
        - Cycle 19: (11, 7, 1, 13, 11)
        - Cycle 20: (1, 7, 4, 10, 1)
        - Cycle 21: (1, 13, 7, 12, 1)
        - Cycle 22: (1, 14, 5, 2, 1)
        - Cycle 23: (3, 6, 5, 12, 3)
        - Cycle 24: (3, 2, 12, 11, 3)
        - Cycle 25: (3, 14, 5, 2, 3)
        - Cycle 26: (14, 5, 6, 3, 14)
        - Cycle 27: (10, 4, 11, 1, 10)
        - Cycle 28: (10, 13, 7, 1, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Chordal cycle 1: <4, (7, 1), 13>
        - Chordal cycle 2: <4, (7, 12), 2>
        - Chordal cycle 3: <4, (11, 12), 5>
        - Chordal cycle 4: <4, (6, 5), 12>
        - Chordal cycle 5: <7, (12, 5), 2>
        - Chordal cycle 6: <7, (11, 12), 4>
        - Chordal cycle 7: <7, (1, 13), 11>
        - Chordal cycle 8: <6, (4, 11), 9>
        - Chordal cycle 9: <6, (5, 12), 2>
        - Chordal cycle 10: <6, (11, 7), 1>
        - Chordal cycle 11: <12, (5, 6), 3>
        - Chordal cycle 12: <12, (12, 5), 6>
        - Chordal cycle 13: <5, (2, 0), 14>
        - Chordal cycle 14: <2, (5, 12), 6>
        - Chordal cycle 15: <2, (4, 11), 10>
        - Chordal cycle 16: <2, (14, 5), 1>
        - Chordal cycle 17: <11, (5, 6), 12>
        - Chordal cycle 18: <11, (6, 4), 7>
        - Chordal cycle 19: <11, (1, 13), 7>
        - Chordal cycle 20: <1, (7, 4), 10>
        - Chordal cycle 21: <1, (13, 7), 12>
        - Chordal cycle 22: <1, (14, 5), 2>
        - Chordal cycle 23: <3, (6, 5), 12>
        - Chordal cycle 24: <3, (2, 12), 11>
        - Chordal cycle 25: <3, (14, 5), 2>
        - Chordal cycle 26: <14, (5, 6), 3>
        - Chordal cycle 27: <10, (4, 11), 1>
        - Chordal cycle 28: <10, (13, 7), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - As there are no chordless cycles, the final count is [0].
