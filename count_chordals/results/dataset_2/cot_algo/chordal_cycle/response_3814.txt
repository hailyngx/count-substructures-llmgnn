Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 11) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 5-9-3-13-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-1-7-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-0-4-5
- Cycle 4: 5-9-7-3-5
- Cycle 5: 5-6-1-7-5
- Cycle 6: 5-6-14-12-5
- Cycle 7: 5-6-11-4-5
- Cycle 8: 5-2-4-11-5
- Cycle 9: 5-2-12-14-5
- Cycle 10: 5-12-14-6-5
- Cycle 11: 5-12-2-4-5
- Cycle 12: 5-14-6-11-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has no chord.
- Cycle 8 has no chord.
- Cycle 9 has no chord.
- Cycle 10 has no chord.
- Cycle 11 has no chord.
- Cycle 12 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 12 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [12].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <5, 9, 3, 13>
- <5, 9, 1, 7>
- <5, 9, 0, 4>
- <5, 9, 7, 3>
- <5, 6, 1, 7>
- <5, 6, 14, 12>
- <5, 6, 11, 4>
- <5, 2, 4, 11>
- <5, 2, 12, 14>
- <5, 12, 14, 6>
- <5, 12, 2, 4>
- <5, 14, 6, 11>
