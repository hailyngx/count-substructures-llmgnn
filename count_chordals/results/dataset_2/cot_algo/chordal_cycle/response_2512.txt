Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 0, 2, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 6, 2, 1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 4, 2, 0, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 6, 2, 0, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 8, 3, 1, 5)
- Cycle 6: (9, 0, 2, 6, 3, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 0, 4, 7, 5, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 6, 3, 8, 9)
- Cycle 9: (6, 2, 4, 8, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 3, 8, 4, 6)
- Cycle 11: (1, 2, 6, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 3, 8, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 13: (4, 7, 5, 1, 3, 4)
- Cycle 14: (3, 8, 4, 7, 3)

Step 2:  
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has no chords.
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (9, 0)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (2, 4)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (6, 3)
- Cycle 11 has no chords.
- Cycle 12 has no chords.
- Cycle 13 has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 14 has one chord: (4, 7)

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal cycles found:  
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found.  

Therefore, the final answer is [5].  
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:  
<6, (9, 0), 2, 5>  
<7, (5, 9), 4, 1>  
<8, (9, 6), 3, 9>  
<9, (2, 4), 6, 2>  
<10, (6, 3), 8, 4>
