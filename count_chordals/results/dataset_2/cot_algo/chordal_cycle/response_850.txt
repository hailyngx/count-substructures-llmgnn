Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (8, 10, 11, 12)
        - Cycle 2: (10, 11, 12, 14)
        - Cycle 3: (9, 10, 11, 12)
        - Cycle 4: (10, 11, 2, 13)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 10, 11, 2)
        - Cycle 6: (4, 10, 9, 3)
        - Cycle 7: (4, 11, 12, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1: (8, 10, 11, 12) has one chord (10, 12) -> <8, (10, 12), 11>
        - Cycle 2: (10, 11, 12, 14) has one chord (11, 14) -> <10, (11, 14), 12>
        - Cycle 3: (9, 10, 11, 12) does not have exactly one chord
        - Cycle 4: (10, 11, 2, 13) does not have exactly one chord
        - Cycle 5: (4, 10, 11, 2) does not have exactly one chord
        - Cycle 6: (4, 10, 9, 3) does not have exactly one chord
        - Cycle 7: (4, 11, 12, 14) does not have exactly one chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        - We found 2 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final number is [2].

        The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        <8, (10, 12), 11>
        <10, (11, 14), 12>
