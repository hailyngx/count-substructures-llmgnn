Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 17) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 19) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 18) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 15) (0, 4) (14, 12) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 9) (19, 5) (19, 18) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 8) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 12) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 3) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 12) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 2) (3, 4) (3, 18) (2, 1) (2, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (4, 0) - (0, 4) - (4, 3) - (3, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 3) - (3, 4) - (4, 0) - (0, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 0) - (0, 4) - (4, 3) - (3, 18) - (18, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 6) - (6, 9) - (9, 7) - (7, 17) - (17, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 17) - (17, 7) - (7, 6) - (6, 7)
- Cycle 6: (6, 9) - (9, 17) - (17, 11) - (11, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 9) - (9, 17) - (17, 11) - (11, 10) - (10, 6)
- Cycle 8: (8, 13) - (13, 1) - (1, 9) - (9, 8)
- Cycle 9: (13, 1) - (1, 9) - (9, 17) - (17, 13)
- Cycle 10: (10, 11) - (11, 1) - (1, 9) - (9, 10)
- Cycle 11: (10, 11) - (11, 17) - (17, 9) - (9, 10)
- Cycle 12: (13, 1) - (1, 11) - (11, 17) - (17, 13)
- Cycle 13: (0, 4) - (4, 3) - (3, 18) - (18, 0)
- Cycle 14: (5, 11) - (11, 17) - (17, 5) - (5, 19)  
- Cycle 15: (1, 15) - (15, 11) - (11, 17) - (17, 1)  
- Cycle 16: (1, 15) - (15, 12) - (12, 16) - (16, 1)  
- Cycle 17: (18, 19) - (19, 5) - (5, 16) - (16, 18)  
- Cycle 18: (12, 15) - (15, 1) - (1, 9) - (9, 12)  
- Cycle 19: (16, 5) - (5, 11) - (11, 17) - (17, 16)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 3 has one chord: (4, 18)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (9, 11)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (9, 10)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (8, 9)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (10, 9)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (1, 17)
- Cycle 14 has one chord: (11, 5)
- Cycle 15 has one chord: (11, 17)
- Cycle 16 has one chord: (15, 16)
- Cycle 17 has one chord: (5, 16)
- Cycle 18 has one chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 19 has one chord: (5, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 8 chordless 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<4, 0, 3, (4, 18)>
<7, 6, 9, (9, 11)>
<7, 6, 10, (9, 10)>
<8, 13, 1, (8, 9)>
<10, 11, 1, (10, 9)>
<13, 1, 11, (1, 17)>
<5, 11, 17, (11, 5)>
<1, 15, 12, (15, 16)>
