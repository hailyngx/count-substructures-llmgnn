Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 6) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 7) (7, 12) (7, 27) (7, 6) (7, 13) (0, 22) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 20) (17, 8) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 3) (20, 5) (16, 28) (16, 24) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 26) (28, 27) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 4) (28, 15) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 22) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 4) (29, 9) (29, 11) (29, 18) (10, 14) (10, 22) (15, 28) (15, 18) (22, 0) (22, 8) (22, 10) (22, 19) (18, 29) (18, 15) (19, 22) (19, 11) (25, 9) (25, 6) (11, 29) (11, 19) (11, 24) (11, 26) (24, 16) (24, 11) (6, 12) (6, 7) (6, 25) (6, 26) (5, 20) (5, 23) (5, 21) (23, 14) (23, 5) (26, 16) (26, 11) (26, 6) (26, 21) (3, 27) (3, 20) (3, 4) (4, 28) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (1, 16) (1, 28) (1, 13) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 1) (21, 5) (21, 26) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (7, 12, 6, 25) with edges (7, 12), (12, 6), (6, 25), (25, 7)
- Cycle 2: (11, 26, 6, 25) with edges (11, 26), (26, 6), (6, 25), (25, 11)
- Cycle 3: (4, 3, 20, 5) with edges (4, 3), (3, 20), (20, 5), (5, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 3, 27, 7) with edges (4, 3), (3, 27), (27, 7), (7, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 3, 20, 17) with edges (4, 3), (3, 20), (20, 17), (17, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 28, 1, 16) with edges (4, 28), (28, 1), (1, 16), (16, 4)
- Cycle 7: (5, 21, 26, 11) with edges (5, 21), (21, 26), (26, 11), (11, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 has chord (12, 25) with cycle <7, (12, 25), 6, 25>
- Cycle 2 has chord (11, 6) with cycle <11, (11, 6), 25, 26>
- Cycle 4 has chord (3, 7) with cycle <4, 3, (3, 7), 4>
- Cycle 6 has chord (28, 16) with cycle <4, 28, (28, 16), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 

There are 3 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
