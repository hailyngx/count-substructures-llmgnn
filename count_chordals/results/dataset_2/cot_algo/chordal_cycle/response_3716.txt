Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (13, 6) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-5-9-12-6-0
- Cycle 2: 1-3-4-5-9-12-2-1
- Cycle 3: 2-7-10-3-1-14-2
- Cycle 4: 3-1-0-7-10-4-3
- Cycle 5: 4-12-9-5-8-4
- Cycle 6: 5-14-2-12-9-5
- Cycle 7: 6-12-4-3-6
- Cycle 8: 7-10-2-14-5-8-7

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord 0-6
- Cycle 2 has one chord 1-3
- Cycle 3 has one chord 1-14
- Cycle 4 has one chord 0-7
- Cycle 5 has one chord 4-8
- Cycle 6 has one chord 2-12
- Cycle 7 has one chord 3-4
- Cycle 8 has one chord 2-10

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <0, 6> (Cycle 1)
2. <1, 3> (Cycle 2)
3. <1, 14> (Cycle 3)
4. <0, 7> (Cycle 4)
5. <4, 8> (Cycle 5)
6. <2, 12> (Cycle 6)
7. <3, 4> (Cycle 7)
8. <2, 10> (Cycle 8)
