Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 10) (1, 14) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 2), (2, 4), (4, 5), (5, 8)
- Cycle 2: (5, 8), (8, 7), (7, 6), (6, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 6), (6, 10), (10, 4), (4, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 12), (12, 5), (5, 4), (4, 9)
- Cycle 5: (12, 11), (11, 9), (9, 13), (13, 12)
- Cycle 6: (9, 13), (13, 14), (14, 0), (0, 6)
- Cycle 7: (8, 7), (7, 3), (3, 4), (4, 8)
- Cycle 8: (3, 2), (2, 0), (0, 6), (6, 3)
- Cycle 9: (0, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 0)
- Cycle 10: (14, 0), (0, 10), (10, 6), (6, 14)
- Cycle 11: (13, 0), (0, 14), (14, 8), (8, 13)
- Cycle 12: (3, 10), (10, 1), (1, 14), (14, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1: <1, (5, 8), 1)>
- Cycle 2: <2, (8, 7), 2)>
- Cycle 5: <3, (9, 13), 5)>
- Cycle 6: <4, (13, 14), 6)>
- Cycle 8: <5, (3, 2), 8)>
- Cycle 10: <6, (14, 0), 10)>
- Cycle 12: <7, (3, 10), 12)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
