Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (16, 12) (16, 10) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 12) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 10) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 3) (9, 4) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 19) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 3-15-2-1-3
        - Cycle 2: 3-15-7-14-12-16-10-0-3
        - Cycle 3: 3-15-7-14-12-10-0-3
        - Cycle 4: 3-15-5-17-1-2-6-3
        - Cycle 5: 3-15-5-18-10-0-3
        - Cycle 6: 3-15-6-2-1-3
        - Cycle 7: 4-8-7-14-12-16-10-0-4
        - Cycle 8: 4-8-7-14-12-10-0-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: 3-15-2-1-3 has exactly one chord: (15, 1) -> <1, (15, 1), 2>
        - Cycle 2: 3-15-7-14-12-16-10-0-3 has no chord, is chordal
        - Cycle 3: 3-15-7-14-12-10-0-3 has no chord, is chordal
        - Cycle 4: 3-15-5-17-1-2-6-3 has exactly one chord: (15, 1) -> <2, (15, 1), 6>
        - Cycle 5: 3-15-5-18-10-0-3 has no chord, is chordal
        - Cycle 6: 3-15-6-2-1-3 has exactly one chord: (15, 1) -> <3, (15, 1), 6>
        - Cycle 7: 4-8-7-14-12-16-10-0-4 has no chord, is chordal
        - Cycle 8: 4-8-7-14-12-10-0-4 has no chord, is chordal

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        - Chordal cycles: 5
        - Number of unique chordal 4-cycles: [5]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        - <3, (15, 1), 6>
        - <1, (15, 1), 2>
