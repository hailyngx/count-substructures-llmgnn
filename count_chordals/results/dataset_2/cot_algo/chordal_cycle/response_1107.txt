Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 7, 1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 8, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 7, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 7, 8, 6, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 8, 4, 0, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 6, 2, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 0, 5, 2, 4)
- Cycle 9: (8, 6, 2, 3, 8)
- Cycle 10: (0, 5, 1, 6, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, (7, 9), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 9 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
