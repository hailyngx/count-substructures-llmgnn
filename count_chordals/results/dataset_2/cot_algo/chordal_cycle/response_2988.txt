- Cycle 18: (3, 12, 1, 5)
- Cycle 19: (4, 5, 1, 10)
- Cycle 20: (4, 5, 11, 9)
- Cycle 21: (4, 6, 0, 3)
- Cycle 22: (4, 6, 2, 8)
- Cycle 23: (4, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 24: (4, 9, 8, 2)
- Cycle 25: (4, 9, 11, 5)
- Cycle 26: (5, 11, 9, 3)
- Cycle 27: (6, 0, 3, 1)
- Cycle 28: (6, 0, 14, 8)
- Cycle 29: (6, 2, 8, 9)
- Cycle 30: (6, 2, 1, 5)
- Cycle 31: (6, 10, 1, 5)
- Cycle 32: (6, 10, 13, 8)
- Cycle 33: (7, 8, 9, 4)
- Cycle 34: (7, 8, 13, 10)
- Cycle 35: (7, 13, 10, 1)
- Cycle 36: (8, 13, 10, 1)
- Cycle 37: (9, 11, 5, 1)
- Cycle 38: (9, 11, 5, 4)
- Cycle 39: (9, 11, 1, 3)
- Cycle 40: (10, 0, 3, 1)
- Cycle 41: (10, 0, 6, 4)
- Cycle 42: (10, 13, 8, 2)
- Cycle 43: (11, 5, 1, 10)
- Cycle 44: (12, 7, 8, 9)
- Cycle 45: (12, 7, 13, 10)
- Cycle 46: (12, 14, 8, 2)
- Cycle 47: (13, 7, 12, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 9, 8>
- <1, 3, 0, 6>
- <1, 3, 12, 7>
- <1, 3, 12, 14>
- <1, 5, 4, 6>
- <1, 5, 4, 9>
- <1, 10, 13, 8>
- <1, 10, 0, 6>
- <1, 12, 14, 8>
- <1, 14, 8, 2>
- <3, 9, 8, 14>
- <4, 5, 1, 10>
- <4, 5, 11, 9>
- <4, 6, 2, 8>
- <4, 9, 11, 5>
- <6, 2, 1, 5>
- <6, 10, 1, 5>
- <6, 10, 13, 8>
- <7, 8, 13, 10>
- <9, 11, 1, 3>
- <10, 0, 3, 1>
- <10, 13, 8, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 22 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [22].
