Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-1-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-9-2-6-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-2-5-0
- Cycle 4: 0-5-7-4-0
- Cycle 5: 0-8-3-1-0
- Cycle 6: 1-6-2-9-1
- Cycle 7: 3-8-2-9-3
- Cycle 8: 4-1-7-5-4
- Cycle 9: 4-7-0-9-4
- Cycle 10: 5-7-1-3-5
- Cycle 11: 7-5-0-2-7
- Cycle 12: 8-0-3-9-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (2, 5)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (7, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 10 chordless cycles.
Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 1, 6, 2>
<0, 5, 7, 4>
<0, 8, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 8, 2>
<2, 9, 6, 0>
<3, 1, 9, 2>
<4, 7, 0, 9>
<5, 7, 1, 3>
<7, 5, 0, 2>
<4, 1, 7, 5>
