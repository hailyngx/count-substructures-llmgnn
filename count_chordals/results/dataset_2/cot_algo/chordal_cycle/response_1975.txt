Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 2) (22, 19) (22, 27) (22, 15) (22, 29) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 7) (15, 22) (15, 14) (20, 27) (6, 16) (6, 11) (0, 25) (0, 26) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 9) (14, 12) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 5) (26, 0) (26, 2) (26, 16) (29, 22) (29, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (19, 22) (19, 4) (19, 7) (16, 6) (16, 26) (16, 5) (23, 21) (23, 18) (23, 9) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 8) (5, 21) (5, 24) (5, 8) (5, 16) (2, 13) (2, 26) (2, 4) (18, 23) (18, 27) (18, 25) (4, 10) (4, 24) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 25) (27, 22) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 14) (27, 18) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 25) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 23) (9, 7) (25, 0) (25, 18) (25, 4) (25, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        1. (6, 16, 26, 0)
        2. (10, 4, 24, 5)
        3. (10, 4, 19, 7)
        4. (10, 4, 2, 26)
        5. (10, 3, 8, 5)
        6. (10, 3, 17, 7)
        7. (10, 3, 8, 1)
        8. (10, 3, 17, 9)
        9. (10, 3, 8, 21)
        10. (10, 3, 17, 3)
        11. (10, 3, 17, 9)
        12. (10, 4, 24, 25)
        13. (10, 4, 19, 22)
        14. (10, 4, 2, 13)
        15. (14, 15, 22, 29)
        16. (14, 15, 22, 19)
        17. (14, 15, 22, 27)
        18. (14, 15, 22, 21)
        19. (14, 15, 22, 29)
        20. (14, 15, 22, 19)
        21. (14, 15, 22, 27)
        22. (14, 15, 22, 21)
        23. (14, 15, 22, 29)
        24. (14, 15, 22, 19)
        25. (14, 15, 22, 27)
        26. (14, 15, 22, 21)
        27. (14, 15, 22, 29)
        28. (14, 15, 22, 19)
        29. (14, 15, 22, 27)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        <14, (22, 29), 15, 22>
        <14, (22, 19), 15, 22>
        <14, (22, 27), 15, 22>
        <14, (22, 21), 15, 22>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        
        [4]

Therefore, there are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
