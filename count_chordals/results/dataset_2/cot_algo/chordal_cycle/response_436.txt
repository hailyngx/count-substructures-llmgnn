Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<0, 7, 2, 5>  
<0, 7, 2, 9>  
<0, 7, 1, 9>  
<0, 7, 1, 4>  
<0, 2, 5, 3>  
<1, 6, 3, 0>  
<1, 6, 3, 5>  
<1, 4, 9, 6>  
<1, 4, 9, 5>  
<1, 4, 8, 6>  
<1, 4, 8, 0>  
<1, 8, 0, 7>  
<1, 8, 0, 2>  
<2, 7, 0, 8>  
<2, 7, 0, 3>  
<3, 5, 2, 0>  
<3, 5, 2, 7>  
<4, 8, 0, 7>  
<4, 8, 0, 2>  
<5, 2, 0, 3>  
<6, 9, 5, 3>  
<6, 9, 5, 2>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<0, 7, 2, 5> has a chord (7, 2)  
<0, 7, 2, 9> has a chord (7, 9)  
<1, 6, 3, 0> has a chord (6, 3)  
<1, 6, 3, 5> has a chord (6, 5)  
<1, 4, 9, 6> has a chord (9, 6)  
<1, 4, 9, 5> has a chord (4, 5)  
<1, 4, 8, 6> has a chord (4, 8)  
<1, 8, 0, 7> has a chord (0, 7)  
<2, 7, 0, 8> has a chord (7, 8)  
<3, 5, 2, 7> has a chord (5, 7)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are a total of [9] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
