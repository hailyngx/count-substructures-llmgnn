Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (14, 15) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (18, 9) (18, 12) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (0, 17) (0, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 19) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 8) (15, 10) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 6) (6, 16) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: We will list all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: (16, 15, 14, 15)
- Cycle 2: (16, 15, 8, 15)
- Cycle 3: (16, 6, 2, 6)
- Cycle 4: (16, 6, 1, 6)
- Cycle 5: (16, 6, 10, 6)
- Cycle 6: (16, 3, 4, 3)
- Cycle 7: (16, 3, 10, 3)
- Cycle 8: (16, 3, 19, 3)
- Cycle 9: (15, 14, 15, 16)
- Cycle 10: (15, 8, 15, 16)
- Cycle 11: (15, 8, 9, 17)
- Cycle 12: (15, 8, 10, 3)
- Cycle 13: (15, 10, 15, 16)
- Cycle 14: (15, 10, 3, 4)
- Cycle 15: (15, 10, 6, 1)
- Cycle 16: (15, 10, 6, 16)
- Cycle 17: (14, 15, 8, 15)
- Cycle 18: (8, 9, 17, 1)
- Cycle 19: (8, 9, 17, 0)
- Cycle 20: (8, 9, 2, 6)
- Cycle 21: (8, 15, 16, 3)
- Cycle 22: (8, 15, 10, 6)
- Cycle 23: (8, 15, 10, 3)
- Cycle 24: (9, 17, 1, 6)
- Cycle 25: (9, 17, 0, 13)
- Cycle 26: (9, 17, 0, 13)
- Cycle 27: (15, 16, 6, 2)
- Cycle 28: (16, 3, 4, 7)
- Cycle 29: (16, 6, 1, 12)
- Cycle 30: (16, 6, 10, 4)
- Cycle 31: (16, 3, 19, 1)
- Cycle 32: (16, 3, 19, 5)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <16, 15, 14, 15> has one chord (15, 8)
- <16, 6, 2, 6> has one chord (6, 1)
- <15, 8, 15, 16> has one chord (8, 9)
- <16, 6, 1, 6> has one chord (6, 2)
- <16, 3, 4, 3> has one chord (3, 10)
- <15, 10, 15, 16> has one chord (10, 6)
- <8, 9, 17, 0> has one chord (9, 2)
- <9, 17, 1, 6> has one chord (17, 0)
- <16, 3, 19, 1> has one chord (19, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
1. <16, 15, 14, 15>
2. <16, 6, 2, 6>
3. <15, 8, 15, 16>
4. <16, 6, 1, 6>
5. <16, 3, 4, 3>
6. <15, 10, 15, 16>
7. <8, 9, 17, 0>
8. <9, 17, 1, 6>
9. <16, 3, 19, 1>
