Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 4-7-2-5-4
        - Cycle 2: 4-9-1-6-4
        - Cycle 3: 4-0-5-6-4
        - Cycle 4: 4-3-2-7-4
        - Cycle 5: 7-2-5-6-7
        - Cycle 6: 8-9-1-6-8
        - Cycle 7: 8-0-5-6-8
        - Cycle 8: 5-6-1-9-5
        - Cycle 9: 5-0-8-1-5
        - Cycle 10: 0-4-7-2-0
        - Cycle 11: 0-5-6-3-0
        - Cycle 12: 1-6-3-5-1
        - Cycle 13: 2-5-0-8-2
        - Cycle 14: 3-6-1-9-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Chordal 4-cycles found:
        - <4, (2, 5), 7)> 
        - <4, (1, 9), 6)> 
        - <4, (0, 5), 6)> 
        - <4, (2, 7), 3)> 
        - <7, (5, 6), 2)> 
        - <8, (1, 6), 9)> 
        - <8, (0, 5), 6)> 
        - <5, (1, 9), 6)> 
        - <5, (0, 8), 1)> 
        - <0, (7, 2), 4)> 
        - <0, (6, 3), 5)> 
        - <1, (3, 5), 6)> 
        - <2, (0, 8), 5)> 
        - <3, (1, 9), 6)> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 14 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [14].
