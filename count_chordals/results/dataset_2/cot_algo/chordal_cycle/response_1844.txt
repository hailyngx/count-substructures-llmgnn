Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 0, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 0, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 1, 6, 4, 9)
- Cycle 5: (4, 2, 3, 1, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (0, 9)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 3 has two chords: (0, 9) and (7, 1)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 5 is chordless

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 1 chordless cycle.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, 3, 1, 4>.
