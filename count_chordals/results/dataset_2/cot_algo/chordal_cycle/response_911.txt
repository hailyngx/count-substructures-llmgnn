Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 5) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 9) (17, 23) (3, 25) (3, 29) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 15) (18, 22) (18, 14) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 5) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 8) (23, 2) (15, 25) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 11) (20, 17) (20, 11) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 27) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 10) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 4) (26, 19) (26, 10) (26, 4) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 0) (29, 17) (29, 3) (29, 6) (4, 1) (4, 26) (4, 24) (27, 5) (27, 28) (27, 16) (0, 19) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 21) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 2) (21, 6) (21, 0) (21, 11) (16, 27) (16, 0) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 10) (9, 17) (9, 15) (28, 13) (28, 27) (10, 6) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 12) (24, 4) (24, 7) (11, 15) (11, 20) (11, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 14, 5, 8, 3, 25, 15, 9, 17, 23, 14)
- Cycle 2: (1, 14, 5, 27, 28, 13, 22, 18, 14)
- Cycle 3: (1, 2, 7, 0, 19, 26, 4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 4, 26, 10, 2, 22, 13, 28, 27, 16, 0, 21, 11, 20, 17, 29, 6, 21)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1: No chords
- Cycle 2: Chord found: (13, 18)
- Cycle 3: No chords
- Cycle 4: No chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordless cycles: [3]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 14, 5, 8, (3, 25), 15, 9, 17, 23, 14>
<1, 2, 7, 0, (19, 26), 4, 1>
<1, 4, 26, 10, 2, 22, 13, 28, 27, 16, 0, 21, 11, 20, 17, 29, 6, 21>
