Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 4 - 6 - 1 - 5 (Chords: 4-1)
- Cycle 2: 5 - 3 - 1 - 4 - 5 (Chords: 3-4)
- Cycle 3: 9 - 6 - 1 - 3 - 9 (Chords: 6-3)
- Cycle 4: 9 - 3 - 1 - 6 - 9 (Chords: 3-6)
- Cycle 5: 4 - 6 - 3 - 1 - 4 (Chords: 6-1)
- Cycle 6: 5 - 4 - 8 - 2 - 5 (Chords: 4-8)
- Cycle 7: 5 - 3 - 9 - 6 - 5 (Chords: 3-9)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, there are 5 chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (4, 1), 5>
- Chordal cycle 2: <3, (3, 4), 5>
- Chordal cycle 3: <6, (6, 3), 9>
- Chordal cycle 4: <9, (3, 6), 1>
- Chordal cycle 5: <4, (4, 8), 5>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [2].
