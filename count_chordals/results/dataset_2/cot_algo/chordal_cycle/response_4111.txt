Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 4) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 4) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 14) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 5, 0, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 3: (3, 7, 2, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 7, 8, 3)
- Cycle 5: (5, 0, 3, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 14, 8, 5)
- Cycle 7: (0, 7, 2, 0)
- Cycle 8: (0, 7, 3, 0)
- Cycle 9: (7, 2, 1, 7)
- Cycle 10: (7, 8, 9, 7)
- Cycle 11: (7, 8, 14, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 13, 2, 7)
- Cycle 13: (8, 14, 12, 8)
- Cycle 14: (2, 1, 3, 2)
- Cycle 15: (2, 7, 8, 2)
- Cycle 16: (2, 10, 6, 2)
- Cycle 17: (2, 13, 7, 2)
- Cycle 18: (12, 14, 8, 12)
- Cycle 19: (12, 6, 10, 12)
- Cycle 20: (14, 8, 5, 14)
- Cycle 21: (14, 5, 3, 14)
- Cycle 22: (14, 4, 2, 14)
- Cycle 23: (14, 4, 9, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycle found is: 
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, (0, 5), 1> with chords 0 and 5.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 22 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
