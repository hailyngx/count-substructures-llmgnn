Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 6) (8, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 18) (13, 1) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 18) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 6) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 19) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 12) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are four cycles of length 4 in this graph:

1. (11, 16, 3, 2)
2. (11, 14, 4, 9)
3. (16, 12, 2, 3)
4. (1, 5, 17, 10)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

1. Cycle (11, 16, 3, 2) has chord (3, 16)
2. Cycle (11, 14, 4, 9) has chord (14, 9)
3. Cycle (16, 12, 2, 3) has chord (12, 16)
4. Cycle (1, 5, 17, 10) has chord (5, 17)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<Chordal 4-cycle 1: (11, 16), (3, 2)>
<Chordal 4-cycle 2: (11, 14), (9, 4)>
<Chordal 4-cycle 3: (16, 12), (2, 3)>
<Chordal 4-cycle 4: (1, 5), (17, 10)>
