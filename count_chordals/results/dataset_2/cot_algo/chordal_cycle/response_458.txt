Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 19) (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 14) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 12) (20, 23) (20, 28) (25, 13) (25, 26) (25, 23) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 1) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 15) (8, 21) (8, 6) (8, 3) (26, 25) (26, 2) (7, 17) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 5) (9, 23) (29, 5) (29, 21) (3, 8) (3, 21) (3, 6) (21, 8) (21, 29) (21, 3) (21, 24) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 3) (6, 1) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 2) (19, 22) (19, 24) (19, 27) (10, 27) (27, 19) (27, 10) (27, 17) (14, 16) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 23) (17, 7) (17, 27) (17, 28) (17, 5) (28, 20) (28, 17) (28, 24) (28, 5) (24, 21) (24, 19) (24, 28) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 9) (23, 4) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 17) (5, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (16, 11, 4, 23, 20, 28, 17, 5, 15, 16)
- Cycle 2: (16, 11, 5, 29, 21, 8, 6, 15, 16)
- Cycle 3: (16, 11, 5, 29, 21, 24, 19, 22, 18, 16)
- Cycle 4: (16, 11, 5, 29, 21, 24, 28, 20, 23, 16)
- Cycle 5: (16, 11, 5, 29, 21, 24, 19, 27, 10, 27, 17, 5, 16)
- Cycle 6: (16, 11, 5, 17, 28, 20, 23, 25, 26, 2, 12, 16)
- Cycle 7: (16, 11, 5, 17, 28, 20, 23, 4, 11, 16)
- Cycle 8: (16, 11, 5, 17, 27, 19, 22, 18, 16)
- Cycle 9: (16, 14, 1, 6, 18, 22, 19, 24, 21, 29, 5, 17, 27, 10, 27, 19, 28, 24, 21, 8, 6, 15, 16)
- Cycle 10: (16, 14, 1, 6, 18, 22, 19, 27, 10, 27, 19, 24, 28, 20, 23, 5, 11, 4, 23, 20, 28, 17, 5, 15, 2, 12, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: <1, (4, 23), 2>
- Cycle 2: <1, (5, 29), 6>
- Cycle 3: <1, (5, 29), 2>
- Cycle 4: <1, (5, 29), 20>
- Cycle 5: <1, (5, 29), 10>
- Cycle 6: <1, (17, 28), 2>
- Cycle 7: <1, (17, 28), 11>
- Cycle 8: <1, (17, 27), 2>
- Cycle 9: <1, (17, 27), 5>
- Cycle 10: <1, (5, 11), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There are a total of [5] chordal 4-cycles found.
