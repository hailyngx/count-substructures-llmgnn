Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 1) (15, 8) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (16, 1) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 2) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 6) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 13) (3, 2) (3, 6) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 19) (18, 6) (13, 0) (13, 19) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycle of length 4 in this graph is <4, 5, 2, 3>.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The cycle <4, 5, 2, 3> has one chord: (4, 2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 1 chordless cycle found.

Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, 5, 2, 3>, with one chord (4, 2).
