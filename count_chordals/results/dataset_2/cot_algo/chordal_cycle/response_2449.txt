Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 0) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 18) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 19) (7, 18) (0, 13) (0, 3) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 2) (9, 16) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- <11, 16, 2, 4>
- <8, 14, 6, 10>
- <8, 6, 10, 5>
- <13, 12, 8, 14>
- <13, 4, 2, 12>
- <17, 1, 18, 7>
- <17, 15, 19, 7>
- <17, 2, 12, 13>
- <17, 15, 13, 4>
- <15, 13, 0, 3>
- <15, 17, 3, 0>
- <16, 17, 1, 18>
- <16, 9, 14, 8>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <11, 16, 2, 4> has a chord (16, 2)
- <8, 14, 6, 10> has a chord (14, 6)
- <8, 6, 10, 5> has a chord (6, 10)
- <13, 12, 8, 14> has a chord (12, 8)
- <13, 4, 2, 12> has a chord (4, 12)
- <17, 1, 18, 7> has a chord (1, 18)
- <17, 15, 19, 7> has a chord (15, 7)
- <17, 2, 12, 13> has a chord (2, 13)
- <17, 15, 13, 4> has a chord (15, 4)
- <15, 13, 0, 3> has a chord (13, 3)
- <15, 17, 3, 0> has a chord (17, 3)
- <16, 17, 1, 18> has a chord (17, 1)
- <16, 9, 14, 8> has a chord (9, 14)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
