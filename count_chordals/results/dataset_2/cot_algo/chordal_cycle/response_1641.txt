Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (17, 5) (17, 7) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 13) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 11) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 11) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 10) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (18, 1) (18, 5) (18, 0) (12, 15) (12, 0) (12, 11) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 19) (11, 15) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 15 - 10 - 13 - 3 - 15
- Cycle 2: 15 - 11 - 12 - 0 - 15

Step 2: Check for chords:
- For Cycle 1, there is a chord 10-3, making it a chordal 4-cycle <15, (10, 3), 13>.
- For Cycle 2, there is no chord, making it a chordless 4-cycle <15, 11, 12, 0>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
