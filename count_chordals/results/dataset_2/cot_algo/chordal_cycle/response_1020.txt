Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 7, 11, 4, 10, 7, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 7, 10, 13, 5, 8, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 9, 0, 4, 10, 6, 3, 8, 5, 13, 12, 9, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Checking Cycle 1: (1, 7, 11, 4, 10, 7, 1) - This cycle has one chord (4, 10).
- Checking Cycle 2: (1, 7, 10, 13, 5, 8, 3, 1) - This cycle has one chord (7, 10).
- Checking Cycle 3: (2, 9, 0, 4, 10, 6, 3, 8, 5, 13, 12, 9, 2) - This cycle has one chord (4, 12).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- Cycle 1: <1, 7, 11, (4, 10), 7, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 7, (10, 13), 5, 8, 3, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 9, 0, (4, 10), 6, 3, 8, 5, 13, 12, 9, 2>
