Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 3) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 18) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 18) (16, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 12) (11, 0) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 2) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 11) (15, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 6, 15)
- Cycle 2: (5, 16, 6, 4)
- Cycle 3: (5, 17, 10, 4)
- Cycle 4: (9, 3, 17, 10)
- Cycle 5: (10, 18, 19, 6)
- Cycle 6: (10, 1, 8, 18)
- Cycle 7: (1, 12, 19, 6)
- Cycle 8: (1, 8, 14, 19)
- Cycle 9: (1, 0, 7, 18)
- Cycle 10: (0, 11, 12, 1)
- Cycle 11: (0, 2, 14, 13)
- Cycle 12: (7, 18, 10, 1)
- Cycle 13: (8, 18, 10, 17)
- Cycle 14: (16, 5, 17, 10)
- Cycle 15: (16, 5, 4, 2)
- Cycle 16: (0, 11, 12, 19)
- Cycle 17: (3, 2, 0, 7)
- Cycle 18: (3, 13, 14, 8)
- Cycle 19: (3, 17, 10, 1)
- Cycle 20: (3, 9, 6, 4)
- Cycle 21: (11, 0, 2, 14)
- Cycle 22: (13, 3, 9, 6)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (5-4), 10, 17>
- <2, (5-16), 4, 6>
- <3, (5-17), 10, 4>
- <4, 9, (3-17), 10>
- <5, 10, (18-19), 6>
- <6, 10, (1-8), 18>
- <7, 1, (12-19), 6>
- <8, 1, (8-14), 19>
- <9, 1, (0-7), 18>
- <10, 0, (11-12), 1>
- <11, 0, (2-14), 13>
- <12, 7, (18-10), 1>
- <13, 8, (18-10), 17>
- <14, (16-5), 17, 10>
- <15, (16-5), 4, 2>
- <16, 0, (11-12), 19>
- <17, (3-2), 0, 7>
- <18, 3, (13-14), 8>
- <19, 3, (17-10), 1>
- <20, 9, (3-6), 4>
- <21, 11, (0-2), 14>
- <22, 13, (3-9), 6>

Step 3:
There are 22 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the answer is [22].
