Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5-6-3-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-4-6-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-9-2-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-0-9-5
- Cycle 5: 5-4-3-6-5
- Cycle 6: 6-5-2-6
- Cycle 7: 6-4-3-7-6
- Cycle 8: 6-2-9-1-6
- Cycle 9: 8-5-1-9-8
- Cycle 10: 9-1-0-5-9
- Cycle 11: 9-2-5-0-9
- Cycle 12: 3-6-2-9-3
- Cycle 13: 3-7-9-2-3
- Cycle 14: 7-6-3-4-7

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (forming a chordal 4-cycle) are:
- <6, (3, 4), 5>
- <5, (1, 9), 8>
- <1, (0, 9), 5>
- <9, (2, 5), 0>
- <3, (6, 2), 9>
- <7, (3, 9), 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we have [6].
