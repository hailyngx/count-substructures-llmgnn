Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph. These include:
1. Cycle 5-9-6-5
2. Cycle 4-7-3-1-4
3. Cycle 4-2-7-8-4
4. Cycle 5-2-6-9-5
5. Cycle 8-3-7-2-8

Step 2:
After checking each cycle, we find that the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4-2-7-8-4 has one chord (2, 8).

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, (2, 8)>
