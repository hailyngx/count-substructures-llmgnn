Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 6 - 4 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 6 - 2 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 6 - 3 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 7 - 3 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 5: 5 - 7 - 2 - 9 - 5

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 <5, 6, 4, 1>: Chord: (6, 1)
- Cycle 2 <5, 6, 2, 1>: Chord: (6, 2)
- Cycle 3 <5, 6, 3, 4>: Chord: (6, 3)
- Cycle 4 <5, 7, 3, 4>: Chord: (7, 4)
- Cycle 5 <5, 7, 2, 9>: Chord: (7, 9)

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [0]
The graph does not contain any chordal 4-cycles.
