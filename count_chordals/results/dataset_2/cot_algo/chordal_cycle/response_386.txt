Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 19) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 18) (4, 16) (4, 18) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 15) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 2) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 2) (19, 9) (19, 12) (19, 2) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 19) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (8, 16) (8, 3) (6, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-9-16-4-3
- Cycle 2: 3-10-7-17-3
- Cycle 3: 7-0-5-1-7
- Cycle 4: 11-15-1-5-11
- Cycle 5: 11-15-6-2-11
- Cycle 6: 11-15-2-17-11
- Cycle 7: 16-9-10-3-16
- Cycle 8: 16-9-19-12-16
- Cycle 9: 16-4-18-14-16
- Cycle 10: 16-4-18-11-16

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <3, (9, 16), 4>
- Cycle 2: <3, (10, 7), 17>
- Cycle 3: <7, (0, 5), 1>
- Cycle 4: <11, (15, 1), 5>
- Cycle 5: <11, (15, 6), 2>
- Cycle 6: <11, (15, 2), 17>
- Cycle 7: <16, (9, 10), 3>
- Cycle 8: <16, (9, 19), 12>
- Cycle 9: <16, (4, 18), 14>
- Cycle 10: <16, (4, 18), 11>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [10].
