Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 8) (15, 24) (15, 21) (27, 4) (27, 23) (4, 27) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (23, 27) (23, 1) (23, 9) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 1) (20, 0) (20, 24) (21, 15) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 11) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 21) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 2) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 8) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 24) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 5) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 19) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 25) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 25) (17, 13) (17, 6) (25, 12) (25, 14) (25, 17) (25, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 25) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 16) (6, 19) (6, 17) (6, 16) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 24) (16, 6) (1, 23) (1, 0) (2, 11) (9, 4) (9, 23) (9, 21) (29, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <15, 21, 11, 24>
- Cycle 2: <4, 7, 10, 21>
- Cycle 3: <4, 7, 18, 26>
- Cycle 4: <4, 12, 17, 25>
- Cycle 5: <4, 9, 23, 1>
- Cycle 6: <7, 10, 19, 5>
- Cycle 7: <11, 21, 10, 7>
- Cycle 8: <15, 21, 10, 7>
- Cycle 9: <16, 6, 17, 25>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <4, 7, 10, 21> has one chord: (7, 21) [Chordal cycle: <4, (7, 21), 10, 21>]

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There was 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Final Answer: [1]
