Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (12, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 11, 2, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 14, 0, 1, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 0, 14, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 11, 2, 10, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 3, 0, 1, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 13, 4, 8, 9)
- Cycle 8: (4, 7, 10, 1, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 13, 9, 11, 4)
- Cycle 10: (7, 12, 11, 2, 7)
- Cycle 11: (7, 10, 2, 6, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 1, 0, 14, 7)
- Cycle 13: (8, 13, 9, 4, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 10, 7, 1, 8)
- Cycle 15: (8, 6, 2, 11, 8)
- Cycle 16: (13, 11, 2, 6, 13)
- Cycle 17: (12, 7, 10, 2, 12)
- Cycle 18: (0, 14, 6, 2, 0)
- Cycle 19: (0, 3, 2, 11, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<5, (3, 14), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 18 chordless cycles. Thus, the final answer is [18].
