Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (7, 21) (7, 26) (7, 13) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 29) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 23) (11, 28) (11, 22) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 23) (1, 22) (3, 9) (3, 1) (22, 11) (22, 1) (22, 23) (23, 10) (23, 1) (23, 22) (23, 24) (5, 14) (5, 20) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 29) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 20) (18, 13) (19, 4) (19, 15) (26, 7) (26, 16) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 12) (20, 5) (20, 18) (29, 21) (29, 0) (24, 6) (24, 23) (24, 8) (24, 27) (12, 28) (12, 25) (12, 8) (16, 26) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 4) (15, 19) (17, 6) (17, 27) (25, 12) (25, 8) (8, 21) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 12) (8, 25) (2, 4) (2, 27) (27, 24) (27, 17) (27, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1:  
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 3, 1, 10, 18, 4, 15, 21, 7, 13)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 3, 1, 10, 18, 13, 7, 21, 15)
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 3, 1, 10, 18, 20, 5, 14, 0, 28)
- Cycle 4: (6, 9, 3, 1, 23, 22, 11, 28, 12, 8, 21)
- Cycle 5: (6, 9, 3, 1, 23, 10, 18, 13, 7, 21)
- Cycle 6: (6, 9, 3, 22, 1, 10, 18, 4, 15, 21)
- Cycle 7: (6, 17, 27, 24, 8, 12, 28, 0, 14, 5, 20)
- Cycle 8: (6, 17, 27, 24, 8, 21, 29, 0, 14, 5, 20)
- Cycle 9: (6, 24, 23, 10, 18, 13, 7, 21, 15, 4)
- Cycle 10: (9, 3, 22, 1, 10, 18, 4, 15, 21, 7)
- Cycle 11: (9, 15, 4, 18, 20, 5, 14, 0, 28, 12)
- Cycle 12: (9, 15, 4, 18, 10, 23, 24, 27, 17, 6)
- Cycle 13: (17, 6, 9, 15, 21, 7, 13, 10, 18, 4)
- Cycle 14: (17, 6, 9, 15, 21, 8, 12, 28, 11, 22)
- Cycle 15: (17, 6, 24, 23, 10, 18, 13, 7, 21)
- Cycle 16: (27, 24, 23, 10, 18, 4, 15, 21, 7)
- Cycle 17: (27, 24, 23, 1, 10, 18, 4, 15, 21)
- Cycle 18: (27, 24, 23, 1, 22, 11, 28, 0, 14)
- Cycle 19: (27, 17, 6, 9, 3, 1, 23, 24, 8)

Step 2:  
The cycles with exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (10, 18), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (4, 27), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (1, 23), 22>

Step 3:  
Count the number of chordless cycles found: [16]

<1, (10, 18), 4>
<2, (4, 27), 17>
<3, (1, 23), 22>
