Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <1, (2, 24), 1, 27)>
- <4, (2, 9), 28, 9>
- <4, (25, 18), 5, 18>
- <27, (0, 13), 6, 27>
- <27, (4, 16), 3, 27>
- <27, (13, 10), 21, 27>
- <27, (16, 29), 12, 27>
- <27, (16, 3), 7, 27>
- <27, (2, 24), 1, 27>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final count is [9].
