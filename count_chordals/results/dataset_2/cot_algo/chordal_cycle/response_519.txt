Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-4-7-10-6-11-5-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-4-3-1-5-0
        - Cycle 3: 1-3-4-7-13-12-1
        - Cycle 4: 1-3-13-7-4-11-12-1
        - Cycle 5: 1-3-13-2-9-12-1
        - Cycle 6: 1-5-11-6-10-14-1

Step 2: Checking for chordal cycles:
        - Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (6, 10)
        - Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (4, 3)
        - Cycle 3 is not a chordal 4-cycle
        - Cycle 4 is not a chordal 4-cycle
        - Cycle 5 is not a chordal 4-cycle
        - Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (6, 10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <0, (6, 10), 7>
        <2, (4, 3), 1>
        <4, (6, 10), 11>
