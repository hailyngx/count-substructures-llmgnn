Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle with vertices (5, 7, 4, 9)
- Cycle with vertices (5, 7, 0, 9)
- Cycle with vertices (4, 7, 6, 1)
- Cycle with vertices (4, 7, 3, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle (5, 7, 4, 9) has a chord (4, 9), making it <5, (4, 9), 7>
- Cycle (5, 7, 0, 9) has a chord (0, 9), making it <5, (0, 9), 7>
- Cycle (4, 7, 6, 1) has a chord (6, 1), making it <4, (6, 1), 7>
- Cycle (4, 7, 3, 8) has a chord (3, 8), making it <4, (3, 8), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Since all cycles found have chords, there are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
