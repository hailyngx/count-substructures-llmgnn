Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 10) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 18) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 14) (17, 19) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 19) (3, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 15) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 19) (18, 13) (18, 12) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 3) (19, 1) (4, 13) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 12) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (3, 11, 16, 15)
- Cycle 2: (0, 9, 10, 14)
- Cycle 3: (0, 9, 10, 16)
- Cycle 4: (0, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 5: (0, 9, 6, 5, 3)
- Cycle 6: (0, 9, 6, 5, 1)
- Cycle 7: (0, 9, 10, 16, 15)
- Cycle 8: (0, 9, 10, 14, 10)
- Cycle 9: (0, 9, 10, 16, 11)
- Cycle 10: (0, 9, 6, 5, 3, 11)
- Cycle 11: (0, 9, 6, 5, 1, 2)
- Cycle 12: (0, 9, 10, 16, 15, 7)
- Cycle 13: (0, 9, 10, 14, 10, 16)
- Cycle 14: (0, 9, 10, 16, 11, 3)
- Cycle 15: (0, 9, 6, 5, 3, 11, 16)
- Cycle 16: (0, 9, 6, 5, 1, 2, 7)
- Cycle 17: (0, 9, 10, 16, 15, 7, 2)
- Cycle 18: (0, 9, 10, 14, 10, 16, 15)
- Cycle 19: (0, 9, 10, 16, 11, 3, 19)
- Cycle 20: (0, 9, 6, 5, 3, 11, 16, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, 9, 10, 14, 10, 16, 15> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There were [19] chordless cycles found.
