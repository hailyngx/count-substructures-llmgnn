- <9, 21, (0, 11), 14> has exactly one chord.
- <10, 25, (11, 14), 0> has exactly one chord.
- <13, 16, (0, 11), 5> has exactly one chord.
- <18, 14, (4, 12), 11> has exactly one chord.
- <19, 18, (14, 1), 23> has exactly one chord.
- <25, 16, (3, 22), 9> has exactly one chord.
- <27, 21, (9, 22), 3> has exactly one chord.
- <29, 6, (7, 24), 12> has exactly one chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:

<7, 24, (15, 6), 12>
<9, 21, (0, 11), 14>
<10, 25, (11, 14), 0>
<13, 16, (0, 11), 5>
<18, 14, (4, 12), 11>
<19, 18, (14, 1), 23>
<25, 16, (3, 22), 9>
<27, 21, (9, 22), 3>
