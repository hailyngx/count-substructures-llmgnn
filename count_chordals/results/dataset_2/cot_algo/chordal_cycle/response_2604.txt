Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 0) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph. We need to check them for a chord.

1. Cycle <6, 7, 9, 6> with chord (6, 9)
2. Cycle <6, 8, 2, 6> with chord (6, 2)
3. Cycle <6, 4, 2, 6> with chord (6, 2)
4. Cycle <6, 8, 9, 6> with chord (8, 9)
5. Cycle <6, 4, 3, 6> 
6. Cycle <7, 9, 8, 7>
7. Cycle <2, 8, 9, 2> with chord (8, 9)
8. Cycle <2, 8, 3, 2> 
9. Cycle <8, 9, 7, 8>
10. Cycle <8, 2, 3, 8> 
11. Cycle <8, 3, 4, 8>
12. Cycle <8, 3, 5, 8>
13. Cycle <3, 0, 2, 3> with chord (0, 2)
14. Cycle <3, 0, 5, 3>
15. Cycle <0, 3, 5, 0>
16. Cycle <0, 1, 8, 0> 

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
- <6, 7, 9, 6> with chord (6, 9)
- <6, 8, 2, 6> with chord (6, 2)
- <2, 8, 9, 2> with chord (8, 9)
- <3, 0, 2, 3> with chord (0, 2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we have found 4 cycles with exactly one chord, so the final answer is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<6, 7, 9, 6> with chord (6, 9)
<6, 8, 2, 6> with chord (6, 2)
<2, 8, 9, 2> with chord (8, 9)
<3, 0, 2, 3> with chord (0, 2)
