Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 18) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 7) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (10, 0) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 9) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 9) (15, 5) (15, 13) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 9) (18, 5) (18, 14) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 0 -> 14 -> 2 -> 16 -> 11 -> 4 -> 0
- Cycle 2: 2 -> 16 -> 11 -> 4 -> 12 -> 13 -> 2
- Cycle 3: 3 -> 2 -> 16 -> 11 -> 4 -> 12 -> 3
- Cycle 4: 4 -> 11 -> 16 -> 2 -> 14 -> 0 -> 4
- Cycle 5: 5 -> 19 -> 6 -> 17 -> 8 -> 3 -> 2 -> 14 -> 0 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15 -> 5
- Cycle 6: 9 -> 11 -> 4 -> 12 -> 13 -> 10 -> 0 -> 14 -> 2 -> 3 -> 9
- Cycle 7: 13 -> 16 -> 11 -> 4 -> 12 -> 10 -> 13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the cycles listed above, only Cycle 1: 0 -> 14 -> 2 -> 16 -> 11 -> 4 -> 0 has exactly one chord.
The chord is the edge (0, 2) connecting non-adjacent nodes 0 and 2 in the cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There is 0 chordless cycle found.

So, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1], and the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, (0, 2), 14, 4>.
