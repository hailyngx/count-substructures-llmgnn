Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 9, 13, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 2, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 6, 3, 10, 12, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 4, 8, 11, 14, 9)
- Cycle 5: (6, 3, 11, 8, 4, 6)
- Cycle 6: (4, 0, 2, 7, 5, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 have exactly one chord (9, 4) and (4, 9) respectively.
- Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 5, and Cycle 6 do not have any chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (9, 4), 5>
- <2, (4, 9), 7>
