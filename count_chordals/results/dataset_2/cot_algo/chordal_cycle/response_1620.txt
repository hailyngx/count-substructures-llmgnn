Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 26) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 27) (4, 22) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 18) (12, 7) (12, 22) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 19) (14, 26) (14, 9) (14, 13) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 23) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 5) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 29) (10, 21) (10, 3) (26, 7) (26, 0) (26, 14) (26, 3) (25, 9) (25, 19) (27, 21) (27, 24) (22, 7) (22, 4) (22, 12) (22, 24) (11, 1) (11, 17) (24, 27) (24, 22) (24, 20) (6, 17) (6, 20) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 18) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 25) (9, 19) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 18) (19, 0) (19, 25) (19, 9) (19, 29) (29, 16) (29, 19) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 26) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 20) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 5) (20, 24) (20, 6) (20, 13) (23, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- <7, 12, 22, 4>
- <21, 10, 3, 26>
- <4, 0, 26, 14>
- <4, 1, 16, 28>
- <4, 15, 5, 8>
- <7, 26, 0, 4>
- <21, 28, 16, 1>
- <3, 12, 22, 7>
- <9, 25, 19, 0>
- <13, 14, 26, 7>
- <18, 17, 6, 20>
- <28, 21, 10, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <4, 0, 26, 14> - Chord: (4, 26)
- <4, 1, 16, 28> - Chord: (1, 28)
- <4, 15, 5, 8> - Chord: (5, 15)
- <7, 26, 0, 4> - Chord: (26, 4)
- <21, 28, 16, 1> - Chord: (21, 16)
- <3, 12, 22, 7> - Chord: (12, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, 0, 26, 14>
- <4, 1, 16, 28>
- <4, 15, 5, 8>
- <7, 26, 0, 4>
- <21, 28, 16, 1>
- <3, 12, 22, 7>
