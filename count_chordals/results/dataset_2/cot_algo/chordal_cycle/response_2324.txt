Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- (1, 3, 9, 4)
- (1, 8, 5, 6)
- (4, 9, 3, 1)
- (4, 8, 1, 3)
- (5, 8, 1, 3)
- (6, 5, 8, 1)
- (6, 8, 1, 3)
- (9, 4, 1, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, 3, 9, 4> has a chord (1, 9)
- <1, 8, 5, 6> has a chord (5, 8)
- <4, 9, 3, 1> has a chord (9, 1)
- <4, 8, 1, 3> has a chord (1, 8)
- <5, 8, 1, 3> has a chord (1, 8)
- <6, 5, 8, 1> has a chord (5, 8)
- <6, 8, 1, 3> has a chord (1, 8)
- <9, 4, 1, 3> has a chord (4, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
