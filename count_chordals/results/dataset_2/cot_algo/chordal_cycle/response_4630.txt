Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 1) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 5-9-4-2-5
2. Cycle 2: 5-9-14-0-5
3. Cycle 3: 5-6-8-2-5
4. Cycle 4: 5-3-7-8-5
5. Cycle 5: 3-7-13-9-3
6. Cycle 6: 3-7-1-12-3
7. Cycle 7: 7-13-12-1-7
8. Cycle 8: 9-4-11-6-9
9. Cycle 9: 4-2-8-6-4
10. Cycle 10: 2-13-7-3-2
11. Cycle 11: 0-14-10-8-0
12. Cycle 12: 14-10-12-1-14
13. Cycle 13: 6-5-3-7-6
14. Cycle 14: 8-2-4-9-8

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle 1 has a chord (4-2).
2. Cycle 2 has a chord (9-14).
3. Cycle 3 has a chord (6-8).
4. Cycle 4 does not have a chord.
5. Cycle 5 does not have a chord.
6. Cycle 6 has a chord (7-1).
7. Cycle 7 has a chord (12-1).
8. Cycle 8 has a chord (4-11).
9. Cycle 9 has a chord (2-8).
10. Cycle 10 has a chord (2-13).
11. Cycle 11 has a chord (10-14).
12. Cycle 12 has a chord (10-12).
13. Cycle 13 has a chord (5-3).
14. Cycle 14 has a chord (2-4).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 2 chordless cycles:
1. <5, 9, 14, 0>
2. <5, 3, 7, 6>

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [2].
