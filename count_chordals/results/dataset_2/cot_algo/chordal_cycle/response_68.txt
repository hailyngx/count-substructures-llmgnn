Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (0, 13) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-4-9-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-11-13-1
- Cycle 3: 1-9-4-6-1
- Cycle 4: 1-12-5-8-1
- Cycle 5: 3-4-6-7-3
- Cycle 6: 3-11-13-10-3
- Cycle 7: 3-9-4-7-3
- Cycle 8: 5-8-10-12-5
- Cycle 9: 5-12-2-7-5
- Cycle 10: 5-0-13-11-5
- Cycle 11: 5-14-11-7-5
- Cycle 12: 6-4-7-2-6
- Cycle 13: 6-7-2-12-6
- Cycle 14: 7-4-9-11-7
- Cycle 15: 7-11-13-0-7
- Cycle 16: 9-4-6-3-9
- Cycle 17: 9-7-2-12-9
- Cycle 18: 9-1-13-11-9
- Cycle 19: 10-8-5-12-10
- Cycle 20: 10-13-0-14-10
- Cycle 21: 10-2-12-14-10
- Cycle 22: 12-1-13-0-12
- Cycle 23: 12-5-8-1-12
- Cycle 24: 14-5-0-13-14
- Cycle 25: 14-11-7-2-14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, (4, 9), 1>
- <1, 3, (11, 13), 1>
- <1, 9, (4, 6), 1>
- <1, 12, (5, 8), 1>
- <3, 4, (6, 7), 3>
- <3, 11, (13, 10), 3>
- <3, 9, (4, 7), 3>
- <5, 8, (10, 12), 5>
- <5, 12, (2, 7), 5>
- <5, 0, (13, 11), 5>
- <5, 14, (7, 11), 5>
- <6, 4, (7, 2), 6>
- <6, 7, (2, 12), 6>
- <7, 4, (9, 11), 7>
- <7, 11, (13, 0), 7>
- <9, 4, (6, 3), 9>
- <9, 7, (2, 12), 9>
- <9, 1, (13, 11), 9>
- <10, 8, (5, 12), 10>
- <10, 13, (0, 14), 10>
- <10, 2, (12, 14), 10>
- <12, 1, (13, 0), 12>
- <12, 5, (8, 1), 12>
- <14, 5, (0, 13), 14>
- <14, 11, (7, 2), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [24]
