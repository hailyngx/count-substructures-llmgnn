Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle: 0-2-4-6-0
2. Cycle: 1-5-6-1
3. Cycle: 1-6-5-1
4. Cycle: 1-6-4-2-1
5. Cycle: 2-4-6-2
6. Cycle: 3-4-6-3
7. Cycle: 3-4-9-1-3
8. Cycle: 4-6-5-2-4
9. Cycle: 4-6-1-5-4
10. Cycle: 5-2-4-6-5
11. Cycle: 6-4-2-7-6
12. Cycle: 6-5-1-8-6
13. Cycle: 6-5-3-9-6
14. Cycle: 6-1-5-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1: 0-2-4-6-0 does not have any chords.
- Cycle 2: 1-5-6-1 has chord (5, 6) which connects non-adjacent nodes 1 and 6.
- Cycle 3: 1-6-5-1 has chord (5, 6) which connects non-adjacent nodes 1 and 5.
- Cycle 4: 1-6-4-2-1 has chord (4, 2) which connects non-adjacent nodes 1 and 2.
- Cycle 5: 2-4-6-2 does not have any chords.
- Cycle 6: 3-4-6-3 does not have any chords.
- Cycle 7: 3-4-9-1-3 has chord (4, 9) which connects non-adjacent nodes 3 and 9.
- Cycle 8: 4-6-5-2-4 has chord (6, 5) which connects non-adjacent nodes 4 and 5.
- Cycle 9: 4-6-1-5-4 has chord (6, 1) which connects non-adjacent nodes 4 and 1.
- Cycle 10: 5-2-4-6-5 has chord (2, 4) which connects non-adjacent nodes 2 and 4.
- Cycle 11: 6-4-2-7-6 has chord (4, 2) which connects non-adjacent nodes 6 and 2.
- Cycle 12: 6-5-1-8-6 has chord (5, 1) which connects non-adjacent nodes 6 and 1.
- Cycle 13: 6-5-3-9-6 has chord (5, 3) which connects non-adjacent nodes 6 and 3.
- Cycle 14: 6-1-5-6 has chord (1, 5) which connects non-adjacent nodes 6 and 5.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are [7] unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<1, (5, 6), 5), <1, (5, 6), 6), <1, (4, 2), 6), <3, (4, 9), 1), <4, (6, 5), 2), <4, (6, 1), 5), <4, (2, 4), 6)>
