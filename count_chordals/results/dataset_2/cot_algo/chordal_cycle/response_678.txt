Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 6, 4, 3, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 14, 10, 6, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 8, 7, 6, 10, 3, 13, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 0, 7, 6, 10, 13, 3, 12, 9, 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, 1, 0, 7, 6, 10, 14, 9, 12, 3, 13, 8, 5>
- Cycle 7: <5, 1, 2, 12, 9, 14, 10, 6, 4, 3, 13, 8, 7, 0, 5>
- Cycle 8: <5, 1, 11, 0, 7, 8, 13, 3, 12, 9, 14, 10, 6, 4, 1>
- Cycle 9: <5, 3, 13, 8, 7, 0, 11, 1, 4, 6, 10, 14, 9, 12, 5>
- Cycle 10: <5, 3, 13, 8, 7, 0, 12, 9, 14, 10, 6, 4, 1, 11, 3>
- Cycle 11: <5, 0, 12, 9, 14, 10, 6, 4, 1, 11, 3, 13, 8, 7, 0>
- Cycle 12: <5, 1, 0, 11, 6, 4, 3, 13, 8, 7, 10, 14, 9, 12, 1>
- Cycle 13: <5, 9, 12, 2, 1, 11, 7, 0, 3, 13, 10, 14, 6, 4, 5>
- Cycle 14: <5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 13, 10, 14, 9, 12, 0, 1, 11, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1: Chord found: (6, 8)
- Cycle 2: Chord found: (9, 3) 
- Cycle 3: Chord found: (9, 10)
- Cycle 4: Chord found: (7, 13)
- Cycle 5: Chord found: (6, 10)
- Cycle 6: Chord found: (5, 9)
- Cycle 7: Chord found: (5, 7)
- Cycle 8: Chord found: (0, 9)
- Cycle 9: Chord found: (5, 12)
- Cycle 10: Chord found: (6, 9)
- Cycle 11: Chord found: (5, 10)
- Cycle 12: Chord found: (7, 12)
- Cycle 13: Chord found: (9, 11)
- Cycle 14: Chord found: (6, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. Thus, the final count is [14].
