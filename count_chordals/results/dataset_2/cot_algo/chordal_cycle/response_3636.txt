Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 5 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 5
        - Cycle 2: 6 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 6
        - Cycle 3: 6 - 2 - 7 - 4 - 6
        - Cycle 4: 4 - 9 - 1 - 7 - 4
        - Cycle 5: 8 - 9 - 1 - 4 - 8
        - Cycle 6: 3 - 4 - 1 - 8 - 3
        - Cycle 7: 0 - 5 - 2 - 7 - 0
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: 5 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 5 <(5, 9)>
        - Cycle 2: 6 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 6 <(6, 4)>
        - Cycle 3: 6 - 2 - 7 - 4 - 6 <(2, 7)>
        - Cycle 4: 4 - 9 - 1 - 7 - 4 <(9, 1)>
        - Cycle 5: 8 - 9 - 1 - 4 - 8 <(9, 1)>
        - Cycle 6: 3 - 4 - 1 - 8 - 3 <(4, 1)>
        - Cycle 7: 0 - 5 - 2 - 7 - 0 <(5, 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 0 chordless cycles found. 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        <5, 6, 9, 8, 5> with chord (5, 9)
        <6, 9, 4, 7, 6> with chord (6, 4)
        <6, 2, 7, 4, 6> with chord (2, 7)
        <4, 9, 1, 7, 4> with chord (9, 1)
        <8, 9, 1, 4, 8> with chord (9, 1)
        <3, 4, 1, 8, 3> with chord (4, 1)
        <0, 5, 2, 7, 0> with chord (5, 2)
