Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 10) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 1) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 6, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 6, 2, 4)
- Cycle 3: (7, 12, 8, 7)
- Cycle 4: (7, 13, 12, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 1, 14, 7)
- Cycle 6: (5, 13, 7, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 3, 8, 5)
- Cycle 8: (6, 2, 8, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 11, 13, 6)
- Cycle 10: (2, 8, 12, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 9, 7, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 10, 12, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 14, 1, 2)
- Cycle 14: (8, 12, 14, 8)
- Cycle 15: (0, 11, 6, 0)
- Cycle 16: (2, 6, 4, 2)
- Cycle 17: (3, 5, 13, 3)
- Cycle 18: (3, 8, 2, 3)
- Cycle 19: (3, 10, 12, 3)
- Cycle 20: (1, 14, 12, 1)
- Cycle 21: (1, 11, 13, 1)
- Cycle 22: (1, 10, 2, 1)
- Cycle 23: (11, 0, 9, 11)
- Cycle 24: (11, 13, 7, 11)
- Cycle 25: (11, 1, 14, 11)
- Cycle 26: (9, 0, 11, 9)
- Cycle 27: (9, 2, 6, 9)
- Cycle 28: (9, 14, 12, 9)
- Cycle 29: (10, 2, 6, 10)
- Cycle 30: (10, 12, 14, 10)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (5, 13), 6> (Cycle 6 has one chord: 5-13)
- <2, (4, 6), 6> (Cycle 16 has one chord: 4-6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [28]
