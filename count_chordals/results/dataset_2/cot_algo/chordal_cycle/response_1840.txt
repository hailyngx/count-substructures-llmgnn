Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:  
- (11, 10, 11, 18)  
- (11, 18, 1, 2)  
- (11, 2, 4, 18)  
- (11, 5, 0, 16)  
- (16, 15, 9, 17)  
- (16, 0, 13, 7)  
- (16, 8, 5, 0)  
- (16, 19, 2, 1)  
- (3, 12, 17, 6)  
- (3, 4, 2, 1)  
- (4, 3, 12, 17)  
- (4, 18, 7, 17)  
- (18, 11, 10, 11)  
- (18, 4, 2, 1)  
- (18, 7, 17, 12)  
- (18, 1, 2, 4)  
- (1, 18, 7, 17)  
- (1, 2, 4, 18)  
- (17, 6, 12, 3)  
- (17, 9, 15, 12)  
- (17, 7, 13, 8)  
- (17, 12, 3, 4)  
- (0, 16, 15, 9)  
- (0, 13, 7, 17)  
- (0, 5, 8, 13)  
- (0, 16, 19, 2)  
- (6, 17, 12, 3)  
- (6, 12, 3, 4)  
- (5, 11, 2, 1)  
- (5, 8, 13, 7)  
- (5, 0, 16, 19)  
- (5, 14, 19, 16)  
- (2, 11, 10, 11)  
- (2, 4, 18, 7)  
- (2, 1, 18, 11)  
- (2, 19, 16, 15)  
- (9, 15, 16, 0)  
- (9, 17, 7, 18)  
- (19, 16, 0, 5)  
- (19, 2, 4, 3)  
- (19, 14, 5, 11)  
- (12, 3, 4, 18)  
- (12, 15, 16, 0)  
- (12, 17, 7, 13)  
- (12, 6, 17, 9)  
- (14, 5, 11, 10)  
- (14, 19, 16, 0)  
- (7, 13, 8, 5)  
- (7, 18, 4, 3)  
- (7, 17, 12, 6)  

Step 2: 
- The cycle (11, 10, 11, 18) has exactly one chord (11, 18)  
- The cycle (16, 15, 9, 17) has exactly one chord (15, 9)  
- The cycle (16, 0, 13, 7) has exactly one chord (0, 13)  
- The cycle (16, 8, 5, 0) has exactly one chord (8, 5)  
- The cycle (16, 19, 2, 1) has exactly one chord (19, 2)  
- The cycle (3, 12, 17, 6) has exactly one chord (12, 17)  
- The cycle (4, 3, 12, 17) has exactly one chord (3, 12)  
- The cycle (1, 18, 7, 17) has exactly one chord (18, 7)  
- The cycle (17, 6, 12, 3) has exactly one chord (6, 12)  
- The cycle (0, 16, 15, 9) has exactly one chord (16, 15)  

Step 3:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final number is [10]. 
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <11, 10, 11, 18>
- <16, 15, 9, 17>
- <16, 0, 13, 7>
- <16, 8, 5, 0>
- <16, 19, 2, 1>
- <3, 12, 17, 6>
- <4, 3, 12, 17>
- <1, 18, 7, 17>
- <17, 6, 12, 3>
- <0, 16, 15, 9>
