Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 10, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 12, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 4, 12, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 14, 0, 11, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 14, 13, 7, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 4, 7, 6, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 10, 2, 7, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 10, 2, 8, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 12, 3, 10, 9)
- Cycle 11: (4, 9, 10, 11, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 9, 12, 3, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 7, 2, 10, 4)
- Cycle 14: (7, 6, 0, 11, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 2, 10, 3, 7)
- Cycle 16: (6, 5, 11, 0, 6)
- Cycle 17: (6, 7, 2, 10, 6)
- Cycle 18: (10, 9, 4, 12, 10)
- Cycle 19: (10, 11, 13, 3, 10)
- Cycle 20: (11, 5, 9, 4, 11)
- Cycle 21: (11, 13, 14, 5, 11)
- Cycle 22: (1, 12, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 23: (3, 10, 2, 7, 3)
- Cycle 24: (3, 12, 4, 9, 3)
- Cycle 25: (2, 7, 4, 9, 2)
- Cycle 26: (2, 10, 3, 12, 2)
- Cycle 27: (8, 9, 4, 12, 8)
- Cycle 28: (8, 2, 7, 4, 8)
- Cycle 29: (8, 10, 3, 12, 8)
- Cycle 30: (0, 6, 7, 4, 0)
- Cycle 31: (0, 14, 13, 11, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <5, 9, 6, 5>: Chord = (5, 6)
- <5, 9, 10, 5>: Chord = (5, 10)
- <5, 9, 12, 5>: Chord = (5, 12)
- <5, 14, 13, 7, 5>: Chord = (5, 7)
- <9, 4, 7, 6, 9>: Chord = (9, 6)
- <9, 10, 2, 8, 9>: Chord = (9, 8)
- <4, 9, 10, 11, 4>: Chord = (4, 11)
- <7, 6, 0, 11, 7>: Chord = (7, 11)
- <6, 7, 2, 10, 6>: Chord = (6, 10)
- <10, 11, 13, 3, 10>: Chord = (10, 13)
- <11, 5, 9, 4, 11>: Chord = (11, 4)
- <3, 10, 2, 7, 3>: Chord = (3, 7)
- <2, 7, 4, 9, 2>: Chord = (2, 9)
- <8, 9, 4, 12, 8>: Chord = (8, 12)
- <14, 13, 11, 0, 14>: Chord = (14, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [15].
