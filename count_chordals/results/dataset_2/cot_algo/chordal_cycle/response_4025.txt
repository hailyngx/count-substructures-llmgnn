Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. (5, 9, 1, 4)
2. (5, 3, 4, 8)
3. (5, 7, 0, 9)
4. (5, 8, 4, 2)
5. (9, 4, 3, 1)
6. (9, 1, 7, 5)
7. (1, 4, 3, 6)
8. (3, 4, 8, 7)
9. (4, 8, 7, 2)
10. (4, 9, 0, 6)
11. (8, 4, 2, 6)
12. (6, 3, 7, 0)
13. (6, 7, 5, 9)
14. (6, 2, 4, 8)
15. (0, 5, 7, 3)
16. (0, 9, 1, 7)
17. (0, 6, 3, 4)
18. (7, 5, 9, 0)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- (5, 9, 1, 4) has chord (1,4), cycle <1, (1, 4), 4>
- (5, 3, 4, 8) has chord (3,8), cycle <2, (3, 8), 8>
- (5, 7, 0, 9) has chord (0,7), cycle <3, (0, 7), 9>
- (5, 8, 4, 2) has chord (4,2), cycle <4, (4, 2), 8>
- (9, 4, 3, 1) has chord (4,3), cycle <5, (4, 3), 1>
- (9, 1, 7, 5) has chord (1,7), cycle <6, (1, 7), 5>
- (1, 4, 3, 6) has chord (4,3), cycle <7, (4, 3), 6>
- (3, 4, 8, 7) has chord (4,8), cycle <8, (4, 8), 7>
- (4, 8, 7, 2) has chord (8,7), cycle <9, (8, 7), 2>
- (4, 9, 0, 6) has chord (9,0), cycle <10, (9, 0), 6>
- (8, 4, 2, 6) has chord (4,6), cycle <11, (4, 6), 8>
- (6, 3, 7, 0) has chord (3,7), cycle <12, (3, 7), 6>
- (6, 7, 5, 9) has chord (7,5), cycle <13, (7, 5), 6>
- (6, 2, 4, 8) has chord (2,4), cycle <14, (2, 4), 6>
- (0, 5, 7, 3) has chord (5,7), cycle <15, (5, 7), 0>
- (0, 9, 1, 7) has chord (9,1), cycle <16, (9, 1), 0>
- (0, 6, 3, 4) has chord (3,6), cycle <17, (3, 6), 0>
- (7, 5, 9, 0) has chord (5,9), cycle <18, (5, 9), 7>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles = 18
So, the answer is [18].
