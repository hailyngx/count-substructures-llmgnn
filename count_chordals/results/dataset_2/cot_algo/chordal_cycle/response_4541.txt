Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        
        - Cycle 1: (4, 10, 5, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 10, 12, 4)
        - Cycle 3: (4, 10, 14, 4)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 14, 12, 4)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 14, 10, 4)
        - Cycle 6: (7, 12, 10, 7)
        - Cycle 7: (7, 12, 4, 7)
        - Cycle 8: (7, 12, 14, 7)
        - Cycle 9: (7, 12, 10, 4, 5, 0, 7)
        - Cycle 10: (7, 12, 14, 10, 4, 5, 0, 7)
        - Cycle 11: (10, 4, 5, 0, 10)
        - Cycle 12: (10, 4, 14, 12, 7, 0, 5, 10)
        - Cycle 13: (10, 4, 14, 6, 11, 3, 2, 10)
        - Cycle 14: (11, 10, 12, 7, 0, 5, 6, 11)
        - Cycle 15: (11, 10, 4, 5, 0, 7, 12, 11)
        - Cycle 16: (12, 4, 14, 10, 7, 0, 5, 12)
        - Cycle 17: (12, 7, 0, 5, 10, 14, 4, 12)
        - Cycle 18: (12, 14, 4, 10, 7, 0, 5, 12)
        - Cycle 19: (14, 4, 10, 7, 0, 5, 12, 14)
        - Cycle 20: (14, 4, 10, 12, 7, 0, 5, 14)
        - Cycle 21: (14, 10, 4, 5, 0, 7, 12, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <4, (5, 10), 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (10, 12), 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (10, 14), 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (12, 14), 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, (10, 14), 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <7, (10, 12), 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (12, 14), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        
        There are 0 chordless cycles.
        
Putting it all together, the final answer is [0].
