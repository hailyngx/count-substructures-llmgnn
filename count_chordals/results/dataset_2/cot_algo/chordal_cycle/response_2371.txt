Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 11) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

(1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 1)
(1, 5, 3, 6, 10, 9, 4, 2, 1)
(1, 5, 6, 11, 12, 4, 9, 8, 5, 1)
(1, 7, 3, 6, 10, 9, 4, 2, 1)
(1, 7, 3, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 10, 9, 4, 2, 1)
(0, 2, 6, 3, 5, 1, 7, 13, 10, 9, 4, 12, 11, 8, 0)
(0, 8, 9, 14, 5, 1, 3, 10, 13, 12, 4, 2, 6, 11, 8, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<1, (5, 3), 6>
<1, (3, 6), 10>
<1, (5, 6), 11>
<1, (3, 6), 7>
<1, (3, 10), 9>
<0, (6, 10), 2>
<0, (9, 5), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final result is [7].
