Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-3-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-7-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-5-4-0
- Cycle 4: 0-2-8-7-0
- Cycle 5: 1-3-5-6-1
- Cycle 6: 1-3-8-7-1
- Cycle 7: 4-5-3-1-4
- Cycle 8: 4-5-2-0-4
- Cycle 9: 5-6-3-1-5
- Cycle 10: 5-2-0-4-5

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-3-5-0 with chord 3-1
- Cycle 2: 0-1-7-4-0 with chord 7-4
- Cycle 3: 0-2-5-4-0 with chord 5-2
- Cycle 4: 0-2-8-7-0 with chord 8-7
- Cycle 5: 1-3-5-6-1 with chord 6-5
- Cycle 6: 1-3-8-7-1 with chord 8-3
- Cycle 7: 4-5-3-1-4 with chord 3-4
- Cycle 8: 5-6-3-1-5 with chord 6-3

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 1, 3, 5> with chord (3, 1)
- <4, 5, 3, 1> with chord (3, 4)
