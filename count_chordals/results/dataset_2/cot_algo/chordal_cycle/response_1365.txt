Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 9) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 5) (3, 17) (11, 19) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 14) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 2) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 12) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 16) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 2) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 16) (18, 6) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 2) (16, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 9, 0, 4)
- Cycle 2: (1, 17, 13, 15, 1)
- Cycle 3: (17, 3, 17)
- Cycle 4: (19, 11, 19)
- Cycle 5: (10, 19, 2, 0, 10)
- Cycle 6: (15, 10, 19, 8, 15)
- Cycle 7: (13, 17, 1, 5, 13)
- Cycle 8: (8, 19, 2, 0, 8)
- Cycle 9: (12, 4, 7, 9, 12)
- Cycle 10: (14, 13, 17, 5, 14)
- Cycle 11: (0, 12, 14, 8, 0)
- Cycle 12: (6, 1, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 13: (2, 19, 11, 17, 2)
- Cycle 14: (5, 1, 6, 8, 5)
- Cycle 15: (9, 7, 4, 12, 9)
- Cycle 16: (18, 6, 1, 17, 18)
- Cycle 17: (16, 4, 7, 9, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- The cycle <4, 7, 9, 0, 4> has a chord (9, 0)
- The cycle <1, 17, 13, 15, 1> has a chord (13, 15)
- The cycle <17, 3, 17> has no chord
- The cycle <19, 11, 19> has no chord
- The cycle <10, 19, 2, 0, 10> has a chord (19, 2)
- The cycle <15, 10, 19, 8, 15> has a chord (19, 8)
- The cycle <13, 17, 1, 5, 13> has no chord
- The cycle <8, 19, 2, 0, 8> has a chord (19, 2)
- The cycle <12, 4, 7, 9, 12> has no chord
- The cycle <14, 13, 17, 5, 14> has no chord
- The cycle <0, 12, 14, 8, 0> has no chord
- The cycle <6, 1, 5, 2, 6> has no chord
- The cycle <2, 19, 11, 17, 2> has a chord (19, 11)
- The cycle <5, 1, 6, 8, 5> has no chord
- The cycle <9, 7, 4, 12, 9> has a chord (7, 12)
- The cycle <18, 6, 1, 17, 18> has no chord
- The cycle <16, 4, 7, 9, 16> has a chord (4, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final count is [8].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <17, 3, 17> 
2. <19, 11, 19> 
3. <13, 17, 1, 5, 13> 
4. <14, 13, 17, 5, 14>
5. <0, 12, 14, 8, 0> 
6. <6, 1, 5, 2, 6> 
7. <5, 1, 6, 8, 5>
8. <18, 6, 1, 17, 18>
