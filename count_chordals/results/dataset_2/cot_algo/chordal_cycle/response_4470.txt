Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 2, 13) with edges (6, 9), (9, 2), (2, 13), (13, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 14, 0, 11) with edges (6, 14), (14, 0), (0, 11), (11, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 5, 8, 3) with edges (6, 5), (5, 8), (8, 3), (3, 6)
- Cycle 4: (9, 13, 1, 7) with edges (9, 13), (13, 1), (1, 7), (7, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 0, 14, 6) with edges (9, 0), (0, 14), (14, 6), (6, 9)
- Cycle 6: (10, 13, 2, 7) with edges (10, 13), (13, 2), (2, 7), (7, 10)
- Cycle 7: (10, 5, 8, 14) with edges (10, 5), (5, 8), (8, 14), (14, 10)
- Cycle 8: (8, 3, 5, 14) with edges (8, 3), (3, 5), (5, 14), (14, 8)
- Cycle 9: (12, 7, 1, 13) with edges (12, 7), (7, 1), (1, 13), (13, 12)
- Cycle 10: (0, 11, 2, 9) with edges (0, 11), (11, 2), (2, 9), (9, 0)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Only Cycle 1 has a chord (6, 13).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:  
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].  
The unique chordal 4-cycle is <6, 9, 2, 13>, with chord (6, 13).
