Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 19) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 19) (1, 12) (1, 17) (1, 19) (17, 1) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 7) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 14) (16, 0) (16, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 15) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 13) (8, 0) (8, 18) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 11) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 13) (4, 5) (4, 3) (13, 0) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- <0, 7, 10, 0> 
- <0, 7, 10, 7> 
- <0, 16, 14, 15, 19, 6, 9, 2, 12, 1, 17, 1, 12, 19, 15, 5, 18, 8, 0> 
- <0, 16, 14, 13, 0>
- <2, 12, 1, 17, 1, 12, 19, 6, 9, 2> 
- <2, 12, 1, 19, 6, 9, 2> 
- <2, 12, 19, 6, 9, 2> 
- <3, 2, 12, 1, 17, 1, 12, 19, 6, 9, 2, 11, 18, 5, 4, 3> 
- <3, 2, 12, 1, 19, 6, 9, 2, 11, 18, 5, 4, 3> 
- <3, 2, 12, 19, 6, 9, 2, 11, 18, 5, 4, 3> 
- <4, 5, 18, 11, 13, 14, 16, 0, 7, 10, 15, 19, 6, 2, 3> 
- <4, 5, 18, 11, 13, 14, 16, 0, 7, 10, 15, 19, 6, 9, 2, 3> 
- <4, 5, 15, 19, 6, 2, 3, 14, 13, 11, 18, 8, 0> 
- <5, 18, 11, 13, 14, 16, 0, 7, 10, 15> 
- <5, 18, 11, 13, 14, 16, 0, 7, 10, 15, 19, 6, 9, 2, 3, 4> 
- <6, 9, 2, 11, 18, 5, 4, 3, 14, 13, 11, 19, 15> 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <0, 7, 10, 0> has 1 chord: (7, 16)
- <2, 12, 1, 17, 1, 12, 19, 6, 9, 2, 11, 18, 5, 4, 3> has 1 chord: (9, 13)
- <4, 5, 18, 11, 13, 14, 16, 0, 7, 10, 15> has 1 chord: (14, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
