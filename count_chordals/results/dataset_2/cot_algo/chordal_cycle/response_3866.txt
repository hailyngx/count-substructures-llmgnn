Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 4-7-6-1-4
- Cycle 2: 4-7-9-8-4
- Cycle 3: 4-5-8-2-4
- Cycle 4: 4-5-1-9-4
- Cycle 5: 7-6-1-5-7
- Cycle 6: 7-6-3-9-7
- Cycle 7: 1-6-7-4-1
- Cycle 8: 1-6-3-9-1
- Cycle 9: 3-6-7-5-3
- Cycle 10: 3-6-1-9-3
- Cycle 11: 8-5-7-9-8
- Cycle 12: 8-5-1-9-8
- Cycle 13: 8-5-4-9-8
- Cycle 14: 5-7-9-1-5
- Cycle 15: 5-7-4-9-5
- Cycle 16: 5-1-9-4-5
- Cycle 17: 5-1-6-7-5
- Cycle 18: 6-7-5-1-6
- Cycle 19: 6-7-4-9-6
- Cycle 20: 6-1-9-3-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <4, (7, 9), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (5, 8), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (6, 7), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (6, 3), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, (6, 7), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <8, (5, 7), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 20 cycles in total from Step 1. Considering the chordal 4-cycles found in Step 2, there are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
