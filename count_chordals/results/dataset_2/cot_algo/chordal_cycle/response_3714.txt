3. (11, 16, 9, 4)
4. (11, 15, 17, 0)
5. (11, 15, 3, 5)
6. (11, 10, 4, 19)
7. (16, 12, 17, 0)
8. (16, 12, 17, 2)
9. (16, 17, 0, 19)
10. (16, 17, 0, 1)
11. (16, 17, 2, 18)
12. (16, 17, 15, 3)
13. (16, 8, 19, 0)
14. (16, 8, 19, 2)
15. (16, 8, 10, 5)
16. (16, 9, 4, 10)
17. (3, 15, 17, 0)
18. (3, 15, 17, 2)
19. (15, 17, 0, 19)
20. (15, 17, 0, 1)
21. (15, 17, 2, 18)
22. (10, 4, 9, 16)
23. (10, 4, 2, 18)
24. (10, 4, 2, 1)
25. (10, 4, 2, 19)
26. (10, 4, 6, 8)
27. (10, 19, 0, 17)
28. (10, 19, 0, 1)
29. (8, 19, 0, 17)
30. (8, 19, 0, 1)
31. (13, 7, 1, 2)
32. (13, 18, 2, 17)
33. (2, 18, 13, 7)
34. (2, 18, 13, 10)
35. (2, 18, 10, 4)
36. (2, 18, 10, 19)
37. (2, 18, 10, 5)
38. (2, 1, 0, 17)
39. (2, 1, 0, 19)
40. (18, 10, 4, 6)
41. (18, 10, 4, 9)
42. (0, 17, 16, 12)
43. (0, 17, 16, 11)
44. (16, 12, 17, 15)
45. (16, 17, 15, 3)
46. (16, 17, 2, 1)
47. (16, 17, 2, 18)
48. (16, 17, 0, 19)
49. (16, 17, 0, 1)
50. (16, 17, 0, 4)
51. (16, 8, 10, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycle found is:
<16, 17, 0, 19, (8, 10)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 50 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
