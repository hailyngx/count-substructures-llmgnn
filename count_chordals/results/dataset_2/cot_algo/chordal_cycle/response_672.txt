- Cycle 31: 0-8-4-5-3-7-9-0
- Cycle 32: 0-8-9-7-4-5-3-0

Step 2:
We will check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (1, 4) and (4, 5)
- Cycle 2 has 2 chords: (1, 2) and (2, 7)
- Cycle 3 has 2 chords: (1, 8) and (8, 9)
- Cycle 4 has 2 chords: (1, 2) and (2, 7)
- Cycle 5 has 2 chords: (2, 6) and (6, 3)
- Cycle 6 has 2 chords: (2, 6) and (6, 3)
- Cycle 7 has 2 chords: (2, 6) and (6, 3)
- Cycle 8 has 2 chords: (2, 7) and (7, 4)
- Cycle 9 has 2 chords: (2, 7) and (7, 9)
- Cycle 10 has 2 chords: (3, 5) and (5, 4)
- Cycle 11 has 2 chords: (3, 5) and (5, 4)
- Cycle 12 is a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 3, 5, 4>
- Cycle 13 has 2 chords: (3, 6) and (6, 2)
- Cycle 14 has 2 chords: (3, 7) and (7, 2)
- Cycle 15 has 2 chords: (3, 7) and (7, 9)
- Cycle 16 has 2 chords: (3, 5) and (5, 4)
- Cycle 17 has 2 chords: (3, 5) and (5, 4)
- Cycle 18 has 2 chords: (4, 5) and (5, 3)
- Cycle 19 has 2 chords: (6, 4) and (4, 8)
- Cycle 20 has 2 chords: (6, 4) and (4, 8)
- Cycle 21 has 2 chords: (6, 4) and (4, 8)
- Cycle 22 has 2 chords: (6, 4) and (4, 8)
- Cycle 23 has 2 chords: (6, 4) and (4, 8)
- Cycle 24 has 2 chords: (6, 4) and (4, 8)
- Cycle 25 has 2 chords: (6, 4) and (4, 8)
- Cycle 26 has 2 chords: (6, 4) and (4, 8)
- Cycle 27 has 2 chords: (6, 4) and (4, 8)
- Cycle 28 has 2 chords: (7, 6) and (6, 2)
- Cycle 29 has 2 chords: (7, 6) and (6, 2)
- Cycle 30 has 2 chords: (7, 4) and (4, 5)
- Cycle 31 has 2 chords: (7, 4) and (4, 5)
- Cycle 32 has 2 chords: (7, 9) and (9, 8)

Step 3:
After checking for chords in each cycle, we found the following unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 3, 5, 4>
- <7, 9, 8, 2>
- <6, 4, 8, 2>
- <7, 4, 5, 3>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
