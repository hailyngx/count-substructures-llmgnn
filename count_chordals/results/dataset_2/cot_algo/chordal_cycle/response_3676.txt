Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 12) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 12) (0, 10) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 4) (1, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 4-1-10-0-4
- Cycle 2: 4-1-10-2-14-4
- Cycle 3: 4-1-10-6-5-4
- Cycle 4: 7-4-1-10-6-5-7
- Cycle 5: 7-4-1-10-0-9-7
- Cycle 6: 7-4-6-10-0-9-7
- Cycle 7: 7-4-6-5-12-11-7
- Cycle 8: 7-4-6-10-2-14-7
- Cycle 9: 7-4-11-12-5-7
- Cycle 10: 8-6-10-0-9-8
- Cycle 11: 8-6-10-2-14-8
- Cycle 12: 8-6-5-12-11-8
- Cycle 13: 8-5-12-11-4-8
- Cycle 14: 8-5-6-10-0-8
- Cycle 15: 8-5-6-4-7-8
- Cycle 16: 8-5-6-4-11-8
- Cycle 17: 8-3-7-4-6-8
- Cycle 18: 8-3-7-4-11-8
- Cycle 19: 8-3-11-12-5-8
- Cycle 20: 8-3-11-4-7-8
- Cycle 21: 8-3-2-9-0-8
- Cycle 22: 8-3-2-10-6-8
- Cycle 23: 8-3-2-14-4-8
- Cycle 24: 13-8-5-12-14-13
- Cycle 25: 13-8-5-6-10-13
- Cycle 26: 13-8-6-4-11-13
- Cycle 27: 13-8-6-4-7-13
- Cycle 28: 13-12-11-4-6-13
- Cycle 29: 13-12-11-5-6-13
- Cycle 30: 13-12-5-6-4-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycles:
    <1, (14, 2), 4>
    <1, (6, 10), 5>
    <7, (10, 0), 9>
    <7, (6, 10), 4>
    <4, (1, 10), 6>
    <8, (5, 12), 6>
    <8, (5, 6), 11>
    <8, (3, 7), 6>
    <8, (11, 4), 6>
    <13, (5, 12), 8>
    <13, (6, 4), 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
As there are 11 chordal 4-cycles found, the number of chordless cycles is [30].
