Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 7, 5, 0, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 6, 7, 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, 6, 4, 9, 3>
- Cycle 5: <4, 6, 7, 8, 4>
- Cycle 6: <5, 7, 0, 8, 5>
- Cycle 7: <6, 3, 4, 9, 6>
- Cycle 8: <7, 5, 9, 2, 7>
- Cycle 9: <8, 0, 5, 9, 8>
- Cycle 10: <9, 2, 6, 4, 9>

Step 2: Checking for a single chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 8, 7, 5, 0> - Chord: (7, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 7, 5, 0, 1> - Chord: (0, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, 4, 6, 7, 2> - Chord: (4, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 6, 4, 9, 3> - Chord: (4, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, 6, 7, 8, 4> - Chord: (7, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, 7, 0, 8, 5> - Chord: (0, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, 3, 4, 9, 6> - Chord: (4, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <7, 5, 9, 2, 7> - Chord: (5, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <8, 0, 5, 9, 8> - Chord: (5, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <9, 2, 6, 4, 9> - Chord: (2, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [10].
