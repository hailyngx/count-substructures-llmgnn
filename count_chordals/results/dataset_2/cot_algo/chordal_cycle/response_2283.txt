- Cycle 2: (6, 5, 2, 4)
- Cycle 3: (6, 1, 9, 4)
- Cycle 4: (6, 1, 7, 4)
- Cycle 5: (6, 1, 5, 0)
- Cycle 6: (6, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 7: (6, 8, 5, 0)
- Cycle 8: (6, 2, 4, 9)
- Cycle 9: (6, 2, 7, 3)
- Cycle 10: (6, 2, 5, 0)
- Cycle 11: (9, 4, 3, 7)
- Cycle 12: (9, 0, 5, 6)
- Cycle 13: (4, 7, 3, 5)
- Cycle 14: (7, 8, 5, 0)
- Cycle 15: (8, 6, 5, 0)
- Cycle 16: (8, 7, 3, 5)
- Cycle 17: (5, 6, 8, 7)
- Cycle 18: (5, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 19: (5, 8, 6, 1)
- Cycle 20: (5, 8, 7, 1)
- Cycle 21: (0, 5, 8, 7)
- Cycle 22: (1, 6, 8, 5)
- Cycle 23: (1, 9, 4, 7)
- Cycle 24: (1, 7, 3, 4)
- Cycle 25: (3, 7, 4, 9)
- Cycle 26: (2, 6, 5, 0)
- Cycle 27: (2, 4, 7, 3)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <6, (5, 0), 9>
- Cycle 2: <6, (5, 2), 4>
- Cycle 3: <6, (1, 9), 4>
- Cycle 4: <6, (1, 7), 4>
- Cycle 5: <6, (1, 5), 0>
- Cycle 6: <6, (8, 7), 4>
- Cycle 7: <6, (8, 5), 0>
- Cycle 8: <6, (2, 4), 9>
- Cycle 9: <6, (2, 7), 3>
- Cycle 10: <6, (2, 5), 0>
- Cycle 11: <9, (4, 3), 7>
- Cycle 12: <9, (0, 5), 6>
- Cycle 13: <4, (7, 3), 5>
- Cycle 14: <7, (8, 5), 0>
- Cycle 15: <8, (6, 5), 0>
- Cycle 16: <8, (7, 3), 5>
- Cycle 17: <5, (6, 8), 7>
- Cycle 18: <5, (8, 7), 4>
- Cycle 19: <5, (8, 6), 1>
- Cycle 20: <5, (8, 7), 1>
- Cycle 21: <0, (5, 8), 7>
- Cycle 22: <1, (6, 8), 5>
- Cycle 23: <1, (9, 4), 7>
- Cycle 24: <1, (7, 3), 4>
- Cycle 25: <3, (7, 4), 9>
- Cycle 26: <2, (6, 5), 0>
- Cycle 27: <2, (4, 7), 3>

Step 3:
Finally, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [27].
