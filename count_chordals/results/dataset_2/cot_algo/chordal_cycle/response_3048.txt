Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the given graph are:
1. <5, 9, 0, 1, 5>
2. <9, 12, 3, 6, 9>
3. <4, 7, 2, 0, 4>
4. <7, 8, 2, 4, 7>
5. <2, 8, 14, 13, 2>
6. <8, 5, 1, 0, 8>
7. <0, 10, 2, 7, 0>
8. <14, 3, 6, 12, 14>
9. <3, 11, 14, 13, 3>
10. <11, 4, 2, 7, 11>
11. <1, 12, 6, 3, 1>
12. <6, 2, 0, 10, 6>
13. <10, 9, 12, 6, 10>
14. <13, 7, 4, 11, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is:
- <4, 5, 1, 2, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
