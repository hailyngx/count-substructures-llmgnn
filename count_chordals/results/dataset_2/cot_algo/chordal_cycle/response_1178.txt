Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 21) (27, 15) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 8) (17, 22) (17, 8) (17, 2) (20, 1) (20, 12) (20, 2) (20, 16) (25, 6) (25, 21) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 29) (11, 10) (11, 24) (12, 20) (12, 18) (12, 19) (28, 22) (28, 18) (28, 23) (29, 10) (29, 24) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 2) (18, 12) (18, 28) (18, 6) (18, 13) (13, 18) (13, 7) (26, 14) (26, 8) (5, 1) (5, 24) (5, 21) (2, 17) (2, 20) (2, 4) (2, 23) (22, 17) (22, 28) (22, 4) (22, 6) (0, 10) (0, 9) (24, 11) (24, 29) (24, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 9) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 22) (16, 20) (16, 4) (16, 8) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 8) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 26) (8, 16) (8, 1) (23, 28) (23, 2) (23, 7) (23, 21) (21, 15) (21, 25) (21, 5) (21, 23) (19, 12) (19, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (14, 26, 8, 17, 22, 4, 2, 20, 12) 
- Cycle 2: (20, 16, 4, 22, 17, 8, 26, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1: (14, 26) is the only chord in <14, 26, 8, 17, 22, 4, 2, 20, 12>
- Cycle 2: (17, 8) is the only chord in <20, 16, 4, 22, 17, 8, 26, 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
