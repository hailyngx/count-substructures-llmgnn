Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 5 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 1 - 4 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 3: 1 - 3 - 4 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 5: 0 - 7 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 6: 3 - 4 - 9 - 3
- Cycle 7: 8 - 9 - 2 - 8
- Cycle 8: 5 - 8 - 9 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 5, 6>: Chord = (1, 5)
- <0, 1, 4, 6>: Chord = (1, 4)
- <1, 3, 4, 6>: Chord = (3, 4)
- <1, 5, 6, 4>: Chord = (5, 6)
- <0, 7, 9, 0>: Chord = (7, 9)
- <3, 4, 9, 3>: Chord = (4, 9)
- <8, 9, 2, 8>: Chord = (9, 2)
- <5, 8, 9, 5>: Chord = (8, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [8]
