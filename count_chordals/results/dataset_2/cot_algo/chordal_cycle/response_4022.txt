Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 1) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 3) (5, 8) (5, 14) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 19) (15, 9) (15, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (12, 17) (12, 15) (12, 8) (19, 14) (19, 16) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (3, 18) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (6, 2, 11, 17, 6)
- (9, 15, 12, 17, 9)
- (10, 17, 12, 15, 10)
- (7, 10, 14, 19, 7)
- (1, 9, 15, 12, 1)
- (16, 9, 1, 0, 16)
- (13, 6, 2, 18, 13)
- (18, 11, 6, 2, 18)
- (14, 10, 17, 12, 14)
- (5, 8, 12, 17, 5)
- (19, 14, 10, 17, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <6, 2, 11, 17> (chord: (6, 11))
- <9, 15, 12, 17> (chord: (9, 15))
- <10, 17, 12, 15> (chord: (10, 15))
- <7, 10, 14, 19> (chord: (7, 14))
- <1, 9, 15, 12> (chord: (1, 12))
- <16, 9, 1, 0> (chord: (16, 0))
- <13, 6, 2, 18> (chord: (13, 18))
- <18, 11, 6, 2> (chord: (18, 2))
- <14, 10, 17, 12> (chord: (14, 12))
- <5, 8, 12, 17> (chord: (5, 17))
- <19, 14, 10, 17> (chord: (19, 17))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
