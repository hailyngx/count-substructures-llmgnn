Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 5) (14, 16) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 19) (5, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 4) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 0) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 8) (18, 7) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 13) (3, 17) (1, 11) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 15) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (11, 1, 4, 17, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 1, 4, 19, 11)
- Cycle 3: (16, 0, 8, 19, 16)
- Cycle 4: (16, 0, 8, 5, 16)
- Cycle 5: (16, 14, 17, 4, 16)
- Cycle 6: (6, 9, 2, 5, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 9, 2, 4, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 7, 13, 12, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 7, 13, 15, 6)
- Cycle 10: (9, 2, 4, 17, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 2, 4, 19, 9)
- Cycle 12: (7, 18, 7)
- Cycle 13: (12, 13, 15, 6, 12)
- Cycle 14: (12, 13, 15, 17, 12)
- Cycle 15: (12, 19, 4, 17, 12)
- Cycle 16: (5, 19, 4, 17, 5)
- Cycle 17: (5, 2, 10, 2, 5)
- Cycle 18: (19, 8, 0, 16, 19)
- Cycle 19: (19, 8, 0, 11, 19)
- Cycle 20: (19, 8, 5, 16, 19)

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 17), 11>
- <1, (4, 19), 11>
- <16, (0, 8), 19>
- <16, (0, 8), 5>
- <16, (14, 17), 4>
- <6, (9, 2), 5>
- <6, (7, 13), 12>
- <6, (7, 13), 15>
- <9, (2, 4), 17>
- <9, (2, 4), 19>
- <12, (13, 15), 6>
- <12, (13, 15), 17>
- <12, (19, 4), 17>
- <5, (19, 4), 17>
- <19, (8, 0), 16>
- <19, (8, 0), 11>
- <19, (8, 5), 16>

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [16]
