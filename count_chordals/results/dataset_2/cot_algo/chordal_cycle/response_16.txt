Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 15) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 16) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 3) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 7) (15, 5) (15, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 16) (10, 6) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 19) (7, 17) (16, 9) (16, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 13) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 8, 1, 9)
- Cycle 3: (2, 3, 4, 2)
- Cycle 4: (6, 3, 4, 6)
- Cycle 5: (18, 0, 14, 18)
- Cycle 6: (0, 11, 13, 0)
- Cycle 7: (14, 12, 11, 14)
  
Step 2:
Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Checking Cycle 1: (5, 1, 8, 5) has exactly one chord (1, 8) => Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (1, 8), 5)>
- Checking Cycle 2: (9, 8, 1, 9) has no chord
- Checking Cycle 3: (2, 3, 4, 2) has no chord
- Checking Cycle 4: (6, 3, 4, 6) has no chord
- Checking Cycle 5: (18, 0, 14, 18) has no chord
- Checking Cycle 6: (0, 11, 13, 0) has no chord
- Checking Cycle 7: (14, 12, 11, 14) has no chord

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]
