Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 4 - 5
2. Cycle 2: 5 - 2 - 1 - 5
3. Cycle 3: 5 - 2 - 3 - 5
4. Cycle 4: 5 - 0 - 9 - 5
5. Cycle 5: 9 - 5 - 2 - 9
6. Cycle 6: 6 - 5 - 2 - 6
7. Cycle 7: 6 - 7 - 8 - 6
8. Cycle 8: 2 - 5 - 6 - 2
9. Cycle 9: 2 - 8 - 7 - 2
10. Cycle 10: 8 - 6 - 7 - 8
11. Cycle 11: 0 - 5 - 1 - 0
12. Cycle 12: 0 - 9 - 4 - 0
13. Cycle 13: 7 - 6 - 3 - 7
14. Cycle 14: 7 - 2 - 8 - 7
15. Cycle 15: 1 - 5 - 4 - 1
16. Cycle 16: 3 - 6 - 8 - 3
17. Cycle 17: 3 - 0 - 9 - 3
18. Cycle 18: 3 - 2 - 1 - 3
19. Cycle 19: 4 - 5 - 1 - 4
20. Cycle 20: 4 - 9 - 0 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <1, (2, 3), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles found is [19].
