Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 12) (10, 18) (10, 13) (12, 6) (12, 18) (12, 1) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 19) (2, 9) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 9) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 19) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 18) (18, 16) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: (5, 6, 12, 1)
2. Cycle 2: (5, 6, 8, 4)
3. Cycle 3: (5, 6, 3, 9)
4. Cycle 4: (5, 17, 16, 11)
5. Cycle 5: (5, 17, 7, 1)
6. Cycle 6: (5, 14, 18, 16)
7. Cycle 7: (5, 14, 15, 4)
8. Cycle 8: (6, 12, 18, 16)
9. Cycle 9: (6, 12, 1, 7)
10. Cycle 10: (6, 3, 9, 2)
11. Cycle 11: (16, 11, 0, 13)
12. Cycle 12: (16, 11, 16, 17)
13. Cycle 13: (16, 11, 0, 13)
14. Cycle 14: (16, 17, 7, 19)
15. Cycle 15: (16, 17, 5, 14)
16. Cycle 16: (16, 18, 12, 6)
17. Cycle 17: (16, 18, 10, 13)
18. Cycle 18: (16, 18, 8, 4)
19. Cycle 19: (16, 18, 14, 5)
20. Cycle 20: (18, 16, 11, 0)
21. Cycle 21: (18, 16, 17, 7)
22. Cycle 22: (18, 14, 15, 4)
23. Cycle 23: (0, 13, 10, 18)
24. Cycle 24: (13, 10, 18, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<5, (6, 12), 1>
<5, (6, 8), 4>
<5, (6, 3), 9>
<5, (17, 16), 11>
<5, (17, 7), 1>
<5, (14, 18), 16>
<6, (12, 18), 16>
<6, (12, 1), 7>
<6, (3, 9), 2>
<16, (11, 0), 13>
<16, (11, 16), 17>
<16, (17, 7), 19>
<16, (17, 5), 14>
<16, (18, 12), 6>
<16, (18, 10), 13>
<16, (18, 8), 4>
<16, (18, 14), 5>
<18, (16, 11), 0>
<18, (16, 17), 7>
<18, (14, 15), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final count is [20].
