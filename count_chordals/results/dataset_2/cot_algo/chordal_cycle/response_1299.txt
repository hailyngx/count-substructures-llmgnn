Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 5, 6, 8, 3) with edges (3, 5), (5, 6), (6, 8), (8, 3)
- Cycle 2: (4, 5, 7, 4) with edges (4, 5), (5, 7), (7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (0, 9, 4, 0) with edges (0, 9), (9, 4), (4, 0)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 7, 8, 1) with edges (1, 3), (3, 7), (7, 8), (8, 1)
- Cycle 5: (0, 6, 8, 0) with edges (0, 6), (6, 8), (8, 0)
- Cycle 6: (2, 1, 8, 2) with edges (2, 1), (1, 8), (8, 2)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord
- Cycle 2 has no chord
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has one chord (3, 8)
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has no chord

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found = [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <3, (5, 6), 8>
