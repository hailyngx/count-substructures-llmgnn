Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- <1, 3, 5, 4>
- <1, 5, 8, 3>
- <1, 7, 10, 8>
- <1, 9, 13, 6>
- <1, 12, 10, 7>
- <1, 14, 6, 0>
- <3, 5, 14, 6>
- <3, 11, 6, 13>
- <3, 8, 2, 9>
- <4, 5, 8, 10>
- <4, 12, 10, 7>
- <5, 8, 2, 9>
- <5, 14, 6, 0>
- <6, 11, 3, 8>
- <6, 13, 9, 2>
- <6, 14, 5, 4>
- <7, 10, 8, 5>
- <10, 12, 4, 0>
- <11, 6, 13, 9>
- <12, 10, 7, 1>

Step 2:
- <1, 5, 8, 3> has exactly one chord (1, 8).
- <1, 7, 10, 8> has exactly one chord (7, 10).
- <1, 12, 10, 7> has exactly one chord (12, 10).
- <3, 8, 2, 9> has exactly one chord (8, 9).
- <4, 12, 10, 7> has exactly one chord (12, 10).
- <6, 11, 3, 8> has exactly one chord (11, 8).

Step 3:
We found 6 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [6].
