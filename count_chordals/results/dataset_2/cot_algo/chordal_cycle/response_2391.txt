Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 18) (0, 8) (0, 13) (13, 0) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 18) (16, 2) (16, 12) (9, 17) (9, 18) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 5) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 19) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 10) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 10) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 15) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 5) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 19, 11, 2, 4, 1) 
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 2, 16, 12, 6, 7, 15, 17, 14, 9, 18, 3, 1) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has the chord (19, 4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [1] unique chordal 4-cycle found:

- <1, 3, 19, 11, 2, 4, 1>
