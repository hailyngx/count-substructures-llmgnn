Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 18) (7, 18) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 18) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 17) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (16, 0) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 17) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 2) (19, 3) (19, 15) (6, 17) (6, 2) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 13) (14, 3) (14, 10) (8, 15) (8, 17) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 5-1-3-9-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-12-17-5
- Cycle 3: 5-2-6-17-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-13-7-18-17-5
- Cycle 5: 9-3-1-5-9
- Cycle 6: 9-11-18-17-5-9
- Cycle 7: 3-1-12-17-6-2-3
- Cycle 8: 10-14-3-1-13-7-18-10
- Cycle 9: 11-0-16-0-10-11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Only Cycle 1 (5-1-3-9-5) has exactly one chord (2, 3) connecting non-adjacent nodes 2 and 3.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- Chordless cycles: <5, 1, 12, 17>, <9, 11, 18, 17>, <3, 1, 12, 17, 6, 2>, <10, 14, 3, 1, 13, 7, 18>, <11, 0, 16, 0, 10>
- Total number of chordless 4-cycles = [5].
