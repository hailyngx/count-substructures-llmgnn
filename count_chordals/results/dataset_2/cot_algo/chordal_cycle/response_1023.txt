Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: (3, 5, 4, 11, 3)
        - Cycle 2: (3, 7, 6, 4, 11, 3)
        - Cycle 3: (4, 13, 0, 11, 4)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 9, 0, 11, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (6, 13, 4, 11, 6)
        - Cycle 6: (8, 10, 0, 13, 8)
        - Cycle 7: (12, 1, 7, 3, 12)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord: (3, 4)
        - Cycle 2 has a chord: (7, 4)
        - Cycle 3 has a chord: (0, 13)
        - Cycle 4 has a chord: (9, 0)
        - Cycle 5 has a chord: (4, 11)
        - Cycle 6 has a chord: (0, 13)
        - Cycle 7 has a chord: (3, 7)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        - There are 0 chordless cycles.
        
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        <3, 4, (5, 9)>
        <7, 4, (3, 7)>
        <0, 13, (4, 11)>
        <9, 0, (5, 11)>
        <4, 11, (5, 3)>
        <0, 13, (8, 10)>
        <3, 7, (1, 12)>
