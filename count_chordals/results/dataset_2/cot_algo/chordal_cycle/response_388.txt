Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 5) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 5) (13, 17) (13, 1) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 6) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 3) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 0) (5, 12) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 4) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (10, 11, 2, 7, 18, 15, 17, 10)
- Cycle 2: (10, 17, 13, 1, 4, 2, 11, 10)
- Cycle 3: (11, 9, 3, 7, 18, 15, 17, 11)
- Cycle 4: (17, 15, 5, 12, 6, 0, 5, 15)
- Cycle 5: (17, 4, 16, 5, 12, 6, 14, 4)
- Cycle 6: (13, 1, 18, 15, 5, 12, 6, 14, 13)
- Cycle 7: (9, 11, 2, 4, 14, 19, 12, 5, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (7, 18)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (13, 1)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (12, 6)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (5, 12)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (15, 5)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (2, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (7, 18)> and the count of chordless cycles is [0].
