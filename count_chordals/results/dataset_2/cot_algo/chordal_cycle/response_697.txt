Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 6) (8, 9) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 19) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 14) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 6) (5, 2) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles with length 4 are:
1. (4, 7, 15, 18, 4)
2. (4, 7, 16, 12, 4)
3. (7, 4, 16, 12, 7)
4. (7, 0, 17, 11, 7)
5. (7, 16, 12, 17, 7)
6. (10, 4, 16, 12, 10)
7. (10, 9, 14, 18, 10)
8. (11, 13, 12, 17, 11)
9. (18, 14, 9, 10, 18)
10. (18, 15, 7, 4, 18)
11. (0, 7, 16, 12, 0)
12. (0, 17, 11, 13, 0)
13. (0, 19, 6, 1, 0)
14. (8, 9, 14, 18, 8)
15. (9, 10, 16, 12, 9)
16. (16, 4, 17, 11, 16)
17. (2, 5, 19, 6, 2)
18. (12, 16, 4, 10, 12)
19. (1, 2, 5, 19, 1)
20. (6, 0, 7, 15, 6)
21. (15, 7, 14, 9, 15)
22. (19, 0, 17, 11, 19)
23. (5, 2, 1, 6, 5)
24. (3, 18, 14, 9, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (0, 19), 6)>
- <2, (19, 6), 5)>
- <3, (14, 9), 18)>
- <4, (7, 15), 18)>
- <5, (1, 2), 19)>
- <6, (0, 17), 11)>
- <7, (16, 12), 4)>
- <8, (9, 14), 18)>
- <9, (16, 12), 7)>
- <10, (4, 7), 16)>
- <11, (14, 18), 9)>
- <12, (17, 11), 0)>
- <13, (7, 16), 12)>
- <14, (12, 17), 11)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are: 14.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [14].
