Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 4) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Here are the cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- (1, 3, 5, 2)
- (1, 9, 8, 12)
- (1, 10, 14, 11)
- (3, 4, 2, 5)
- (3, 5, 11, 14)
- (5, 6, 4, 2)
- (5, 11, 14, 10)
- (6, 4, 2, 5)
- (0, 2, 5, 11)
- (0, 9, 1, 12)
- (0, 10, 14, 5)
- (2, 4, 13, 5)
- (2, 8, 11, 3)
- (8, 9, 1, 10)
- (8, 12, 1, 0)
- (11, 3, 4, 14)
- (11, 8, 2, 5)
- (9, 0, 2, 5)
- (10, 1, 9, 8)
- (7, 3, 4, 11)
- (12, 0, 2, 5)
- (13, 2, 4, 3)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (3, 5), 2>
- <5, (6, 4), 2>
- <11, (14, 10), 5>
- <0, (9, 1), 12>
- <8, (11, 3), 2>
- <8, (9, 1), 10>
- <11, (3, 4), 14>

Step 3:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
