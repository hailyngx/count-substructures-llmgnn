Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 3) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 15) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 24) (22, 18) (22, 29) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 15) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 29) (13, 6) (23, 26) (23, 9) (12, 7) (12, 24) (12, 25) (17, 19) (29, 22) (29, 13) (29, 5) (26, 4) (26, 23) (28, 8) (28, 2) (28, 15) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 10) (21, 6) (21, 25) (27, 11) (27, 4) (27, 10) (27, 3) (10, 6) (10, 27) (10, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 20) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 25) (0, 10) (0, 25) (0, 5) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 23) (5, 29) (5, 0) (3, 16) (3, 27) (3, 14) (24, 18) (24, 12) (24, 2) (24, 20) (1, 2) (2, 28) (2, 24) (2, 1) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 28) (25, 13) (25, 12) (25, 21) (25, 19) (25, 0) (20, 14) (20, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1: (13, 29, 5, 0, 10, 27, 3, 14, 20, 24, 2, 28, 15, 8, 13)
2. Cycle 2: (9, 23, 26, 4, 13, 25, 19, 17, 19, 25, 0, 5, 29, 22, 18)
3. Cycle 3: (18, 22, 29, 5, 0, 10, 27, 4, 26, 23, 9, 18, 24, 20)
4. Cycle 4: (0, 10, 6, 13, 4, 27, 11, 16, 3, 14, 20, 24, 2, 1, 2, 28)
5. Cycle 5: (25, 19, 17, 19, 25, 13, 4, 9, 23, 26, 4, 13, 8, 15, 18)
6. Cycle 6: (15, 7, 12, 24, 20, 14, 3, 27, 4, 26, 23, 9, 18, 15, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has one chord <13, 6>.
- Cycle 2 has one chord <23, 9>.
- Cycle 3 has one chord <22, 29>.
- Cycle 4 has one chord <10, 27>.
- Cycle 5 has one chord <19, 25>.
- Cycle 6 has one chord <7, 15>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
