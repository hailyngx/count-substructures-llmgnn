Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 6, 3, 5> with edges (5, 1), (1, 6), (6, 3), (3, 5), (5, 1)
- Cycle 2: <9, 4, 6, 8, 9> with edges (9, 4), (4, 6), (6, 8), (8, 9), (9, 4)
- Cycle 3: <7, 0, 4, 6, 7> with edges (7, 0), (0, 4), (4, 6), (6, 7), (7, 0)
- Cycle 4: <2, 6, 8, 9, 2> with edges (2, 6), (6, 8), (8, 9), (9, 2), (2, 6)

Step 2:
Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <1, 3> (5, 1, 3, 5) -> <1, (3), 3>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <4, 8> (9, 4, 8, 9) -> <4, (8), 9>
- Cycle 3 has a chord <0, 6> (7, 0, 6, 7) -> <0, (6), 4>
- Cycle 4 has a chord <6, 8> (2, 6, 8, 9) -> <6, (8), 2>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <5, (1), 3>
- <9, (8), 4>
- <7, (6), 0>
- <2, (8), 6>
