Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more, we find the following chordless cycles:
<1, 10, 11, 9>
<1, 13, 0, 11>
<1, 13, 14, 7>
<1, 4, 6, 8>
<2, 8, 6, 4>
<10, 11, 0, 13>
<11, 0, 14, 7>
<3, 4, 2, 8>
<3, 4, 6, 1>
<5, 3, 12, 7>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, 4, (6, 8), 10>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 9 chordless cycles. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
