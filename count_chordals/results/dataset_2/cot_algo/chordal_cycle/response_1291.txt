Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 7, 1, 13>
<0, 7, 10, 14>
<0, 2, 6, 5>
<2, 6, 5, 13>
<3, 0, 7, 10>
<3, 0, 7, 14>
<3, 2, 6, 5>
<3, 2, 6, 10>
<4, 8, 6, 5>
<4, 8, 2, 6>
<4, 14, 10, 7>
<4, 14, 7, 0>
<5, 13, 2, 6>
<5, 13, 3, 0>
<5, 12, 8, 6>
<5, 11, 6, 2>
<6, 2, 3, 0>
<6, 5, 12, 8>
<7, 0, 3, 2>
<7, 0, 14, 10>
<7, 1, 13, 5>
<7, 14, 10, 6>
<8, 4, 14, 10>
<8, 4, 14, 7>
<8, 2, 6, 5>
<8, 12, 5, 13>
<9, 11, 6, 2>
<10, 14, 7, 0>
<10, 14, 4, 8>
<11, 5, 12, 8>
<11, 6, 2, 3>
<12, 8, 4, 14>
<12, 5, 13, 2>
<13, 5, 12, 8>
<13, 5, 6, 11>
<14, 10, 7, 0>
<14, 10, 6, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 7, 1, 13> (Chord: 7, 13)
<0, 2, 6, 5> (Chord: 2, 6)
<3, 0, 7, 10> (Chord: 0, 7)
<3, 2, 6, 5> (Chord: 2, 6)
<4, 8, 6, 5> (Chord: 6, 8)
<4, 14, 10, 7> (Chord: 10, 14)
<5, 12, 8, 6> (Chord: 8, 12)
<5, 11, 6, 2> (Chord: 6, 11)
<6, 2, 3, 0> (Chord: 2, 3)
<7, 1, 13, 5> (Chord: 1, 13)
<8, 4, 14, 10> (Chord: 14, 4)
<9, 11, 6, 2> (Chord: 6, 11)
<11, 5, 12, 8> (Chord: 5, 12)
<12, 8, 4, 14> (Chord: 8, 14)
<13, 5, 12, 8> (Chord: 5, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [14] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
