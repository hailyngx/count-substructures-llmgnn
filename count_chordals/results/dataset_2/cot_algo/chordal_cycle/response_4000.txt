Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (5, 9, 7, 4, 5)
- (5, 4, 0, 1, 5)
- (5, 2, 4, 7, 5)
- (5, 8, 7, 9, 5)
- (9, 5, 4, 0, 9)
- (9, 7, 2, 6, 9)
- (4, 5, 9, 7, 4)
- (4, 7, 2, 6, 4)
- (7, 9, 2, 4, 7)
- (1, 4, 7, 8, 1)
- (1, 3, 8, 5, 1)
- (3, 1, 4, 0, 3)
- (6, 9, 7, 8, 6)
- (2, 5, 8, 1, 2)
- (8, 5, 0, 6, 8)
- (0, 5, 2, 6, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chord <5, 9> in cycle (5, 9, 7, 4, 5)
- Chord <4, 0> in cycle (5, 4, 0, 1, 5)
- Chord <2, 7> in cycle (5, 2, 4, 7, 5)
- Chord <8, 7> in cycle (5, 8, 7, 9, 5)
- Chord <4, 0> in cycle (9, 5, 4, 0, 9)
- Chord <7, 2> in cycle (9, 7, 2, 6, 9)
- Chord <9, 7> in cycle (4, 5, 9, 7, 4)
- Chord <6, 2> in cycle (4, 7, 2, 6, 4)
- Chord <2, 4> in cycle (7, 9, 2, 4, 7)
- Chord <1, 7> in cycle (1, 4, 7, 8, 1)
- Chord <8, 3> in cycle (1, 3, 8, 5, 1)
- Chord <0, 4> in cycle (3, 1, 4, 0, 3)
- Chord <9, 8> in cycle (6, 9, 7, 8, 6)
- Chord <5, 1> in cycle (2, 5, 8, 1, 2)
- Chord <0, 6> in cycle (8, 5, 0, 6, 8)
- Chord <5, 6> in cycle (0, 5, 2, 6, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0].
