This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 8) (13, 12) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 15) (22, 24) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 25) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 15) (5, 27) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 20) (17, 16) (29, 15) (29, 12) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 27) (24, 22) (24, 21) (24, 14) (24, 23) (26, 22) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 4) (28, 14) (28, 2) (18, 3) (18, 16) (18, 10) (19, 0) (19, 23) (2, 22) (2, 28) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 19) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 20) (11, 8) (14, 24) (14, 28) (14, 12) (14, 25) (25, 1) (25, 14) (25, 4) (23, 5) (23, 24) (23, 19) (20, 6) (20, 21) (20, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (15, 22) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 15) (12, 13) (12, 29) (12, 14) (12, 9) (27, 1) (27, 5) (27, 21) (4, 3) (4, 16) (4, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle <1, 3, 10, 20>
2. Cycle <1, 3, 18, 16>
3. Cycle <1, 6, 5, 23>
4. Cycle <1, 27, 21, 24>
5. Cycle <3, 1, 6, 5>
6. Cycle <3, 1, 27, 21>
7. Cycle <3, 18, 16, 4>
8. Cycle <8, 13, 12, 29>
9. Cycle <8, 13, 12, 14>
10. Cycle <8, 13, 12, 9>
11. Cycle <8, 13, 12, 29>
12. Cycle <8, 11, 14, 24>
13. Cycle <8, 11, 14, 25>
14. Cycle <8, 11, 14, 28>
15. Cycle <8, 0, 19, 23>
16. Cycle <8, 0, 19, 23>
17. Cycle <8, 7, 2, 28>
18. Cycle <8, 7, 2, 22>
19. Cycle <5, 6, 1, 25>
20. Cycle <5, 6, 1, 27>
21. Cycle <5, 6, 20, 21>
22. Cycle <5, 15, 7, 2>
23. Cycle <5, 15, 29, 12>
24. Cycle <15, 22, 26, 16>
25. Cycle <15, 22, 24, 14>
26. Cycle <15, 22, 24, 23>
27. Cycle <15, 5, 6, 1>
28. Cycle <15, 5, 6, 20>
29. Cycle <15, 5, 27, 21>
30. Cycle <15, 7, 2, 22>
31. Cycle <15, 7, 8, 11>
32. Cycle <15, 29, 12, 13>
33. Cycle <5, 6, 20, 10>
34. Cycle <29, 12, 13, 8>
35. Cycle <29, 12, 14, 24>
36. Cycle <29, 15, 22, 24>
37. Cycle <29, 15, 5, 6>
38. Cycle <21, 24, 22, 26>
39. Cycle <21, 24, 23, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Checking the cycles, we find that cycles 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19, 23, 24, 26, 27, and 37 have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 28 chordless 4-cycles in the graph, so the final answer is [28].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, 27, 21, 24>
