Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 15) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 7) (3, 14) (3, 16) (11, 12) (11, 1) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 5) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (16, 3) (16, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (5, 17) (5, 1) (5, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 18, 4, 8, 13, 19, 14) 
- Cycle 2: (6, 17, 14, 3, 16, 10, 2, 7) 
- Cycle 3: (6, 17, 5, 2, 7, 12, 4, 18) 
- Cycle 4: (6, 0, 12, 4, 18, 9, 17, 14) 
- Cycle 5: (9, 18, 4, 12, 11, 1, 14, 17) 
- Cycle 6: (14, 3, 16, 10, 15, 17, 6, 9) 
- Cycle 7: (17, 5, 2, 10, 15, 1, 11, 12) 
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 13, 19, 14, 1, 11, 12) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (8, 14) 
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (14, 7) 
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (7, 17) 
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (0, 6) 
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (18, 17) 
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (3, 9) 
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (5, 12) 
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (13, 4) 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are no chordless 4-cycles in this graph. 

Final result: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<1, (8, 14)>
<2, (14, 7)>
<3, (7, 17)>
<4, (0, 6)>
<5, (18, 17)>
<6, (3, 9)>
<7, (5, 12)>
<8, (13, 4)>
