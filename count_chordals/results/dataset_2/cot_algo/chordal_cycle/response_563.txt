Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 7, 4, 6, 1>
- <0, 7, 14, 11, 12>
- <1, 6, 4, 8, 2>
- <1, 6, 14, 7, 5>
- <1, 7, 5, 8, 2>
- <2, 1, 6, 14, 11>
- <2, 8, 4, 6, 1>
- <2, 8, 3, 10, 13>
- <3, 10, 13, 1, 7>
- <4, 6, 1, 7, 5>
- <4, 7, 14, 11, 12>
- <5, 7, 14, 11, 13>
- <5, 8, 4, 6, 1>
- <6, 1, 7, 14, 11>
- <7, 1, 2, 8, 5>
- <7, 5, 14, 11, 13>
- <8, 4, 6, 1, 2>
- <8, 5, 7, 14, 11>
- <10, 3, 8, 2, 1>
- <10, 3, 13, 1, 7>
- <11, 14, 7, 5, 8>
- <13, 11, 14, 7, 5>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 7, 4, 6, 1> has chord (7, 6)
- <0, 7, 14, 11, 12> has chord (7, 11)
- <1, 6, 4, 8, 2> has chord (6, 8)
- <1, 6, 14, 7, 5> has chord (6, 7)
- <1, 7, 5, 8, 2> has chord (7, 8)
- <2, 1, 6, 14, 11> has chord (1, 14)
- <2, 8, 4, 6, 1> has chord (8, 6)
- <2, 8, 3, 10, 13> has chord (8, 10)
- <3, 10, 13, 1, 7> has chord (10, 1)
- <4, 6, 1, 7, 5> has chord (6, 7)
- <5, 7, 14, 11, 13> has chord (7, 11)
- <8, 5, 7, 14, 11> has chord (5, 14)
- <13, 11, 14, 7, 5> has chord (11, 7)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [13]
