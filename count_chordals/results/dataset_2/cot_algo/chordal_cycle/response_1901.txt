Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle (5, 9, 3, 2, 5)
2. Cycle (5, 9, 6, 7, 5)
3. Cycle (5, 4, 7, 6, 5)
4. Cycle (5, 4, 0, 2, 5)
5. Cycle (9, 6, 7, 4, 9)
6. Cycle (9, 6, 3, 2, 9)
7. Cycle (9, 7, 4, 0, 9)
8. Cycle (6, 7, 4, 5, 6)
9. Cycle (6, 7, 0, 2, 6)
10. Cycle (4, 7, 0, 5, 4)
11. Cycle (4, 7, 6, 9, 4)
12. Cycle (4, 0, 2, 5, 4)
13. Cycle (7, 0, 2, 5, 7)
14. Cycle (7, 0, 8, 2, 7)
15. Cycle (7, 4, 5, 6, 7)
16. Cycle (2, 5, 4, 0, 2)
17. Cycle (2, 5, 9, 6, 2)
18. Cycle (8, 0, 2, 5, 8)
19. Cycle (8, 0, 7, 6, 8)
20. Cycle (8, 7, 6, 9, 8)
21. Cycle (0, 2, 5, 4, 0)
22. Cycle (0, 2, 8, 7, 0)
23. Cycle (0, 7, 4, 5, 0)
24. Cycle (0, 7, 6, 9, 0)
25. Cycle (1, 4, 7, 0, 1)
26. Cycle (1, 4, 5, 9, 1)
27. Cycle (3, 9, 6, 7, 3)
28. Cycle (3, 9, 6, 5, 3)
29. Cycle (3, 6, 7, 4, 3)
30. Cycle (3, 2, 5, 9, 3)
31. Cycle (3, 2, 0, 7, 3)
32. Cycle (3, 8, 0, 7, 3)
33. Cycle (3, 8, 2, 5, 3)

Now, let's identify the chordal 4-cycles in the graph:

- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 9, (2, 6), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 4, (0, 7), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle <9, 6, (7, 4), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 5, (4, 0), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle <8, 0, (2, 7), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 9, (6, 7), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 2, (5, 9), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 8, (0, 7), 3>

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
