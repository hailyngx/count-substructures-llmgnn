Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <3, 11, 16, 7>: Chord = (16, 7)
- <5, 9, 6, 8>: Chord = (9, 6)
- <5, 16, 7, 17>: Chord = (7, 16)
- <6, 9, 5, 16>: Chord = (9, 5)
- <10, 6, 19, 2>: Chord = (6, 19)
- <17, 5, 16, 7>: Chord = (5, 16)
- <12, 16, 7, 17>: Chord = (16, 7)
- <13, 0, 14, 9>: Chord = (0, 14)
- <19, 6, 9, 5>: Chord = (6, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- Number of chordal 4-cycles = [9]
