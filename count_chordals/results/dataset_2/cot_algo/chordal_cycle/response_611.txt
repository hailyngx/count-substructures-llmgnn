Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (16, 11) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 18) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 19) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 9) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 2) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 12) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <3, 11, 16, 11, 3>
        - <3, 11, 19, 2, 15>
        - <3, 8, 14, 7, 4>
        - <3, 8, 18, 1, 17>
        - <7, 4, 17, 1, 18>
        - <9, 4, 17, 1, 5>
        - <9, 12, 2, 15, 13>
        - <9, 12, 10, 19, 11>
        - <9, 10, 19, 2, 6>
        - <5, 12, 2, 13, 8>
        
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Chordal cycle: <3, 11, 16, 11, 3> (Chord: (3, 16))
        - Chordal cycle: <9, 12, 10, 19, 11> (Chord: (12, 10))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        - <3, 11, 16, 11, 3> (Chord: (3, 16))
        - <9, 12, 10, 19, 11> (Chord: (12, 10))
