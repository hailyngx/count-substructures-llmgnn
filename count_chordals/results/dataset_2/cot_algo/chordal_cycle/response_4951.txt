Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-7-1
- Cycle 2: 1-2-3-0
- Cycle 3: 3-4-0-5
- Cycle 4: 4-6-7-1
- Cycle 5: 2-6-4-3
- Cycle 6: 0-1-7-5
- Cycle 7: 2-8-1-7
- Cycle 8: 2-6-9-4
- Cycle 9: 3-8-1-7
- Cycle 10: 4-9-6-2

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (3, 0), 7> with chord (3, 0)
- <1, (8, 2), 7> with chord (8, 2)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [8]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, (6, 7), 4>
<1, (8, 2), 7>
<2, (6, 9), 4>
<3, (8, 1), 7>
<4, (6, 7), 1>
<5, (7, 1), 0>
<6, (9, 2), 4>
<7, (9, 6), 2>
