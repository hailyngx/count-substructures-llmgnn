Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 6) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 8)

- Cycle 30: 11-1-6-11
- Cycle 31: 11-9-0-11
- Cycle 32: 11-9-12-11
- Cycle 33: 2-5-13-2
- Cycle 34: 2-5-11-2
- Cycle 35: 2-9-14-2
- Cycle 36: 2-9-12-2
- Cycle 37: 12-6-8-12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, 10, (5, 9)>
- Chordal cycle 2: <2, 5, (9, 14)>
- Chordal cycle 3: <1, 4, (5, 13)>
- Chordal cycle 4: <2, 9, (13, 14)>
- Chordal cycle 5: <1, 11, (9, 14)>
- Chordal cycle 6: <4, 7, (1, 3)>
- Chordal cycle 7: <6, 8, (3, 12)>
- Chordal cycle 8: <0, 9, (14, 12)>
- Chordal cycle 9: <4, 13, (5, 2)>
- Chordal cycle 10: <1, 6, (3, 8)>
- Chordal cycle 11: <9, 11, (1, 14)>
- Chordal cycle 12: <4, 7, (1, 3)>
- Chordal cycle 13: <1, 6, (3, 8)>
- Chordal cycle 14: <9, 11, (1, 14)>
- Chordal cycle 15: <2, 13, (5, 9)>
- Chordal cycle 16: <2, 5, (9, 14)>
- Chordal cycle 17: <2, 13, (5, 9)>
- Chordal cycle 18: <6, 12, (8, 10)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.
There are 18 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [18].
