Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-6-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-7-9-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-2-1-0
- Cycle 4: 1-2-3-5-1
- Cycle 5: 1-5-8-2-1
- Cycle 6: 2-8-5-3-2
- Cycle 7: 3-6-4-5-3

Step 2: 
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes):
- Cycle 1 has a chord 6-8.
- Cycle 2 has a chord 7-9.
- Cycle 3 has a chord 2-1.
- Cycle 4 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 5 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 6 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 7 has a chord 4-5.

Step 3: 
Number of chordless cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <0, 4, 7, 9>
