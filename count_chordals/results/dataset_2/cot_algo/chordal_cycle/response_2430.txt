Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-3-4-7
- Cycle 2: 5-1-3-4-7
- Cycle 3: 5-1-3-6-2
- Cycle 4: 5-1-9-8-2
- Cycle 5: 5-1-9-8-3
- Cycle 6: 5-7-4-3-1
- Cycle 7: 5-7-4-3-6
- Cycle 8: 5-7-2-6-0
- Cycle 9: 5-7-2-6-3
- Cycle 10: 5-0-1-3-9
- Cycle 11: 5-0-1-3-6
- Cycle 12: 5-0-6-2-7

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with one chord are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (1, 3), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (1, 9), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (7, 4), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (7, 2), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (0, 1), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, (0, 6), 2>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 6, so the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [6].
