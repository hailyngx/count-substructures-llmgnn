Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 10, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 10, 12, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 10, 1, 7, 6, 3, 14, 2, 5, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 6, 3, 9, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 9, 3, 6, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 13, 11, 2, 14, 3, 6, 7)
- Cycle 7: (1, 10, 12, 2, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 8: (3, 14, 2, 12, 13, 9, 3)
- Cycle 9: (10, 1, 7, 6, 2, 14, 5, 10)
- Cycle 10: (10, 5, 2, 12, 13, 11, 10)
- Cycle 11: (10, 12, 2, 14, 5, 10)
- Cycle 12: (11, 13, 9, 3, 6, 2, 14, 11)
- Cycle 13: (2, 5, 14, 3, 6, 7, 1, 10, 11, 2)
- Cycle 14: (2, 6, 7, 1, 10, 5, 14, 2)
- Cycle 15: (2, 8, 9, 3, 6, 7, 1, 10, 11, 2)
- Cycle 16: (8, 9, 3, 14, 2, 12, 13, 11, 10, 8)
- Cycle 17: (0, 11, 13, 9, 3, 6, 7, 1, 10, 0)
- Cycle 18: (0, 8, 9, 3, 14, 2, 12, 13, 11, 0)
- Cycle 19: (14, 3, 6, 7, 1, 10, 5, 2, 12, 14)
- Cycle 20: (5, 4, 10, 1, 7, 6, 3, 9, 13, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <4, (5, 10), 4>
- Cycle 2: <4, (10, 12), 4>
- Cycle 4: <7, (6, 9), 7>
- Cycle 5: <7, (9, 3), 6, 7>
- Cycle 6: <7, (13, 11), 2, 14, 3, 6, 7>
- Cycle 8: <3, (14, 2), 12, 13, 9, 3>
- Cycle 9: <10, (1, 7), 6, 2, 14, 5, 10>
- Cycle 10: <10, (5, 2), 12, 13, 11, 10>
- Cycle 12: <11, (13, 9), 3, 6, 2, 14, 11>
- Cycle 14: <2, (6, 7), 1, 10, 5, 14, 2>
- Cycle 19: <14, (3, 6), 7, 1, 10, 5, 2, 12, 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are [10] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
