Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:  
- Cycle 1: 1-3-7-5
- Cycle 2: 1-2-4-6
- Cycle 3: 1-2-8-5
- Cycle 4: 1-6-4-9
- Cycle 5: 1-6-9-8
- Cycle 6: 1-9-4-6
- Cycle 7: 3-1-6-4
- Cycle 8: 3-7-5-0
- Cycle 9: 3-7-6-1
- Cycle 10: 3-9-6-0
- Cycle 11: 4-6-9-1
- Cycle 12: 4-7-3-1
- Cycle 13: 4-9-6-0
- Cycle 14: 5-0-8-2

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord to form a chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (6, 9), 4>
- Chordal cycle 2: <1, (2, 8), 5>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are <1, (6, 9), 4> and <1, (2, 8), 5>.
