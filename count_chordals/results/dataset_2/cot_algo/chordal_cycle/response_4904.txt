The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 1) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (7, 10) (7, 16) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 19) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 5) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 16) (5, 2) (9, 3) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 0)

- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (6, 2), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (10, 7), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <10, (3, 19), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <12, (3, 13), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <13, (19, 4), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <16, (5, 2), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <18, (1, 15), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <19, (11, 16), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
