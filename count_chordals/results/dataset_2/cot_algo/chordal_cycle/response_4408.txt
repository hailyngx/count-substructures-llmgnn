Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 4) (22, 25) (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 23) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 19) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 19) (6, 28) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (7, 12) (7, 17) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 21) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 16) (21, 12) (21, 24) (24, 21) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 15) (5, 19) (5, 26) (19, 28) (19, 29) (19, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 18) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 23) (20, 27) (20, 29) (10, 1) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 26) (15, 25) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 3) (26, 5) (26, 8) (26, 15) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 2) (25, 22) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 18) (11, 6) (11, 18) (2, 27) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 2) (23, 27) (23, 17) (23, 9) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 25) (18, 11) 

Response:
Step 1:  
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:  
   - Cycle 1: 27-29-28-6-27
   - Cycle 2: 27-20-29-19-27
   - Cycle 3: 27-23-17-1-14-6-27
   - Cycle 4: 27-23-17-15-26-5-19-28-6-27
   - Cycle 5: 27-0-27-23-17-15-26-8-18-1-27 
   - Cycle 6: 27-0-27-23-17-15-26-5-19-29-27
   - Cycle 7: 27-2-1-14-6-28-19-5-26-15-17-23-27
   - Cycle 8: 27-2-1-14-16-3-2
   - Cycle 9: 27-2-4-6-28-19-29-20-27
   - Cycle 10: 27-2-4-22-25-17-23-27
   - Cycle 11: 27-20-29-19-28-6-14-1-2-27
   - Cycle 12: 27-29-28-19-5-26-8-7-12-21-24-27

Step 2:  
- The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
   - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <27, (28, 19), 29, 6>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <27, (20, 29), 19, 28>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <27, (23, 17), 15, 26>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <27, (0, 23), 17, 15> (This cycle has an extra chord that doesn't satisfy the condition)

Step 3:  
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
