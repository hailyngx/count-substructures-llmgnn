- Cycle 5: (3, 13, 0, 14)
- Cycle 6: (10, 9, 7, 14)
- Cycle 7: (10, 14, 1, 3)
- Cycle 8: (11, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 9: (11, 12, 5, 2)
- Cycle 10: (0, 13, 3, 7)
- Cycle 11: (0, 14, 1, 6)
- Cycle 12: (2, 5, 12, 11)
- Cycle 13: (5, 8, 7, 3)
- Cycle 14: (5, 12, 9, 10)
- Cycle 15: (5, 7, 3, 1)

- Cycle 17: (5, 2, 11, 10)
- Cycle 18: (4, 13, 3, 1)
- Cycle 19: (6, 0, 14, 1)
- Cycle 20: (6, 14, 7, 3)
- Cycle 21: (12, 1, 4, 13)
- Cycle 22: (12, 5, 8, 7)
- Cycle 23: (12, 9, 11, 3)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <1, 3, 7, 14>
  Chord: (1, 7)
- <1, 4, 13, 0>
  Chord: (1, 13)
- <1, 12, 5, 0>
  Chord: (1, 5)
- <3, 11, 10, 6>
  Chord: (3, 10)
- <3, 13, 0, 14>
  Chord: (3, 0)
- <10, 9, 7, 14>
  Chord: (10, 7)
- <10, 14, 1, 3>
  Chord: (10, 1)
- <11, 9, 7, 3>
  Chord: (11, 7)
- <11, 12, 5, 2>
  Chord: (11, 5)
- <0, 13, 3, 7>
  Chord: (0, 3)
- <0, 14, 1, 6>
  Chord: (0, 1)
- <2, 5, 12, 11>
  Chord: (2, 12)
- <5, 8, 7, 3>
  Chord: (5, 7)
- <5, 12, 9, 10>
  Chord: (5, 9)
- <5, 7, 3, 1>
  Chord: (5, 3)
- <5, 4, 13, 0>
  Chord: (5, 13)
- <5, 2, 11, 10>
  Chord: (5, 11)
- <4, 13, 3, 1>
  Chord: (4, 3)
- <6, 0, 14, 1>
  Chord: (6, 14)
- <6, 14, 7, 3>
  Chord: (6, 7)
- <12, 1, 4, 13>
  Chord: (12, 4)
- <12, 5, 8, 7>
  Chord: (12, 8)
- <12, 9, 11, 3>
  Chord: (12, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 23 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. Hence, the count is [23].
