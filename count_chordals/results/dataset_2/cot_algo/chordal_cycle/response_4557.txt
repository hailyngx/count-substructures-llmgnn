Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 17) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 15) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 12) (6, 9) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (5, 10) (5, 14) (18, 15) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 19) (17, 11) (17, 9) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 15) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 19) (0, 1) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-4-19-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-4-19-16-18-15-6-9-17-11-12-10-5-14-1

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 19)
- Cycle 2 has four chords: (1, 16), (4, 18), (6, 17), (9, 11)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have [2].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<1, (1, 19)>
<2, (1, 16), (4, 18), (6, 17), (9, 11)>
