Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (17, 7) (17, 19) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (19, 17) (19, 18) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 15) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (11, 18) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 6) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 6) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (6, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-1-12-4-6-3
- Cycle 2: 12-4-16-2-1-12
- Cycle 3: 13-0-8-9-2-13
- Cycle 4: 14-3-12-1-2-14
- Cycle 5: 16-6-4-12-3-16
  
Step 2:
Identify the unique chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal cycle 1: <3, (1, 12), 4, 6>
- Chordal cycle 2: <12, (4, 16), 2, 1>
- Chordal cycle 3: <13, (0, 8), 9, 2>
- Chordal cycle 4: <14, (3, 12), 1, 2>
- Chordal cycle 5: <16, (6, 4), 12, 3>

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is [5].
