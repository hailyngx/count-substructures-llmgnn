Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (5, 19) (5, 16) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 6) (8, 17) (8, 6) (0, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 9) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 12) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 1) (3, 4) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 18) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 12) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 15) (18, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

Cycles:
- <14, 17, 16, 5, 19>
- <4, 7, 0, 1, 11>
- <4, 7, 0, 1, 12>
- <4, 12, 1, 11, 2>
- <4, 12, 1, 18, 10>
- <4, 2, 11, 1, 12>
- <4, 2, 6, 8, 17>
- <4, 15, 10, 18, 1>
- <7, 4, 2, 6, 8>
- <10, 15, 4, 2, 6>
- <10, 15, 12, 1, 11>
- <11, 14, 9, 13, 16>
- <14, 9, 10, 15, 12>
- <14, 19, 9, 13, 16>
- <17, 16, 5, 19, 9>
- <18, 10, 15, 12, 1>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, 7, 0, (1), 11>
- <4, 7, 0, (1), 12>
- <4, 12, (1), 11, 2>
- <4, 2, 11, (1), 12>
- <4, 15, 10, (18), 1>
- <7, 4, 2, (6), 8>
- <10, 15, 4, 2, (6)>
- <10, 15, 12, 1, (11)>
- <11, 14, 9, (13), 16>
- <17, 16, 5, 19, (9)>
- <18, 10, 15, 12, (1)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the answer is [11].
