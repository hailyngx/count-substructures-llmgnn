Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) 

Response:
Step 1:  
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 13, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 11, 2, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 10, 13, 1, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 0, 3, 14, 7)
- Cycle 5: (0, 5, 2, 11, 0)
- Cycle 6: (10, 3, 0, 14, 10)
- Cycle 7: (8, 9, 13, 3, 8)
- Cycle 8: (12, 11, 2, 8, 12)

Step 2:  
- Checking for chords in the cycles:
    - <1, (9, 13), 6>
    - <2, (7, 11), 4>
    - <3, (10, 13), 1>
    - <4, (0, 14), 7>
    - <5, (0, 2), 3>
    - <6, (0, 14), 10>
    - <7, (8, 13), 3>
    - <8, (2, 8), 14>

Step 3:  
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
