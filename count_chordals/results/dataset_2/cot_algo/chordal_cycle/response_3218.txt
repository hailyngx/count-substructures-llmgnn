Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 6 - 9 - 14 - 1 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 6 - 9 - 14 - 1 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 6 - 9 - 14 - 12 - 11 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 2 - 14 - 12 - 11 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 5: 1 - 2 - 14 - 12 - 11 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 2 - 14 - 12 - 11 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 5 - 11 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 8: 1 - 5 - 13 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 9: 1 - 7 - 11 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 10: 1 - 7 - 11 - 12 - 14 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 11: 1 - 7 - 11 - 12 - 14 - 2 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 12: 1 - 1 (self-loop)
- Cycle 13: 1 - 1 (self-loop)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Upon checking the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <1, 2, 5, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles found is [12].
