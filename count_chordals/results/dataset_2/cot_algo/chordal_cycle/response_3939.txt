Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 10) (26, 20) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 7) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 2) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 24) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (22, 23) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 16) (12, 27) (12, 29) (6, 5) (6, 11) (19, 15) (19, 21) (19, 20) (21, 19) (21, 29) (28, 7) (28, 25) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 20) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 18) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 25) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 21) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 23) (24, 27) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 4) (20, 26) (20, 19) (20, 10) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 28) (4, 13) (4, 24) (4, 16) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 2) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 18) (25, 2) (2, 27) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle <5, 6, 11, 14>  
2. Cycle <5, 18, 25, 23>  
3. Cycle <5, 18, 25, 28>  
4. Cycle <5, 18, 14, 11>  
5. Cycle <8, 5, 18, 25>  
6. Cycle <8, 5, 18, 14>  
7. Cycle <8, 16, 2, 27>  
8. Cycle <8, 16, 2, 25>  
9. Cycle <8, 16, 4, 24>  
10. Cycle <8, 13, 4, 24>  
11. Cycle <13, 8, 5, 18>  
12. Cycle <13, 8, 16, 4>  
13. Cycle <13, 7, 15, 19>  
14. Cycle <13, 7, 28, 25>  
15. Cycle <7, 15, 19, 21> 
16. Cycle <7, 28, 25, 23>
17. Cycle <7, 13, 8, 5>
18. Cycle <7, 28, 25, 18>
19. Cycle <19, 15, 27, 2> 
20. Cycle <19, 15, 27, 24>
21. Cycle <19, 21, 29, 12> 
22. Cycle <17, 3, 1, 8> 
23. Cycle <17, 23, 25, 18> 
24. Cycle <17, 23, 22, 0> 
25. Cycle <17, 9, 18, 14> 
26. Cycle <29, 1, 8, 5> 
27. Cycle <29, 12, 27, 15> 
28. Cycle <29, 12, 27, 2> 
29. Cycle <29, 21, 19, 15> 
30. Cycle <29, 21, 19, 20> 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 6, 11, 14> has two chords: (6, 11) and (5, 14)
- <5, 18, 25, 23> has one chord: (18, 23)
- <5, 18, 25, 28> has one chord: (18, 28)
- <5, 18, 14, 11> has one chord: (5, 14)
- <8, 5, 18, 25> has one chord: (8, 25)
- <8, 5, 18, 14> has one chord: (5, 14)
- <13, 8, 5, 18> has one chord: (13, 18)
- <13, 8, 16, 4> has one chord: (8, 4)
- <13, 7, 15, 19> has one chord: (7, 19)
- <13, 7, 28, 25> has one chord: (7, 28)
- <19, 15, 27, 2> has one chord: (15, 2)
- <19, 15, 27, 24> has one chord: (15, 24)
- <17, 23, 22, 0> has one chord: (23, 0)
- <29, 21, 19, 15> has one chord: (21, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [24]
