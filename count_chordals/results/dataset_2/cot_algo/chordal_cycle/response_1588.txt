Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 18) (6, 17) (9, 10) (9, 27) (0, 27) (0, 1) (0, 19) (27, 9) (27, 0) (27, 20) (27, 8) (10, 17) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 24) (4, 5) (18, 17) (18, 25) (18, 29) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 15) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 21) (26, 7) (3, 11) (3, 24) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 29) (7, 10) (7, 26) (7, 1) (25, 18) (25, 5) (25, 19) (16, 2) (16, 15) (28, 5) (2, 22) (2, 16) (2, 1) (2, 20) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 20) (1, 5) (20, 27) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 1) (24, 10) (24, 3) (24, 13) (24, 5) (24, 23) (8, 27) (8, 29) (19, 0) (19, 25) (19, 29) (29, 18) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 19) (23, 24) (5, 4) (5, 25) (5, 28) (5, 1) (5, 24) (13, 24) (13, 15) (12, 17) (12, 21) (21, 26) (21, 12) (21, 15) (15, 22) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 13) (15, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (17, 10, 9, 27)  
- Cycle 2: (17, 10, 24, 3)  
- Cycle 3: (17, 10, 7, 1)  
- Cycle 4: (17, 10, 7, 26)  
- Cycle 5: (17, 18, 25, 5)  
- Cycle 6: (17, 18, 29, 11)  
- Cycle 7: (17, 18, 29, 19)  
- Cycle 8: (17, 6, 17, 10)  
- Cycle 9: (17, 6, 17, 12)  
- Cycle 10: (17, 12, 21, 26)  
- Cycle 11: (17, 12, 21, 15)  
- Cycle 12: (10, 9, 27, 0)  
- Cycle 13: (10, 9, 27, 20)  
- Cycle 14: (10, 9, 27, 8)  
- Cycle 15: (9, 27, 0, 1)  
- Cycle 16: (9, 27, 0, 19)  
- Cycle 17: (27, 20, 26, 22)  
- Cycle 18: (27, 20, 26, 7)  
- Cycle 19: (27, 0, 1, 7)  
- Cycle 20: (27, 0, 1, 20)  
- Cycle 21: (0, 27, 9, 10)  
- Cycle 22: (0, 27, 9, 17)  
- Cycle 23: (0, 19, 25, 18)  
- Cycle 24: (0, 19, 25, 5)  
- Cycle 25: (0, 19, 29, 18)  
- Cycle 26: (19, 25, 18, 17)  
- Cycle 27: (19, 25, 5, 4)  
- Cycle 28: (19, 25, 5, 1)  
- Cycle 29: (19, 29, 18, 17)  
- Cycle 30: (19, 29, 18, 25)  
- ... (additional cycles exist)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <17, (10, 9), 27>  
- <17, (10, 24), 3>  
- <17, (10, 7), 1>  
- <17, (10, 7), 26>  
- ... (cycles with chords exist)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of [4] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
