Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (6, 4) (6, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5 - 1 - 14 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 7 - 4 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 14 - 3 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 0 - 4 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 7 - 4 - 0 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 12 - 10 - 13 - 9
- Cycle 7: 4 - 7 - 8 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 8: 4 - 0 - 10 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 9: 4 - 8 - 2 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 10: 7 - 5 - 9 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 11: 7 - 11 - 0 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 12: 1 - 3 - 13 - 10 - 1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (0, 9)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (0, 7)
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (8, 1)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (4, 10)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (5, 4)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (0, 7)
- Cycle 12 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (4, 7), 14)>
<1, (1, 3), 14)>
<4, (0, 9), 7)>
<4, (4, 10), 8)>
<7, (5, 4), 9)>
