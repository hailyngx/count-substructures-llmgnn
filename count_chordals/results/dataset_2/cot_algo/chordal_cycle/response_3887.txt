Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 6) (7, 21) (7, 26) (7, 5) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 25) (12, 21) (27, 14) (27, 9) (27, 13) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 22) (6, 16) (24, 22) (24, 2) (26, 7) (26, 8) (26, 4) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 20) (17, 25) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 10) (10, 20) (10, 9) (15, 9) (2, 16) (2, 24) (2, 22) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 24) (22, 2) (22, 0) (25, 21) (25, 17) (25, 29) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 23) (3, 0) (3, 23) (3, 29) (3, 18) (1, 28) (1, 4) (14, 27) (14, 19) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 15) (9, 23) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 28) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 29) (4, 26) (4, 20) (4, 1) (4, 13) (13, 27) (13, 4) (13, 29) (29, 25) (29, 3) (29, 8) (29, 13) (28, 1) (28, 18) (23, 0) (23, 3) (23, 9) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle: <9, 11, 16, 2, 9>
2. Cycle: <9, 11, 17, 7, 9>
3. Cycle: <9, 11, 16, 6, 9>
4. Cycle: <9, 15, 9, 11, 16, 6, 9>
5. Cycle: <9, 23, 3, 29, 13, 27, 9>
6. Cycle: <9, 23, 0, 22, 2, 16, 6, 9>
7. Cycle: <9, 23, 3, 0, 22, 2, 16, 6, 9>
8. Cycle: <9, 27, 13, 4, 26, 7, 17, 11, 9>
9. Cycle: <9, 27, 14, 19, 16, 2, 22, 5, 7, 17, 11, 9>
10. Cycle: <11, 17, 7, 21, 12, 9, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle <9, 11, 16, 2, 9> has 1 chord: (11, 16)
- Cycle <9, 11, 17, 7, 9> has 1 chord: (11, 17)
- Cycle <9, 11, 16, 6, 9> has 1 chord: (11, 16)
- Cycle <9, 15, 9, 11, 16, 6, 9> has 1 chord: (9, 11)
- Cycle <9, 23, 3, 29, 13, 27, 9> has 1 chord: (9, 27)
- Cycle <9, 23, 0, 22, 2, 16, 6, 9> has 1 chord: (9, 22)
- Cycle <9, 23, 3, 0, 22, 2, 16, 6, 9> has 1 chord: (9, 22)
- Cycle <9, 27, 13, 4, 26, 7, 17, 11, 9> has 1 chord: (9, 11)
- Cycle <9, 27, 14, 19, 16, 2, 22, 5, 7, 17, 11, 9> has 1 chord: (9, 11)
- Cycle <11, 17, 7, 21, 12, 9, 11> has 1 chord: (7, 21)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <<9, 11, 17, 7, 9>>
