Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 12, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 5, 1, 8, 14, 12, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 3, 0, 5, 1, 13, 6, 10, 7, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 12, 14, 8, 1, 5, 0, 3, 2, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 11, 0, 3, 2, 14, 10, 6, 13, 7)
- Cycle 6: (12, 14, 8, 1, 5, 4, 3, 0, 11, 12)
- Cycle 7: (5, 1, 13, 10, 7, 4, 12, 0, 3, 5)
- Cycle 8: (13, 6, 10, 14, 2, 3, 0, 5, 1, 13)
- Cycle 9: (3, 0, 12, 14, 2, 7, 10, 6, 1, 3)
- Cycle 10: (11, 0, 3, 2, 14, 12, 4, 5, 1, 11)
- Cycle 11: (1, 8, 14, 12, 4, 7, 10, 13, 6, 1)
- Cycle 12: (6, 13, 10, 7, 4, 5, 1, 8, 14, 6)
- Cycle 13: (0, 3, 5, 4, 7, 10, 14, 12, 0)
- Cycle 14: (2, 7, 10, 14, 8, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2)
- Cycle 15: (14, 9, 13, 6, 10, 7, 2, 3, 0, 14)
- Cycle 16: (9, 2, 7, 10, 14, 12, 4, 5, 1, 9)
- Cycle 17: (10, 13, 1, 5, 4, 7, 11, 0, 3, 10)
- Cycle 18: (8, 14, 12, 4, 5, 0, 3, 2, 9, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <4, (12, 7), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (5, 1), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (3, 0), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, (12, 14), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <7, (11, 0), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <12, (14, 8), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, (1, 13), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <13, (6, 10), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <3, (0, 12), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <11, (0, 3), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <1, (8, 14), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <6, (13, 10), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <0, (3, 5), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <2, (7, 10), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <14, (9, 13), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <9, (2, 7), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <10, (13, 1), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <8, (14, 12), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

Therefore, the total number of unique chordal 4-cycles is [18].
