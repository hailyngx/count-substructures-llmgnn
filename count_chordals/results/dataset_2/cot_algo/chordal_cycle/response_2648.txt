Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 2) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 14) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 16) (18, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 19) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 6) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 19) (1, 16) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 5) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 14) (9, 8) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 13) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 2, 17, 10)
- Cycle 2: (11, 16, 2, 17, 0)
- Cycle 3: (11, 16, 18, 4, 19)
- Cycle 4: (11, 16, 18, 4, 6)
- Cycle 5: (11, 16, 18, 4, 14)
- Cycle 6: (11, 16, 1, 15, 6)
- Cycle 7: (11, 16, 1, 15, 14)
- Cycle 8: (11, 16, 1, 7, 0)
- Cycle 9: (11, 16, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 10: (11, 16, 1, 5, 12)
- Cycle 11: (11, 16, 1, 5, 19)
- Cycle 12: (11, 16, 1, 5, 0)
- Cycle 13: (11, 16, 1, 7, 0)
- Cycle 14: (11, 16, 1, 7, 1)
- Cycle 15: (11, 16, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 16: (11, 8, 5, 12, 19)
- Cycle 17: (11, 8, 5, 1, 16)
- Cycle 18: (11, 8, 5, 1, 15)
- Cycle 19: (11, 8, 5, 1, 7)
- Cycle 20: (11, 8, 5, 5, 0)
- Cycle 21: (11, 8, 5, 5, 19)
- Cycle 22: (11, 8, 5, 0, 14)
- Cycle 23: (11, 8, 5, 19, 4)
- Cycle 24: (11, 8, 5, 19, 14)
- Cycle 25: (11, 8, 5, 19, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (16, 2), 17, 10> (Chord: (16, 2))
- <2, (17, 0), 11, 16> (Chord: (17, 0))
- <4, (18, 4), 19, 6> (Chord: (18, 4))
- <4, (18, 4), 14, 0> (Chord: (18, 4))
- <14, (1, 15), 6, 11> (Chord: (1, 15))
- <14, (1, 15), 7, 16> (Chord: (1, 15))
- <5, (19, 12), 8, 11> (Chord: (19, 12))
- <5, (19, 12), 1, 16> (Chord: (19, 12))
- <5, (19, 4), 8, 11> (Chord: (19, 4))
- <5, (19, 4), 16, 1> (Chord: (19, 4))
- <5, (19, 14), 12, 11> (Chord: (19, 14))
- <5, (19, 14), 0, 16> (Chord: (19, 14))
- <5, (19, 6), 14, 4> (Chord: (19, 6))
- <5, (19, 6), 0, 16> (Chord: (19, 6))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
