Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-1-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-2-5-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-9-6-4-0
- Cycle 4: 0-5-7-9-0
- Cycle 5: 2-3-1-4-2
- Cycle 6: 2-0-5-4-2
- Cycle 7: 2-8-4-1-2
- Cycle 8: 3-1-7-5-3
- Cycle 9: 3-0-9-6-3

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (5, 2).
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has a chord (9, 7).
- Cycle 5 has a chord (3, 1).
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has a chord (4, 1).
- Cycle 8 has a chord (7, 5).
- Cycle 9 has no chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Only <2, (5, 2)> <4, (9, 7)> <8, (7, 5)> cycles are chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles is [3].
