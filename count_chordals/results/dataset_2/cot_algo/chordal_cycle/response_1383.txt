Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 17) (5, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 17) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 17) (14, 15) (14, 12) (14, 16) (18, 6) (18, 11) (18, 12) (19, 9) (19, 11) (1, 6) (1, 13) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 8) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 8) (8, 16) (8, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (3, 6, 5, 6)
- Cycle 2: (3, 6, 1, 13)
- Cycle 3: (3, 12, 14, 15)
- Cycle 4: (3, 12, 16, 14)
- Cycle 5: (15, 14, 16, 12)
- Cycle 6: (15, 14, 12, 3)
- Cycle 7: (15, 12, 3, 6)
- Cycle 8: (15, 12, 18, 6)
- Cycle 9: (4, 7, 0, 17)
- Cycle 10: (4, 7, 17, 10)
- Cycle 11: (4, 7, 15, 14)
- Cycle 12: (4, 9, 2, 13)
- Cycle 13: (4, 9, 19, 11)
- Cycle 14: (4, 13, 6, 5)
- Cycle 15: (17, 10, 0, 7)
- Cycle 16: (17, 0, 7, 4)
- Cycle 17: (17, 0, 7, 15)
- Cycle 18: (6, 3, 12, 14)
- Cycle 19: (6, 3, 15, 14)
- Cycle 20: (6, 5, 6, 1)
- Cycle 21: (6, 5, 6, 13)
- Cycle 22: (6, 13, 2, 9)
- Cycle 23: (6, 13, 1, 6)
- Cycle 24: (7, 0, 17, 10)
- Cycle 25: (7, 4, 9, 2)
- Cycle 26: (15, 14, 12, 18)
- Cycle 27: (15, 14, 16, 12)
- Cycle 28: (12, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 29: (12, 3, 15, 14)
- Cycle 30: (12, 18, 11, 19)
- Cycle 31: (16, 12, 18, 11)
- Cycle 32: (16, 12, 14, 15)

Step 2:
Identifying the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2: (3, 6, 1, 13) <(3, 13)>
- Cycle 4: (3, 12, 16, 14) <(12, 16)>
- Cycle 7: (15, 12, 3, 6) <(12, 6)>
- Cycle 8: (15, 12, 18, 6) <(12, 18)>
- Cycle 11: (4, 7, 15, 14) <(7, 15)>
- Cycle 26: (15, 14, 12, 18) <(14, 12)>
- Cycle 28: (12, 3, 6, 5) <(3, 6)>
- Cycle 30: (12, 18, 11, 19) <(18, 11)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is the number of cycles with exactly one chord:
- There are 7 chordal 4-cycles in total, so the answer is [7].
