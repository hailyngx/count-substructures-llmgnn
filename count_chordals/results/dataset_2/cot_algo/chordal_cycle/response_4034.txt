Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 1) (15, 4) (2, 13) (2, 9) (12, 10) (12, 19) (14, 6) (14, 8) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (19, 7) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 12) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (11, 16, 6, 17, 11)
2. (16, 18, 7, 19, 16)
3. (16, 6, 14, 8, 16)
4. (16, 9, 2, 13, 16)
5. (5, 1, 15, 4, 5)
6. (5, 13, 3, 4, 5)
7. (0, 7, 8, 3, 0)
8. (0, 18, 7, 19, 0)
9. (1, 10, 12, 19, 1)
10. (1, 9, 4, 15, 1)
11. (13, 2, 9, 4, 13)
12. (13, 5, 1, 10, 13)
13. (7, 18, 0, 4, 7)
14. (7, 19, 12, 10, 7)
15. (7, 8, 14, 6, 7)
16. (15, 1, 9, 2, 15)
17. (15, 4, 3, 8, 15)
18. (2, 9, 4, 3, 2)
19. (12, 10, 1, 5, 12)
20. (12, 19, 7, 18, 12)
21. (14, 6, 16, 11, 14)
22. (14, 8, 17, 6, 14)
23. (6, 17, 11, 16, 6)
24. (17, 8, 14, 6, 17)
25. (17, 11, 16, 18, 17)
26. (3, 4, 0, 18, 3)
27. (3, 8, 17, 11, 3)
28. (8, 17, 6, 14, 8)
29. (8, 3, 13, 5, 8)
30. (4, 9, 16, 18, 4)
31. (4, 3, 8, 17, 4)
32. (9, 16, 11, 17, 9)
33. (9, 4, 0, 18, 9)
34. (19, 7, 0, 18, 19)
35. (19, 12, 10, 5, 19)
36. (10, 5, 13, 2, 10)
37. (10, 12, 19, 7, 10)
38. (18, 16, 6, 14, 18)
39. (18, 0, 7, 19, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycle found is:
- Chordless cycle <1, (15, 4), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
