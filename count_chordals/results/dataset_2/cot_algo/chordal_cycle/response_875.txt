Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (3, 11) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 11) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 17) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 16) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 19) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (19, 4) (19, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: 6-5-9-10-6
- Cycle 2: 6-5-9-16-6
- Cycle 3: 15-0-14-12-15
- Cycle 4: 1-6-5-9-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-2-14-1
- Cycle 6: 1-6-4-12-1
- Cycle 7: 6-4-12-14-6
- Cycle 8: 6-4-2-12-6
- Cycle 9: 15-0-14-17-15
- Cycle 10: 4-6-5-9-4
- Cycle 11: 4-6-2-12-4
- Cycle 12: 14-0-7-1-14
- Cycle 13: 14-0-15-11-14
- Cycle 14: 14-0-15-13-14
- Cycle 15: 4-18-16-9-4
- Cycle 16: 4-18-11-3-4
- Cycle 17: 12-2-4-6-12
- Cycle 18: 1-17-13-8-1
- Cycle 19: 1-17-14-0-1
- Cycle 20: 1-17-14-12-1

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord (one edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (5, 10), 9, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (5, 16), 9, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (14, 12), 15, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (2, 12), 6, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [4].
