Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 8) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 15) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 13) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 6) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 0) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (5, 18) (5, 19) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (19, 5) (19, 1) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 8) (12, 16) (12, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 15) (3, 16) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 9) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 15) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (11, 1, 13, 14, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 8, 16, 12, 11)
- Cycle 3: (16, 3, 17, 4, 16)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 6, 2, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 17, 10, 13, 4)
- Cycle 6: (7, 15, 9, 14, 7)
- Cycle 7: (10, 13, 14, 9, 10)
- Cycle 8: (17, 3, 9, 15, 17)
- Cycle 9: (18, 0, 14, 11, 18)
- Cycle 10: (18, 6, 7, 15, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- From the cycles above, only Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (13, 14).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There is one unique chordal 4-cycle found, which is <13, (13, 14), 11>.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
