Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 20, (7, 4), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, 25, (21, 27), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <8, 14, (0, 13), 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, 11, (27, 21), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <18, 28, (7, 25), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <19, 1, (10, 27), 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <15, 23, (5, 21), 27>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <16, 19, (10, 3), 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <24, 14, (4, 12), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <12, 8, (14, 18), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <11, 9, (13, 21), 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since we found 11 unique chordal 4-cycles, the number of chordless cycles is [63].
