Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 16) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 19) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (6, 17) (6, 7) (9, 18) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 16) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 16) (13, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (19, 1) (19, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 15) (12, 8) (12, 4) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 13) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (15, 17) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 3, 11, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 7, 2, 4, 12, 0)
- Cycle 3: (13, 14, 17, 18, 16, 13)
- Cycle 4: (13, 15, 17, 18, 16, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

For Cycle 1, (0, 5) is a chord.
For Cycle 2, (0, 1) is a chord.
For Cycle 3, (14, 16) is a chord.
For Cycle 4, (15, 17) is a chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles found is [0].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <1, (0, 5), 3, 11)>
- <2, (7, 5), 4, 12)>
- <3, (14, 16), 18, 13)>
- <4, (15, 17), 18, 13)>
