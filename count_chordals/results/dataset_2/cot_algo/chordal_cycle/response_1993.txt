Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (16, 27) (16, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (27, 16) (27, 29) (27, 26) (18, 0) (18, 14) (18, 28) (22, 26) (22, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 8) (13, 20) (13, 24) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 21) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (20, 13) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 2) (25, 20) (7, 22) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 19) (21, 14) (21, 3) (21, 9) (21, 5) (28, 18) (28, 4) (28, 2) (26, 27) (26, 22) (26, 7) (26, 5) (24, 13) (24, 9) (3, 21) (3, 6) (3, 19) (29, 27) (29, 20) (29, 15) (4, 0) (4, 28) (4, 23) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 26) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 29) (9, 10) (9, 21) (9, 24) (9, 1) (9, 19) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 19) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 4) (2, 23) (23, 14) (23, 4) (23, 2) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, along with the edges forming each cycle, are as follows:
1. Cycle: <0, 4, 23, 14> with edges (0, 4), (4, 23), (23, 14), (14, 0)
2. Cycle: <0, 4, 28, 18> with edges (0, 4), (4, 28), (28, 18), (18, 0)
3. Cycle: <0, 18, 14, 23> with edges (0, 18), (18, 14), (14, 23), (23, 0)
4. Cycle: <4, 28, 2, 23> with edges (4, 28), (28, 2), (2, 23), (23, 4)
5. Cycle: <7, 26, 5, 17> with edges (7, 26), (26, 5), (5, 17), (17, 7)
6. Cycle: <13, 8, 5, 17> with edges (13, 8), (8, 5), (5, 17), (17, 13)
7. Cycle: <13, 8, 5, 26> with edges (13, 8), (8, 5), (5, 26), (26, 13)
8. Cycle: <13, 20, 2, 28> with edges (13, 20), (20, 2), (2, 28), (28, 13)
9. Cycle: <13, 20, 29, 27> with edges (13, 20), (20, 29), (29, 27), (27, 13)
10. Cycle: <14, 18, 28, 4> with edges (14, 18), (18, 28), (28, 4), (4, 14)
11. Cycle: <14, 18, 0, 4> with edges (14, 18), (18, 0), (0, 4), (4, 14)
12. Cycle: <15, 16, 27, 29> with edges (15, 16), (16, 27), (27, 29), (29, 15)
13. Cycle: <26, 27, 16, 15> with edges (26, 27), (27, 16), (16, 15), (15, 26)

Step 2:
The cycles from the list above with exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes) are:
1. <13, (20, 2), 28>
2. <13, (8, 5), 26>

Step 3:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
