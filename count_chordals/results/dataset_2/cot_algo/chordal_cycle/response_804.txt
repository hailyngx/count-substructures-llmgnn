Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 19) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 0) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 17) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 1) (11, 2) (11, 18) (14, 2) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 19) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 13, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 13, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (6, 7, 12, 15, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 2, 3, 4, 6)
- Cycle 5: (7, 12, 15, 1, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 10, 9, 0, 7)
- Cycle 7: (12, 15, 0, 4, 12)
- Cycle 8: (2, 3, 4, 9, 2)
- Cycle 9: (8, 17, 19, 4, 8)
- Cycle 10: (13, 3, 4, 9, 13)
- Cycle 11: (1, 9, 0, 4, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 16, 15, 12, 1)
- Cycle 13: (15, 0, 18, 11, 15)
- Cycle 14: (19, 8, 17, 5, 19)
- Cycle 15: (0, 15, 12, 9, 0)
- Cycle 16: (16, 1, 9, 0, 16)
- Cycle 17: (11, 18, 0, 9, 11)
- Cycle 18: (14, 2, 6, 13, 14)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <5, (13, 6), 2, 5>: Chord = (13, 6)
- <5, 13, (3, 4), 5>: Chord = (3, 4)
- <6, 7, 12, (15, 1), 6>: Chord = (15, 1)
- <6, (2, 3), 4, 6>: Chord = (2, 3)
- <7, 12, (15, 1), 7>: Chord = (15, 1)
- <7, (10, 9), 0, 7>: Chord = (10, 9)
- <12, 15, (0, 4), 12>: Chord = (0, 4)
- <2, (3, 4), 9, 2>: Chord = (3, 4)
- <8, 17, 19, (4, 8)>: Chord = (4, 8)
- <13, (3, 4), 9, 13>: Chord = (3, 4)
- <1, 9, (0, 4), 1>: Chord = (0, 4)
- <1, (16, 15), 12, 1>: Chord = (16, 15)
- <15, 0, (18, 11), 15>: Chord = (18, 11)
- <19, 8, 17, (5, 19)>: Chord = (5, 19)
- <0, 15, 12, (9, 0)>: Chord = (9, 0)
- <16, 1, 9, (0, 16)>: Chord = (0, 16)
- <11, 18, 0, (9, 11)>: Chord = (9, 11)
- <14, 2, 6, (13, 14)>: Chord = (13, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
There are 17 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [17].
