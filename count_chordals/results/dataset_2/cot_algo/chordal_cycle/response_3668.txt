Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 2) (13, 20) (13, 7) (22, 0) (22, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (21, 26) (21, 18) (21, 29) (2, 13) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 20) (29, 21) (29, 2) (29, 10) (6, 9) (6, 24) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 14) (18, 21) (18, 19) (18, 25) (0, 22) (0, 20) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 10) (15, 20) (15, 11) (15, 16) (28, 26) (28, 25) (26, 21) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 12) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (11, 15) (11, 3) (11, 27) (11, 5) (8, 9) (16, 15) (16, 25) (19, 2) (19, 18) (24, 6) (24, 9) (24, 17) (24, 25) (5, 26) (5, 11) (5, 7) (23, 17) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 27) (7, 17) (17, 24) (17, 23) (17, 7) (4, 1) (4, 14) (10, 1) (10, 29) (10, 20) (10, 3) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 25) (27, 11) (27, 7) (12, 1) (12, 26) (25, 18) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 24) (25, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle <1, 10, 29, 21, 26> with edges (1, 10), (10, 29), (29, 21), (21, 26), and (26, 1).
- Cycle <2, 13, 20, 15, 11> with edges (2, 13), (13, 20), (20, 15), (15, 11), and (11, 2).
  
Step 2:
- Checking cycle <1, 10, 29, 21, 26> for a chord: 
  <1, (29, 26), 21, 10> - Chord: (29, 26)
  
Step 3:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph: [1]

The unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, (29, 26), 21, 10>
