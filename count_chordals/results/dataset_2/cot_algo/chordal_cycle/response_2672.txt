Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (0, 8, 1, 6, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 8, 6, 2, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 8, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 2, 6, 1, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 2, 7, 4, 0)
- Cycle 6: (1, 5, 9, 6, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 5, 0, 8, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 6, 9, 8, 1)
- Cycle 9: (2, 0, 8, 4, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 0, 5, 1, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 6, 9, 5, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 7, 4, 8, 2)
- Cycle 13: (3, 9, 5, 0, 3)
- Cycle 14: (3, 9, 6, 1, 3)
- Cycle 15: (3, 6, 9, 5, 3)
- Cycle 16: (4, 0, 8, 6, 4)
- Cycle 17: (4, 0, 5, 9, 4)
- Cycle 18: (4, 7, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 19: (4, 8, 9, 5, 4)
- Cycle 20: (5, 1, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 21: (6, 1, 5, 9, 6)
- Cycle 22: (7, 4, 8, 9, 7)
- Cycle 23: (8, 0, 5, 9, 8)
- Cycle 24: (9, 5, 0, 4, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <0, 8, 1, 6, 0> has a chord (1, 6): <0, (1, 6), 8>
- <1, 5, 9, 6, 1> has a chord (5, 9): <1, (5, 9), 6>
- <1, 5, 0, 8, 1> has a chord (5, 8): <1, (5, 8), 0>
- <2, 0, 8, 4, 2> has a chord (0, 8): <2, (0, 8), 4>
- <3, 9, 6, 1, 3> has a chord (9, 1): <3, (9, 1), 6>
- <4, 7, 2, 6, 4> has a chord (7, 2): <4, (7, 2), 6>
- <5, 1, 6, 9, 5> has a chord (1, 9): <5, (1, 9), 6>
- <7, 4, 8, 9, 7> has a chord (4, 8): <7, (4, 8), 9>
- <8, 0, 5, 9, 8> has a chord (0, 5): <8, (0, 5), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
