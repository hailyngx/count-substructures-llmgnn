Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 11) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 16) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 19) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 14) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 6) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<3, 15, 12, 5>, <3, 15, 12, 4>, <3, 18, 4, 12>, <5, 9, 2, 8>, <5, 9, 17, 10>, <9, 2, 11, 19>, <9, 2, 1, 14>, <9, 17, 10, 8>, <9, 17, 8, 1>, <2, 8, 1, 14>, <2, 8, 1, 1> (duplicate), <2, 8, 10, 17>, <2, 1, 14, 19>, <8, 10, 17, 9>, <8, 10, 17, 9> (duplicate), <8, 17, 9, 2>, <8, 17, 10, 9>, <8, 1, 14, 2>, <4, 12, 14, 1>, <4, 12, 14, 19>, <18, 9, 17, 10>, <18, 9, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 9, 17>, <0, 5, 9, 2>, <0, 13, 3, 15>, <7, 0, 5, 9>, <12, 5, 9, 2>, <12, 5, 9, 17>, <12, 4, 18, 9>, <12, 4, 11, 19>, <1, 2, 8, 10>, <6, 3, 15, 12>, <11, 2, 8, 10>, <19, 3, 15, 12>, <14, 1, 2, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<3, 15, (6, 12), 5>, <3, 18, (4, 12), 5>, <5, 9, (2, 8), 17>, <2, 8, (1, 14), 9>, <2, 8, (10, 17), 9>, <2, 1, (14, 19), 9>, <8, 17, (10, 9), 2>, <4, 12, (14, 1), 18>, <18, 9, (17, 10), 2>, <0, 5, (9, 17), 13>, <0, 5, (9, 2), 13>, <0, 13, (3, 15), 7>, <7, 0, (5, 9), 13>, <12, 5, (9, 2), 4>, <12, 5, (9, 17), 4>, <12, 4, (18, 9), 11>, <1, 2, (8, 10), 14>, <6, 3, (15, 12), 16>, <11, 2, (8, 10), 19>, <19, 3, (15, 12), 11>, <14, 1, (2, 8), 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [3] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
