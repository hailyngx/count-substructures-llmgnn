Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 23) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 14) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 16) (15, 23) (15, 0) (15, 14) (0, 15) (0, 27) (0, 18) (27, 0) (27, 2) (27, 16) (1, 26) (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 20) (21, 5) (21, 22) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 24) (14, 26) (14, 15) (14, 23) (16, 3) (16, 27) (16, 18) (10, 6) (10, 29) (10, 5) (17, 28) (17, 25) (17, 12) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 11) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 22) (4, 2) (22, 21) (22, 25) (22, 4) (22, 5) (11, 25) (11, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 2) (29, 10) (29, 18) (20, 1) (20, 21) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 23) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 14) (23, 24) (19, 1) (2, 9) (2, 27) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (13, 9) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 24) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        <0, 15, 23, 24>
        <0, 15, 14, 26>
        <0, 27, 2, 9>
        <0, 27, 16, 3>
        <1, 26, 14, 15>
        <1, 26, 28, 3>
        <1, 26, 14, 23>
        <1, 26, 28, 17>
        <1, 21, 5, 22>
        <1, 21, 22, 25>
        <1, 21, 20, 1>
        <1, 21, 20, 19>
        <2, 9, 13, 9>
        <2, 9, 23, 15>
        <2, 4, 22, 5>
        <2, 4, 22, 25>
        <2, 4, 22, 21>
        <2, 4, 11, 25>
        <2, 11, 25, 17>
        <2, 11, 25, 22>
        <2, 11, 25, 4>
        <2, 11, 25, 22>
        <2, 11, 25, 4>
        <3, 28, 24, 23>
        <3, 28, 17, 25>
        <3, 28, 17, 12>
        <4, 22, 21, 1>
        <4, 22, 25, 17>
        <4, 22, 5, 21>
        <5, 21, 1, 26>
        <5, 21, 22, 25>
        <5, 21, 20, 1>
        <5, 21, 20, 19>
        [0]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

<0, 15, 14, 26>
