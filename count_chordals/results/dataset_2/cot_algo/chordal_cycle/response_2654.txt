Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 21) (15, 2) (27, 4) (27, 11) (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 21) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 10) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 10) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 6) (7, 6) (12, 14) (12, 23) (12, 16) (12, 1) (4, 27) (4, 19) (18, 5) (18, 8) (13, 26) (13, 21) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 11) (26, 8) (1, 15) (1, 12) (1, 29) (3, 21) (3, 16) (21, 15) (21, 17) (21, 13) (21, 3) (21, 24) (6, 23) (6, 0) (6, 7) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 3) (29, 22) (29, 0) (29, 1) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 11) (28, 0) (8, 20) (8, 22) (8, 18) (8, 26) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 11) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 9) (24, 21) (9, 17) (9, 25) (9, 19) (9, 11) (11, 27) (11, 26) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (10, 20) (10, 25)

<29, 22, 23, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

<1, (12, 14), 17>
<1, (12, 16), 17>
<2, (11, 26), 13>
<3, (16, 17), 21>
<4, (19, 9), 11>
<8, (18, 5), 23>
<10, (20, 8), 18>
<13, (26, 11), 27>
<14, (12, 1), 15>
<16, (3, 21), 15>
<17, (14, 12), 1>
<22, (23, 5), 18>
<25, (17, 21), 15>
<26, (2, 15), 1>
<27, (4, 19), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph, so the final answer is [14].
