Step 2: 
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (8, 29), 17, 5)>
- <3, (17, 6), 25, 7)>
- <4, (11, 14), 18, 8)>
- <6, (0, 15), 17, 21)>
- <16, (4, 24), 13, 7)>
- <23, (1, 25), 21, 7)>
- <27, (11, 18), 8, 9)>
- <29, (1, 25), 19, 7)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [30]
