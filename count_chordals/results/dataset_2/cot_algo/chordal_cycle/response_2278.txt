Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 11) (7, 16) (7, 6) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 15) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 9) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (16, 3) (16, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 18) (18, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 11) (12, 15) (15, 5) (15, 12) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 11, 14, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 13, 3, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 3, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 13, 4, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 16, 7, 3)
- Cycle 8: (6, 7, 16, 6)
- Cycle 9: (5, 0, 17, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 8, 19, 5)
- Cycle 11: (5, 15, 12, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 19, 9, 5)
- Cycle 13: (8, 5, 0, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 10, 2, 8)
- Cycle 15: (8, 11, 1, 8)
- Cycle 16: (8, 19, 17, 8)
- Cycle 17: (9, 1, 13, 9)
- Cycle 18: (9, 19, 18, 9)
- Cycle 19: (10, 0, 5, 10)
- Cycle 20: (10, 8, 11, 10)
- Cycle 21: (10, 2, 3, 10)
- ...

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (1, 6), 3>
- <1, (1, 11), 14>
- <1, (1, 13), 3>
- <1, (3, 6), 1>
- <3, (6, 7), 3>
- ...

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are a total of [16] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
