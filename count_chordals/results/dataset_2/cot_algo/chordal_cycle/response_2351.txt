  - (14, 13, 12, 14)
  - (2, 1, 0, 2)
  - (2, 1, 11, 2)
  - (2, 10, 0, 2)

  - (11, 5, 7, 11)
  - (11, 0, 10, 11)
  - (11, 0, 1, 11)
  - (11, 6, 4, 11)
  - (4, 14, 13, 4)
  - (4, 3, 0, 4)
  - (4, 3, 6, 4)
  - (12, 9, 10, 12)
  - (12, 9, 7, 12)
  - (12, 8, 0, 12)
  - (10, 5, 13, 10)
  - (10, 5, 11, 10)
  - (10, 0, 8, 10)
  - (10, 0, 2, 10)

Step 2:
- Unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
  - <5, 10, (9, 13), 7>
  - <0, 11, (3, 6), 1>
  - <9, 13, (14, 12), 5>
  - <8, 0, (6, 14), 12>
  - <3, 0, (10, 11), 4>
  - <11, 0, (1, 6), 5>
  - <14, 4, (3, 6), 13>
  - <2, 10, (7, 0), 2>
  - <13, 5, (9, 11), 14>
  - <6, 8, (0, 12), 6>
  - <7, 5, (9, 13), 14>

Step 3:
- Count of chordal 4-cycles: [11]
