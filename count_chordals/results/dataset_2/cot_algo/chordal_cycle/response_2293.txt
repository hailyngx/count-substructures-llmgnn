Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-4-5
- Cycle 2: 9-6-4-7-9
- Cycle 3: 6-4-7-0-6
- Cycle 4: 4-7-0-2-4
- Cycle 5: 7-0-2-5-7
- Cycle 6: 0-2-5-1-0
- Cycle 7: 2-5-1-4-2
- Cycle 8: 5-1-4-7-5
- Cycle 9: 1-4-7-9-1
- Cycle 10: 3-6-4-7-3
- Cycle 11: 6-8-9-7-6
- Cycle 12: 8-9-7-0-8
- Cycle 13: 9-8-6-3-9
- Cycle 14: 8-6-3-2-8
- Cycle 15: 6-3-2-0-6
- Cycle 16: 3-2-0-1-3
- Cycle 17: 2-0-1-5-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, (6, 4), 9>
- <9, (4, 7), 6>
- <6, (7, 0), 4>
- <4, (0, 2), 7>
- <7, (2, 5), 0>
- <0, (5, 1), 2>
- <2, (1, 4), 5>
- <5, (1, 4), 7>
- <1, (4, 7), 5>
- <3, (6, 4), 7>
- <6, (8, 9), 3>
- <8, (9, 7), 6>
- <9, (8, 6), 7>
- <8, (6, 3), 2>
- <6, (3, 2), 0>
- <3, (2, 0), 1>
- <2, (0, 1), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 17 chordless cycles found. So, the answer is [17].
