Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles with length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-8-5
- Cycle 2: 5-2-0-7-5
- Cycle 3: 9-4-0-7-9
- Cycle 4: 1-9-0-7-1
- Cycle 5: 1-3-6-8-1
- Cycle 6: 3-1-9-4-3
- Cycle 7: 4-8-6-3-4
- Cycle 8: 8-7-0-2-8
- Cycle 9: 6-5-4-0-6
- Cycle 10: 0-2-7-1-0

Step 2:
Out of the 10 cycles listed above, the following 8 cycles have exactly one chord:
1. <5, (4, 8), 9>
2. <5, (2, 0), 7>
3. <9, (0, 4), 7>
4. <1, (0, 7), 9>
5. <1, (3, 6), 8>
6. <3, (1, 9), 4>
7. <4, (6, 3), 8>
8. <8, (0, 2), 7>

Step 3:
Out of the 8 cycles with exactly one chord, all are unique chordal 4-cycles. 
Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
