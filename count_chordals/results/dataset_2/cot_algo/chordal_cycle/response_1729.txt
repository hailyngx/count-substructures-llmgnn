Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 8) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) (0, 17) (7, 3) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 11) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 15) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 1) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 1) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 2-18-8-2
- Cycle 2: 2-11-4-16-2
- Cycle 3: 2-8-3-7-2
- Cycle 4: 2-14-3-6-2
- Cycle 5: 4-19-13-5-4
- Cycle 6: 4-11-19-13-4
- Cycle 7: 4-16-13-5-4
- Cycle 8: 8-2-18-14-8
- Cycle 9: 8-3-6-10-8
- Cycle 10: 8-18-14-1-8
- Cycle 11: 13-5-19-11-13
- Cycle 12: 13-16-4-11-13
- Cycle 13: 13-19-11-2-13
- Cycle 14: 13-1-14-3-13
- Cycle 15: 16-4-10-6-16
- Cycle 16: 16-13-19-11-16
- Cycle 17: 3-8-18-2-3
- Cycle 18: 3-7-6-10-3
- Cycle 19: 3-14-1-9-3
- Cycle 20: 5-13-19-11-5
- Cycle 21: 5-15-16-4-5
- Cycle 22: 5-17-0-17-5
- Cycle 23: 9-15-16-13-9
- Cycle 24: 12-13-19-11-12
- Cycle 25: 1-13-19-11-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <2, (8, 18), 14, 3>
- <11, (4, 16), 13, 19>
- (Cycle 10) has two chords: (18, 14) and (14, 1)
- (Cycle 24) has two chords: (13, 19) and (19, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [2].
