Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 3, 9, 8, 7>
<0, 3, 9, 8, 4>
<0, 3, 4, 8, 7>
<0, 3, 4, 8, 1>
<0, 3, 4, 5, 6>
<0, 3, 2, 7, 8>
<0, 3, 2, 7, 1>
<0, 3, 2, 4, 5>
<0, 8, 4, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 4, 3, 2>
<0, 8, 7, 1, 6>
<0, 8, 7, 2, 3>
<0, 5, 4, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 4, 3, 2>
<0, 5, 6, 1, 7>
<0, 5, 6, 1, 8>
<1, 7, 2, 3, 9>
<1, 7, 2, 3, 4>
<2, 7, 1, 8, 4>
<2, 7, 1, 8, 9>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
Only one chord can be added to form a chordal 4-cycle in the following cycles:
<0, 3, 9, 8, 7> -> One chord: (0, 8)
<0, 3, 9, 8, 4> -> One chord: (3, 8)
<0, 3, 2, 4, 5> -> One chord: (3, 5)
<0, 8, 4, 3, 9> -> One chord: (8, 9)
<0, 8, 7, 1, 6> -> One chord: (1, 7)
<0, 5, 4, 3, 9> -> One chord: (5, 9)
<0, 5, 6, 1, 7> -> One chord: (6, 7)
<1, 7, 2, 3, 9> -> One chord: (7, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the answer is [8].
