- Cycle 9: 2-8-18-0-2
- Cycle 10: 2-8-3-12-2
- Cycle 11: 3-8-18-0-3
- Cycle 12: 3-12-5-13-3
- Cycle 13: 3-12-10-6-3

- Cycle 22: 8-14-3-12-8
- Cycle 23: 10-12-3-8-10
- Cycle 24: 10-12-5-13-10
- Cycle 25: 10-16-17-6-10
- Cycle 26: 13-15-11-5-13
- Cycle 27: 16-10-12-3-16
- Cycle 28: 17-19-9-4-17

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (4-13)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4-9)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (4-7)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (4-19)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (18-8)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (18-0)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (2-18)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (8-18)
- Cycle 13 has a chord (8-12)
- Cycle 15 has a chord (7-8)
- Cycle 18 has a chord (9-19)
- Cycle 20 has a chord (1-18)
- Cycle 22 has a chord (8-3)
- Cycle 24 has a chord (12-5)
- Cycle 27 has a chord (12-3)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count is [14].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1, (4, 13), 5>
2. <1, (4, 9), 19>
3. <1, (4, 7), 2>
4. <1, (4, 19), 17>
5. <18, (8, 2), 1>
6. <18, (8, 3), 12>
7. <18, (8, 14), 3>
8. <18, (8, 18), 0>
9. <2, (8, 18), 0>
10. <10, (12, 5), 13>
11. <8, (14, 3), 12>
12. <3, (8, 12), 10>
13. <17, (19, 9), 4>
14. <12, (16, 6), 10>
