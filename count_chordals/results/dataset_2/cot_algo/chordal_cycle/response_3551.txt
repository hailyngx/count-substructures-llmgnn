Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1:  
Possible 4-cycles in the graph considering only existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-4-6
- Cycle 2: 6-8-13-6
- Cycle 3: 6-8-2-6
- Cycle 4: 6-4-9-6
- Cycle 5: 9-12-8-6
- Cycle 6: 9-11-7-9
- Cycle 7: 9-4-6-9
- Cycle 8: 8-5-2-8
- Cycle 9: 13-0-1-13
- Cycle 10: 13-10-6-13
- Cycle 11: 0-3-7-1
- Cycle 12: 0-14-10-6
- Cycle 13: 2-5-8-2
- Cycle 14: 7-1-13-7
- Cycle 15: 7-3-0-14
- Cycle 16: 4-6-10-4
- Cycle 17: 12-3-7-11

Step 2:
Identifying the chordal 4-cycles:
- <6, 4, 9, 6> with chord (4,9)
- <6, 8, 13, 6> with chord (8,13)
- <8, 2, 6, 8> with chord (2,6)
- <9, 4, 6, 9> with chord (4,6)

Step 3:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the count is [4].
