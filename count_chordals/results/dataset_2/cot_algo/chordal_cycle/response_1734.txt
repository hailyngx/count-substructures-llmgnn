Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 5, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 7, 4, 6)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 5, 6)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 5: (7, 2, 1, 7)
- Cycle 6: (2, 1, 0, 2)
- Cycle 7: (1, 0, 8, 1)
- Cycle 8: (0, 8, 3, 0)
- Cycle 9: (8, 3, 9, 8)
- Cycle 10: (3, 9, 6, 3)

Step 2:
- <1, (6, 4), 5> (Chord between 6 and 4)
- <2, (7, 4), 6> (Chord between 7 and 4)
- <3, (6, 7), 4> (Chord between 6 and 7)
- <4, (5, 7), 2> (Chord between 5 and 7)
- <5, (2, 1), 7> (Chord between 2 and 1)
- <6, (1, 0), 2> (Chord between 1 and 0)
- <7, (0, 8), 1> (Chord between 0 and 8)
- <8, (8, 3), 0> (Chord between 8 and 3)
- <9, (3, 9), 8> (Chord between 3 and 9)
- <10, (9, 6), 3> (Chord between 9 and 6)

Step 3:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final result is [10].
