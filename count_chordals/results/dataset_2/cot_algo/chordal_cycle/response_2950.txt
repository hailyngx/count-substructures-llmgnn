Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 18) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 16) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 3) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 3) (2, 6) (2, 15) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 18) (3, 9) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 10) (8, 5) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 9) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 1) (4, 17) (4, 11) (4, 1) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 1) (15, 5) (15, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 11, 7, 12, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 2, 15, 5, 8, 10, 12, 7, 11, 0>
- Cycle 4: <3, 17, 6, 0, 19, 18, 7, 11, 4, 1, 9, 3>
- Cycle 5: <4, 1, 12, 7, 18, 19, 0, 6, 2, 15, 5, 8, 10, 11, 7, 12, 10, 16, 1>
- Cycle 6: <5, 8, 10, 11, 7, 12, 1, 16, 5>
- Cycle 7: <6, 17, 3, 9, 1, 12, 7, 18, 19, 0>
- Cycle 8: <9, 1, 12, 7, 11, 4, 17, 3, 18, 19, 0>
- Cycle 9: <15, 5, 8, 10, 12, 1, 4, 11, 7, 18, 19, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord between 11 and 4
- Cycle 2 has a chord between 11 and 7
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has no chord
- Cycle 5 has a chord between 1 and 12
- Cycle 6 has no chord
- Cycle 7 has no chord
- Cycle 8 has a chord between 1 and 12
- Cycle 9 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
As analyzed, there are 3 chordal 4-cycles.
Therefore, the final number is [3].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 11, 4, 1, 0>
<0, 11, 7, 12, 0>
<4, 1, 12, 7, 18, 19, 0, 6, 2, 15, 5, 8, 10, 11, 7, 12, 10, 16, 1>
