Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
<0, 7, 1, 6> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 7, 4, 5> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 7, 4, 6> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 7, 3, 1> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 7, 3, 5> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 7, 3, 4> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 7, 2, 9> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 9, 2, 7> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 9, 8, 6> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 9, 8, 3> - Cycle of length 4
<1, 7, 4, 5> - Cycle of length 4
<1, 7, 4, 6> - Cycle of length 4
<1, 7, 3, 5> - Cycle of length 4
<1, 7, 3, 4> - Cycle of length 4
<1, 6, 4, 5> - Cycle of length 4
<2, 7, 0, 9> - Cycle of length 4
<3, 7, 0, 1> - Cycle of length 4
<3, 7, 1, 5> - Cycle of length 4
<3, 7, 4, 5> - Cycle of length 4
<3, 5, 1, 7> - Cycle of length 4
<3, 5, 1, 4> - Cycle of length 4
<3, 5, 4, 7> - Cycle of length 4
<3, 4, 7, 1> - Cycle of length 4
<3, 4, 7, 0> - Cycle of length 4
<3, 8, 6, 9> - Cycle of length 4
<3, 8, 9, 2> - Cycle of length 4
<3, 8, 0, 7> - Cycle of length 4
<5, 4, 7, 1> - Cycle of length 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
Chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 7, 1, 6, (4, 3)>
<0, 7, 4, 5, (1, 3)>
<0, 7, 4, 6, (1, 2)>
<1, 7, 3, 5, (4, 6)>
<3, 5, 1, 7, (4, 0)>
<3, 4, 7, 1, (5, 6)>
<3, 8, 0, 7, (9, 2)>
<5, 4, 7, 1, (3, 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [8].
