Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 4) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 2) (0, 17) (0, 5) (7, 19) (7, 17) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 17) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 15) (12, 6) (12, 4) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 15) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 17) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 19) (17, 2) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 1) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph (ensuring all edges exist):
1. Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 1 - 6 - 12 - 4 - 9 - 13 - 18 - 5 - 0
2. Cycle 2: 2 - 1 - 6 - 8 - 19 - 17 - 2
3. Cycle 3: 3 - 16 - 14 - 15 - 4 - 9 - 13 - 3
4. Cycle 4: 5 - 3 - 16 - 15 - 8 - 19 - 17 - 5
5. Cycle 5: 7 - 19 - 17 - 0 - 5 - 18 - 13 - 7
6. Cycle 6: 10 - 5 - 0 - 17 - 19 - 8 - 6 - 1 - 10
7. Cycle 7: 11 - 2 - 1 - 6 - 8 - 15 - 4 - 12 - 11

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle 1 has one chord: (4, 18) <0, 5, 12, 9>
2. Cycle 2 has one chord: (2, 6) <1, 17, 19, 8>
3. Cycle 3 has one chord: (3, 9) <13, 4, 15, 16>
4. Cycle 4 has one chord: (5, 15) <3, 8, 16, 19>
5. Cycle 5 has one chord: (7, 5) <13, 17, 18, 19>
6. Cycle 6 has one chord: (6, 10) <0, 1, 5, 8>
7. Cycle 7 has one chord: (11, 1) <2, 6, 12, 15>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
