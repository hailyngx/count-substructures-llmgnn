Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 are:
- (6, 1, 4, 7)
- (6, 1, 13, 10)
- (6, 3, 2, 5)
- (6, 3, 13, 11)
- (4, 0, 10, 7)
- (4, 0, 11, 2)
- (4, 1, 13, 10)
- (4, 1, 6, 3)
- (4, 3, 13, 11)
- (7, 0, 11, 2)
- (7, 0, 10, 1)
- (7, 4, 1, 6)
- (7, 4, 3, 13)
- (8, 9, 14, 7)
- (9, 14, 1, 6)
- (13, 8, 9, 14)
- (13, 8, 9, 14)
- (13, 10, 1, 6)
- (13, 10, 0, 4)
- (13, 10, 7, 4)
- (13, 11, 0, 4)
- (13, 11, 2, 5)
- (13, 11, 4, 1)
- (0, 4, 1, 13)
- (0, 4, 3, 6)
- (0, 7, 4, 1)
- (0, 7, 10, 13)
- (0, 11, 2, 13)
- (1, 4, 3, 6)
- (1, 6, 10, 13)
- (1, 10, 13, 11)
- (2, 3, 6, 1)
- (2, 3, 13, 11)
- (2, 5, 4, 1)
- (2, 5, 13, 11)

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <6, (1, 4), 7)
- <4, (3, 13), 11>
- <7, (0, 10), 4>
- <13, (8, 14), 9>
- <13, (10, 1), 6>
- <2, (3, 11), 6>
- <2, (5, 1), 4>

The number of chordless cycles found is [7].
