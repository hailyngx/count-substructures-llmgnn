Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 1, 6)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 7, 2)
- Cycle 3: (5, 2, 9, 7)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 4, 6)
- Cycle 5: (9, 2, 7, 4)
- Cycle 6: (6, 1, 8, 2)

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, the only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 1: (5, 4, 1, 6) with the chord (4, 1).

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, (4, 1), 6>
