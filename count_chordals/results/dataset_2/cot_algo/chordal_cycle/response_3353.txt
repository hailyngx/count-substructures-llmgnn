Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-7-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-6-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-7-1-0
- Cycle 4: 0-2-9-1-0
- Cycle 5: 1-7-8-6-1
- Cycle 6: 1-6-4-0-1
- Cycle 7: 1-6-3-7-1
- Cycle 8: 1-2-9-6-1
- Cycle 9: 2-9-6-4-2
- Cycle 10: 2-1-7-8-2
- Cycle 11: 2-0-4-6-2
- Cycle 12: 3-0-4-6-3
- Cycle 13: 3-7-8-1-3
- Cycle 14: 4-0-3-7-4
- Cycle 15: 4-6-1-7-4
- Cycle 16: 4-6-3-7-4
- Cycle 17: 5-0-4-6-5
- Cycle 18: 5-7-8-1-5
- Cycle 19: 6-1-7-8-6
- Cycle 20: 6-4-0-5-6
- Cycle 21: 6-3-7-8-6
- Cycle 22: 9-2-1-7-9
- Cycle 23: 9-1-6-4-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <0, (5, 7), 1, 4>
- <0, (4, 6), 1, 7>
- <0, (3, 7), 1, 6>
- <0, (2, 9), 1, 7>
- <1, (7, 8), 6, 4>
- <1, (6, 4), 0, 7>
- <1, (6, 3), 7, 8>
- <1, (2, 9), 6, 4>
- <2, (9, 6), 1, 7>
- <2, (7, 8), 1, 9>
- <3, (7, 8), 1, 6>
- <4, (3, 7), 0, 6>
- <4, (1, 7), 6, 3>
- <5, (0, 4), 6, 7>
- <5, (7, 8), 1, 0>
- <6, (1, 7), 4, 8>
- <6, (4, 0), 5, 3>
- <6, (3, 7), 4, 8>
- <7, (1, 2), 9, 6>
- <7, (8, 6), 1, 3>
- <8, (7, 1), 6, 4>
- <9, (2, 1), 7, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0].
