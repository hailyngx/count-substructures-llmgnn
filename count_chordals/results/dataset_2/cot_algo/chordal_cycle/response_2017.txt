Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - <1, 26, 6, 4> has one chord: (26, 4)
        - <1, 26, 10, 21> has one chord: (26, 21)
        - <1, 16, 24, 0> has one chord: (16, 0)
        - <21, 10, 7, 12> has one chord: (10, 7)
        - <21, 9, 17, 18> has one chord: (9, 18)
        - <14, 6, 4, 23> has one chord: (6, 23)
        - <17, 9, 22, 5> has one chord: (9, 5)
        - <3, 25, 23, 4> has one chord: (25, 4)
        - <3, 11, 19, 5> has one chord: (11, 19)
        - <25, 23, 27, 12> has one chord: (23, 12)
        - <8, 13, 29, 10> has one chord: (13, 10)
        - <8, 18, 5, 22> has one chord: (18, 22)
        - <8, 7, 10, 21> has one chord: (7, 21)
        - <13, 8, 18, 17> has one chord: (8, 17)
        - <12, 27, 23, 4> has one chord: (27, 4)
        - <26, 1, 20, 16> has one chord: (1, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 75 chordless cycles.
        
        Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [15].
