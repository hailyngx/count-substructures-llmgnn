Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (1, 5) (1, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 6) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-11-8-5
- Cycle 2: 5-7-12-11-5
- Cycle 3: 5-2-3-12-5
- Cycle 4: 5-13-11-14-5
- Cycle 5: 9-4-6-13-9
- Cycle 6: 9-14-12-3-9
- Cycle 7: 1-5-7-6-1
- Cycle 8: 1-11-12-14-1
- Cycle 9: 3-2-6-8-3
- Cycle 10: 7-12-14-9-7
- Cycle 11: 12-3-2-6-12
- Cycle 12: 12-7-10-14-12
- Cycle 13: 2-5-13-11-2
- Cycle 14: 8-11-13-0-8
- Cycle 15: 13-5-1-11-13
- Cycle 16: 13-11-12-14-13
- Cycle 17: 11-1-5-7-11
- Cycle 18: 11-12-3-2-11
- Cycle 19: 11-8-6-4-11
- Cycle 20: 11-14-10-13-11
- Cycle 21: 14-9-4-6-14

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: 
<5, (1, 11), 8>

Step 3:
Since there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
