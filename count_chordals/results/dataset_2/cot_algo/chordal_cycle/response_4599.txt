Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with all existing edges:

<5, 9, 6, 7>
<5, 9, 6, 2>
<5, 9, 2, 1>
<9, 6, 7, 12>
<9, 6, 2, 1>
<9, 6, 2, 13>
<6, 7, 12, 10>
<6, 7, 12, 14>
<6, 2, 13, 11>
<7, 12, 10, 1>
<7, 12, 10, 11>
<7, 12, 14, 4>
<12, 10, 1, 4>
<12, 10, 11, 4>
<10, 1, 4, 14>
<11, 14, 4, 1>

Step 2: Check for chordal 4-cycles:

<5, 9, 6, 7> has a chord (9, 7) 
<5, 9, 6, 2> is chordless
<5, 9, 2, 1> is chordless
<9, 6, 7, 12> has a chord (6, 12)
<9, 6, 2, 1> is chordless
<9, 6, 2, 13> is chordless
<6, 7, 12, 10> is chordless
<6, 7, 12, 14> is chordless
<6, 2, 13, 11> is chordless
<7, 12, 10, 1> is chordless
<7, 12, 10, 11> is chordless
<7, 12, 14, 4> is chordless
<12, 10, 1, 4> is chordless
<12, 10, 11, 4> is chordless
<10, 1, 4, 14> is chordless
<11, 14, 4, 1> is chordless

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are [2] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph:
- <5, 9, 6, 7> with chord (9, 7)
- <9, 6, 7, 12> with chord (6, 12)
