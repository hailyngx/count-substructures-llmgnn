Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 4) (6, 18) (6, 16) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 19) (18, 8) (18, 6) (18, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 14) (0, 16) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 3) (12, 16) (12, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (11, 18) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 3) (3, 8) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 14) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 2) (9, 12) (9, 11) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 8 - 1 - 13 - 5 - 8
- Cycle 2: 8 - 18 - 6 - 16 - 8
- Cycle 3: 13 - 1 - 17 - 19 - 13
- Cycle 4: 5 - 4 - 19 - 17 - 5
- Cycle 5: 10 - 15 - 14 - 2 - 10
- Cycle 6: 16 - 6 - 18 - 11 - 16
- Cycle 7: 16 - 0 - 3 - 14 - 16
- Cycle 8: 16 - 12 - 9 - 11 - 16
- Cycle 9: 7 - 2 - 14 - 3 - 7

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 13) as <8, (5, 13), 1>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (11, 18) as <8, (11, 18), 6>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 17) as <13, (1, 17), 19>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (4, 17) as <5, (4, 17), 19>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (10, 14) as <10, (10, 14), 15>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (6, 11) as <16, (6, 11), 18>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (0, 14) as <16, (0, 14), 3>
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (9, 12) as <16, (9, 12), 11>
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (2, 3) as <7, (2, 3), 14>

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 0.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
