Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 14) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 0, 12, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 7, 10, 9, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 11, 2, 9, 6, 4)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 6, 2, 11, 4, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 13, 10, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 10, 7, 12, 6, 9)
- Cycle 7: (6, 2, 11, 4, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 4, 5, 0, 12, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 13, 10, 12, 7, 6)
- Cycle 10: (10, 7, 8, 2, 11, 10)
- Cycle 11: (11, 8, 7, 1, 5, 4, 11)
- Cycle 12: (7, 12, 0, 5, 1, 7)
- Cycle 13: (12, 0, 5, 4, 11, 12)
- Cycle 14: (2, 11, 4, 6, 13, 2)
- Cycle 15: (2, 14, 8, 7, 1, 5, 0, 12, 2)
- Cycle 16: (8, 11, 4, 6, 9, 10, 7, 8)
- Cycle 17: (4, 5, 0, 13, 10, 7, 4)
- Cycle 18: (5, 3, 6, 13, 0, 5)
- Cycle 19: (5, 1, 7, 8, 14, 2, 6, 3, 5)
- Cycle 20: (13, 0, 12, 7, 10, 6, 13)
- Cycle 21: (13, 1, 7, 10, 12, 0, 13)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles):
- <1, (5, 7), 10, 9>
- <2, (6, 13), 10, 12>
- <3, (6, 13), 0, 5>
- <4, (9, 10), 7, 12>
- <5, (11, 2), 4, 6>
- <6, (14, 8), 7, 1>
- <7, (14, 8), 2, 11>
- <8, (5, 0), 12, 6>
- <9, (5, 0), 13, 10>
- <10, (5, 3), 6, 2>
- <11, (7, 1), 5, 4>
- <12, (7, 1), 13, 0>

Step 3:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found, thus [12].
