Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 4) (27, 10) (27, 3) (27, 9) (27, 5) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 12) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 12) (8, 28) (8, 29) (23, 11) (23, 1) (10, 27) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 22) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 26) (26, 17) (26, 28) (26, 14) (28, 8) (28, 26) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 1) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 22) (2, 6) (22, 10) (22, 2) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 14) (14, 26) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 24) (12, 20) (12, 25) (12, 19) (9, 27) (9, 18) (18, 9) (18, 21) (18, 3) (4, 15) (29, 8) (29, 7) (29, 3) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (1, 20) (1, 23) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (5, 27) (5, 25) (5, 11) (5, 24) (3, 27) (3, 14) (3, 18) (3, 29) (0, 21) (0, 24) (21, 18) (21, 0) (24, 14) (24, 5) (24, 0) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 13) (13, 16) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: {1, 20, 12, 19, 1} with corresponding edges {(1, 20), (20, 12), (12, 19), (19, 1)}.
- Cycle 2: {1, 20, 25, 5, 11, 1} with corresponding edges {(1, 20), (20, 25), (25, 5), (5, 11), (11, 1)}.
- Cycle 3: {1, 20, 25, 12, 19, 1} with corresponding edges {(1, 20), (20, 25), (25, 12), (12, 19), (19, 1)}.
- Cycle 4: {1, 7, 29, 3, 27, 10, 22, 2, 11, 19, 12, 20, 25, 5, 24, 0, 21, 18, 9, 27, 5, 11, 2, 6, 13, 16, 19, 11, 23, 1} with corresponding edges {(1, 7), (7, 29), (29, 3), (3, 27), (27, 10), (10, 22), (22, 2), (2, 11), (11, 19), (19, 12), (12, 20), (20, 25), (25, 5), (5, 24), (24, 0), (0, 21), (21, 18), (18, 9), (9, 27), (27, 5), (5, 11), (11, 2), (2, 6), (6, 13), (13, 16), (16, 19), (19, 11), (11, 23), (23, 1)}.

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Checking Cycle 1 for chords: None found.
- Checking Cycle 2 for chords: None found.
- Checking Cycle 3 for chords: None found.
- Checking Cycle 4 for chords: Chords found are {20, 5}, {25, 12}, and {2, 22}.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

- Total chordless cycles found: [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
- <1, 20, 25, 12, 19, 1>
- <1, 20, 25, 5, 11, 1>
- <1, 20, 12, 19, 1>
