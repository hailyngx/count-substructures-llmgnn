Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
        - Cycle 1: <1, 2, 9, 3, 1>
        - Cycle 2: <1, 8, 5, 14, 1>
        - Cycle 3: <2, 9, 3, 8, 2>
        - Cycle 4: <3, 9, 11, 6, 3>
        - Cycle 5: <4, 9, 3, 13, 4>
        - Cycle 6: <4, 9, 11, 6, 4>
        - Cycle 7: <5, 8, 3, 9, 5>
        - Cycle 8: <6, 11, 9, 4, 6>
        - Cycle 9: <7, 4, 8, 6, 7>
        - Cycle 10: <9, 4, 13, 0, 9>
        - Cycle 11: <10, 1, 8, 3, 10>
        - Cycle 12: <11, 9, 4, 7, 11>
        - Cycle 13: <11, 14, 6, 7, 11>
        - Cycle 14: <12, 4, 7, 6, 12>
        - Cycle 15: <13, 3, 9, 11, 13>
        - Cycle 16: <14, 5, 8, 6, 14>
        - Cycle 17: <14, 12, 2, 2, 13>

Step 2:
        - The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <1, 8, 3, 10> with chord (1, 3).

Step 3: 
        The total number of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
