Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 29) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 26) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (22, 5) (22, 28) (23, 25) (23, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 1) (17, 16) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (2, 27) (2, 6) (2, 20) (18, 0) (18, 8) (20, 15) (20, 2) (5, 16) (5, 22) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 3) (26, 27) (8, 17) (8, 18) (8, 19) (8, 21) (19, 23) (19, 8) (19, 29) (4, 6) (4, 3) (12, 15) (12, 25) (12, 1) (21, 16) (21, 8) (21, 24) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 28) (3, 13) (3, 4) (24, 21) (24, 7) (7, 9) (7, 24) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 25) (25, 11) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 1) (29, 11) (29, 19) (29, 0) (28, 22) (28, 14) (0, 18) (0, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (11, 10, 15, 27, 11)
- Cycle 2: (16, 21, 24, 7, 9, 14, 16)
- Cycle 3: (16, 17, 10, 1, 9, 14, 16)
- Cycle 4: (16, 5, 22, 28, 14, 9, 16)
- Cycle 5: (15, 10, 17, 13, 6, 2, 15)
- Cycle 6: (15, 10, 17, 8, 19, 23, 25, 12, 1, 9, 14, 28, 22, 5, 16, 14, 9, 1, 12, 25, 23, 19, 8, 17, 13, 5, 22, 28, 14, 9, 1, 10, 15)
- Cycle 7: (27, 15, 10, 1, 12, 25, 23, 19, 8, 21, 24, 7, 9, 1, 10, 17, 16, 14, 9, 1, 12, 25, 23, 8, 19, 29, 0, 18, 8, 17, 13, 5, 16, 11, 25, 12, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has chord <10, 14>.
- Cycle 4 has chord <5, 9>.
- Cycle 5 has chord <10, 2>.
- Cycle 6 has no chords.
- Cycle 7 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 4 chordless cycles found. So, the final answer is [4].
