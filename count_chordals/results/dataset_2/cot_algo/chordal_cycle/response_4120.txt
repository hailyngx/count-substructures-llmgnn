        - Cycle 21: {14, 19, 13, 1, 7, 2, 17, 3, 6, 16, 18, 0, 15, 14}
        - Cycle 22: {15, 2, 7, 1, 13, 19, 14, 15}
        - Cycle 23: {15, 14, 19, 13, 1, 7, 2, 17, 3, 6, 16, 18, 0, 15}
        - Cycle 24: {16, 6, 3, 10, 8, 7, 2, 17, 9, 0, 15, 14, 19, 16}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        <3, 6, 16, 3> - Chord: (6, 16)
        <3, 10, 8, 7, 1, 13, 19, 11, 3> - Chord: (8, 10)
        <7, 1, 13, 19, 11, 0, 9, 17, 3, 6, 16, 1> - Chord: (0, 9)
        <8, 10, 3, 6, 16, 18, 0, 15, 14, 19, 13, 1, 7, 8> - Chord: (13, 19)

        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <3, 6, 16, 3>
        <3, 10, 8, 7, 1, 13, 19, 11, 3>
        <7, 1, 13, 19, 11, 0, 9, 17, 3, 6, 16, 1>
        <8, 10, 3, 6, 16, 18, 0, 15, 14, 19, 13, 1, 7, 8>
