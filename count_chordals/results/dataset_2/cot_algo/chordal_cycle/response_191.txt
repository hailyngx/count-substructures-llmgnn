Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 22) (21, 3) (21, 29) (21, 14) (18, 22) (18, 24) (18, 25) (18, 29) (22, 1) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 20) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 17) (13, 5) (17, 5) (17, 20) (17, 2) (20, 22) (20, 17) (20, 3) (20, 6) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 27) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 23) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 14) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 4) (28, 24) (14, 21) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 8) (14, 29) (25, 18) (25, 27) (25, 16) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 25) (27, 2) (6, 20) (6, 19) (24, 18) (24, 28) (24, 9) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 12) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 14) (7, 9) (11, 9) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 14) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 19) (0, 26) (9, 24) (9, 7) (9, 11) (12, 3) (12, 19) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 27) (2, 11) (4, 3) (4, 28) (4, 23) (23, 10) (23, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-22-18-25-16
- Cycle 2: 21-14-26-28-27
- Cycle 3: 21-29-18-24-28
- Cycle 4: 5-13-17-20-22
- Cycle 5: 3-20-17-2-27
- Cycle 6: 3-4-28-26-14
- Cycle 7: 10-15-14-21-29
- Cycle 8: 10-2-17-20-3
- Cycle 9: 10-23-4-28-27
- Cycle 10: 24-18-22-20-3
- Cycle 11: 6-20-17-2-27
- Cycle 12: 6-19-16-25-18
- Cycle 13: 24-28-27-2-17

Step 2:
After checking each cycle, we find that only Cycle 4: 5-13-17-20-22 has exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes), which is the edge (13, 22).

Step 3:
The final number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (13, 22), 5>
