Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (15, 21) (15, 12) (21, 15) (21, 17) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 24) (13, 28) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 17) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 4) (25, 9) (25, 20) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 29) (3, 18) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 5) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 27) (28, 13) (28, 16) (28, 18) (28, 23) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 4) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 0) (6, 19) (6, 14) (6, 4) (24, 8) (24, 13) (24, 29) (23, 26) (23, 28) (23, 29) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 2) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 17) (29, 3) (29, 16) (29, 24) (29, 23) (29, 4) (22, 20) (22, 27) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 22) (17, 21) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 20) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 29) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (9, 26, 1, 20, 25, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 26, 23, 28, 13, 8, 10, 11, 17, 21, 15, 12, 3, 0, 19, 6, 14, 2, 4, 20, 25, 9)
- Cycle 3: (15, 21, 17, 7, 20, 1, 5, 12, 3, 0, 19, 10, 8, 13, 28, 23, 26, 9, 25, 20)
- Cycle 4: (8, 13, 28, 27, 22, 20, 1, 7, 17, 11, 10, 8)
- Cycle 5: (10, 8, 13, 28, 18, 3, 12, 5, 1, 20, 7, 17, 11)
- Cycle 6: (20, 25, 9, 27, 22, 21, 17, 7, 1, 26, 23, 28, 13)
- Cycle 7: (25, 20, 22, 27, 16, 29, 24, 8, 10, 19, 0, 3, 12, 15)
- Cycle 8: (1, 26, 23, 28, 18, 3, 12, 15, 21, 17, 11, 10)
- Cycle 9: (3, 12, 15, 21, 17, 11, 10, 8, 13, 28, 16, 27, 22)
- Cycle 10: (12, 15, 21, 17, 7, 20, 25, 9, 27, 22, 20, 1)
- Cycle 11: (16, 28, 18, 3, 0, 19, 10, 8, 13, 24, 29, 23)
- Cycle 12: (28, 18, 3, 0, 19, 6, 14, 2, 10, 8, 24, 29)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, (28, 13), 26, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [11]
