Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 15) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 25) (26, 8) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 16) (14, 24) (17, 16) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 2) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 12) (22, 11) (22, 20) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 6) (3, 29) (25, 26) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 4) (0, 18) (0, 29) (0, 1) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 15) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 10) (20, 22) (20, 13) (20, 11) (29, 3) (29, 0) (29, 12) (21, 13) (8, 26) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 16) (4, 25) (12, 18) (12, 29) (28, 17) (11, 22) (11, 20) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 2) (24, 14) (24, 3) (24, 11) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 19) (2, 26) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 11) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 23) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 27) (7, 6) (7, 27) (27, 18) (27, 16) (27, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (9, 15, 10, 13, 9)
- Cycle 2: (26, 13, 21, 13, 26)
- Cycle 3: (26, 2, 6, 1, 5, 23, 17, 16, 6, 2, 26)
- Cycle 4: (26, 25, 23, 5, 1, 0, 18, 27, 16, 17, 23, 25, 26)
- Cycle 5: (26, 25, 4, 25, 3, 22, 20, 11, 24, 14, 24, 3, 25, 26)
- Cycle 6: (26, 8, 26)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (9, 15), 6>
- <2, (13, 21), 26>
- <3, (5, 23), 17>
- <4, (26, 25), 23>
- <5, (25, 4), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, we found 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
