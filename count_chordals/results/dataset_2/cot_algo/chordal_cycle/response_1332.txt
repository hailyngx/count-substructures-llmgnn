Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 18) (8, 3) (8, 14) (13, 11) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 17) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 11) (17, 16) (17, 7) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 19) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 18) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 7) (18, 6) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 11, 14, 12, 2, 15, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 6, 10, 7, 17, 16, 3, 18, 15, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 15, 18, 3, 16, 0, 1, 4, 15, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
  
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (11, 14)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (10, 7)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (0, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph, so the count is [0].
