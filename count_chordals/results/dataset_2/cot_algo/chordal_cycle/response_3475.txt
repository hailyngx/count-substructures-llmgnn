Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-9-4-1
- Cycle 2: 2-5-10-13-2
- Cycle 3: 2-5-7-8-2
- Cycle 4: 2-12-7-5-2
- Cycle 5: 4-9-6-0-4
- Cycle 6: 8-13-10-5-8
- Cycle 7: 8-7-10-5-8
- Cycle 8: 14-2-3-8-14
- Cycle 9: 14-4-9-10-14

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (6, 4)
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has no chords
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (12, 5)
- Cycle 5 has no chords
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (13, 10)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (3, 2)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (9, 10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (6, 4), 9)>
<4, (12, 5), 2)>
<8, (3, 2), 14)>
