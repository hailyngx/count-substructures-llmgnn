Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <15, 27, 24, 19> - Chord: (27, 24)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <15, 27, 16, 21> - Chord: (27, 21)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <15, 29, 1, 3> - Chord: (29, 1)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <22, 23, 25, 4> - Chord: (23, 25)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <23, 22, 12, 3> - Chord: (22, 12)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <28, 23, 12, 3> - Chord: (23, 12)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <0, 21, 16, 27> - Chord: (21, 16)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <14, 15, 29, 1> - Chord: (15, 29)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <16, 27, 24, 19> - Chord: (27, 24)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <11, 5, 21, 16> - Chord: (5, 21)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 90 - 10 = 80
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [80].
