Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 7) (4, 7) (7, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 0) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 2) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 8) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 9) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 8) (9, 15) (9, 0) (10, 19) (10, 16) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 8) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 6) (8, 16) (2, 3) (2, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

- Cycle 1: (17, 14, 16, 6, 17)
- Cycle 2: (7, 17, 14, 16, 7)
- Cycle 3: (5, 18, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 13, 0, 15, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 13, 3, 2, 5)
- Cycle 6: (13, 3, 2, 11, 13)
- Cycle 7: (13, 3, 11, 8, 13)
- Cycle 8: (15, 1, 16, 6, 15)
- Cycle 9: (15, 1, 16, 10, 15)
- Cycle 10: (15, 0, 13, 12, 15)
- Cycle 11: (15, 0, 13, 5, 15)
- Cycle 12: (16, 14, 17, 6, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, 0, (15, 5), 16>
- <13, 2, (3, 11), 5>
- <13, 15, (5, 12), 0>
- <14, 17, (6, 16), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
