Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 1) (14, 0) (14, 3) (17, 9) (17, 12) (17, 18) (10, 4) (10, 16) (11, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 14) (3, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (19, 16) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 13) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 1) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 15) (6, 18) (6, 15) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 17 - 18 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 13 - 4 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 1 - 8 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 4: 9 - 17 - 12 - 13 - 9
- Cycle 5: 14 - 0 - 2 - 12 - 14
- Cycle 6: 18 - 16 - 10 - 4 - 18
- Cycle 7: 18 - 16 - 19 - 16 - 18
- Cycle 8: 18 - 7 - 15 - 6 - 18
- Cycle 9: 9 - 1 - 8 - 7 - 9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <5, (9, 17), 18, 13>

Based on the unique chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [8].
