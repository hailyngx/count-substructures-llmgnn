Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 6-9-2-3-6
- Cycle 2: 6-5-2-9-6
- Cycle 3: 6-5-4-8-6
- Cycle 4: 6-1-0-2-6
- Cycle 5: 6-1-5-4-6
- Cycle 6: 6-7-8-4-6
- Cycle 7: 6-7-8-0-6
- Cycle 8: 6-4-5-2-6
- Cycle 9: 6-4-2-9-6
- Cycle 10: 6-4-3-2-6
- Cycle 11: 6-0-2-4-6
- Cycle 12: 6-0-8-7-6
- Cycle 13: 6-9-2-0-6
- Cycle 14: 6-5-2-4-6
- Cycle 15: 6-1-0-8-6
- Cycle 16: 6-7-8-4-5-6
- Cycle 17: 6-5-4-8-0-6
- Cycle 18: 6-0-2-3-6
- Cycle 19: 6-4-3-9-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord 2-6.
- Cycle 2 has a chord 5-6.
- Cycle 3 has a chord 4-6.
- Cycle 4 has a chord 1-6.
- Cycle 5 has a chord 1-6.
- Cycle 6 has a chord 6-8.
- Cycle 7 has a chord 7-6.
- Cycle 8 has a chord 5-6.
- Cycle 9 has a chord 9-6.
- Cycle 10 has a chord 4-6.
- Cycle 11 has a chord 0-6.
- Cycle 12 has a chord 8-6.
- Cycle 13 has a chord 6-2.
- Cycle 14 has a chord 4-6.
- Cycle 15 has a chord 0-6.
- Cycle 16 has a chord 4-6.
- Cycle 17 has a chord 8-6.
- Cycle 18 has a chord 2-6.
- Cycle 19 has a chord 9-6.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 19 chordal 4-cycles found.

Answer: [19]
Unique chordal 4-cycle: <6, (2, 6)>
