Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 4-1-7-6-4
- Cycle 2: 1-3-11-5-1
- Cycle 3: 10-13-5-11-10
- Cycle 4: 14-1-3-11-14
- Cycle 5: 6-4-10-5-6
- Cycle 6: 0-11-3-9-0
- Cycle 7: 2-4-10-13-2
- Cycle 8: 12-13-10-5-12
- Cycle 9: 9-13-10-2-9
- Cycle 10: 14-1-7-6-14

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a single chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 2 has a single chord (3, 11)
- Cycle 3 has a single chord (13, 5)
- Cycle 4 has a single chord (3, 11)
- Cycle 5 has a single chord (4, 10)
- Cycle 6 has a single chord (11, 3)
- Cycle 7 has a single chord (13, 10)
- Cycle 8 has a single chord (13, 5)
- Cycle 9 has a single chord (2, 10)
- Cycle 10 has a single chord (6, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<4, (1, 6), 7>
<1, (3, 11), 5>
<10, (13, 5), 11>
<14, (3, 11), 1>
<5, (4, 10), 6>
<0, (11, 3), 9>
<2, (13, 10), 4>
<12, (13, 5), 10>
<9, (2, 10), 13>
<14, (6, 7), 1>
