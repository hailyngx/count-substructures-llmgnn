Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 9 - 1 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 9 - 2 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 9 - 8 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 4 - 5 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 6: 0 - 4 - 2 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 7: 0 - 4 - 2 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 8: 0 - 4 - 3 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 9: 0 - 7 - 5 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 10: 0 - 7 - 4 - 2 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (9, 8).
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (5, 7).
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (4, 2).
- Cycle 7 has no chords.
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (4, 3).
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (4, 7).
- Cycle 10 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 9, 8, 1, 0>
- <0, 4, 5, 7, 0>
- <0, 4, 2, 6, 0>
- <0, 4, 3, 8, 0>
- <0, 7, 4, 7, 0>
