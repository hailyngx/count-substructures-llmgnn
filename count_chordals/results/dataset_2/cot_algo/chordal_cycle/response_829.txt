Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 8) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-4-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-11-14-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-12-3-0
- Cycle 4: 1-2-5-13-1
- Cycle 5: 1-4-12-5-1
- Cycle 6: 2-5-13-11-2
- Cycle 7: 5-12-4-3-5
- Cycle 8: 7-6-9-8-7
- Cycle 9: 10-0-3-11-10
- Cycle 10: 10-0-4-12-10
- Cycle 11: 10-14-11-7-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- Cycle 3: 0-4-12-3-0 (Chord: 4-12)
- Cycle 5: 1-4-12-5-1 (Chord: 4-12)
- Cycle 6: 2-5-13-11-2 (Chord: 5-11)
- Cycle 8: 7-6-9-8-7 (Chord: 6-8)
- Cycle 10: 10-0-4-12-10 (Chord: 0-12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, (4, 12), 3>
<1, (4, 12), 5>
<2, (5, 11), 13>
<6, (6, 8), 9>
<10, (0, 12), 4>
