Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 9-5-7-9
- Cycle 2: 9-7-6-9
- Cycle 3: 9-5-2-9
- Cycle 4: 5-2-7-5
- Cycle 5: 5-7-6-5
- Cycle 6: 5-9-4-5
- Cycle 7: 4-9-7-4
- Cycle 8: 4-1-2-4
- Cycle 9: 4-1-3-4
- Cycle 10: 4-8-7-4
- Cycle 11: 4-6-7-4
- Cycle 12: 7-5-2-7
- Cycle 13: 7-2-1-7
- Cycle 14: 7-4-9-7
- Cycle 15: 7-4-1-7
- Cycle 16: 1-4-9-1
- Cycle 17: 1-2-5-1
- Cycle 18: 3-1-4-3
- Cycle 19: 3-8-7-3
- Cycle 20: 3-6-7-3
- Cycle 21: 6-7-4-6
- Cycle 22: 6-4-9-6
- Cycle 23: 6-5-2-6
- Cycle 24: 2-5-9-2
- Cycle 25: 2-7-4-2
- Cycle 26: 2-1-4-2
- Cycle 27: 8-4-1-8
- Cycle 28: 8-4-0-8
- Cycle 29: 8-7-9-8
- Cycle 30: 0-8-4-0
- Cycle 31: 0-9-4-0

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: <9, (5-7), 9>
- Cycle 2: <9, (7-6), 9>
- Cycle 3: <9, (5-2), 9>
- Cycle 4: <5, (2-7), 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, (7-6), 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, (9-4), 5>
- Cycle 7: <4, (9-7), 4>
- Cycle 8: <4, (2-1), 4>
- Cycle 9: <7, (5-2), 7>
- Cycle 10: <7, (4-9), 7>
- Cycle 11: <1, (4-9), 1>
- Cycle 12: <3, (1-4), 3>
- Cycle 13: <3, (8-7), 3>
- Cycle 14: <6, (7-4), 6>
- Cycle 15: <2, (5-9), 2>
- Cycle 16: <8, (4-1), 8>
- Cycle 17: <0, (8-4), 0>

Step 3:
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles is [17].
