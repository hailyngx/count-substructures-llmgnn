Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

    - <5, 9, 3, 11, 24, 4> (Chord: 11-24)
    - <5, 9, 16, 29, 12, 24> (Chord: 16-29)
    - <5, 20, 8, 28, 1, 7> (Chord: 8-28)
    - <9, 3, 11, 24, 4, 19> (Chord: 11-24)
    - <0, 27, 19, 18, 2, 25> (Chord: 19-18)
    - <0, 3, 11, 24, 4, 19> (Chord: 11-24)
    - <0, 8, 28, 11, 26, 7> (Chord: 8-11)
    - <0, 19, 18, 22, 6, 12> (Chord: 18-22)
    - <18, 19, 4, 24, 12, 14> (Chord: 12-24)
    - <10, 17, 21, 13, 28, 1> (Chord: 13-28)
    - <2, 18, 19, 4, 24, 12> (Chord: 18-24)
    - <15, 20, 8, 28, 13, 21> (Chord: 8-28)
    - <11, 3, 0, 8, 28, 1> (Chord: 8-28)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
    
    There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
