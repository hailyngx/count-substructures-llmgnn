Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1-6-9-7-1 (Chord: (6, 7))
2. Cycle 1-6-4-8-1 (Chord: (6, 8))
3. Cycle 1-6-5-3-1 (Chord: (6, 5))
4. Cycle 3-1-6-4-3 (Chord: (1, 4))
5. Cycle 3-1-7-9-3 (Chord: (1, 7))
6. Cycle 3-5-6-4-3 (Chord: (5, 4))
7. Cycle 3-5-2-7-3 (Chord: (5, 7))
8. Cycle 4-6-5-3-4 (Chord: (6, 5))
9. Cycle 4-6-1-7-4 (Chord: (6, 7))
10. Cycle 4-8-1-6-4 (Chord: (8, 6))

Step 2:
From the cycles above, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1, 6, 9, 7> (Chord: (6, 7))
2. <1, 6, 4, 8> (Chord: (6, 8))
3. <1, 6, 5, 3> (Chord: (6, 5))
4. <3, 1, 6, 4> (Chord: (1, 4))
5. <3, 1, 7, 9> (Chord: (1, 7))
6. <3, 5, 6, 4> (Chord: (5, 4))
7. <3, 5, 2, 7> (Chord: (5, 7))
8. <4, 6, 5, 3> (Chord: (6, 5))
9. <4, 6, 1, 7> (Chord: (6, 7))
10. <4, 8, 1, 6> (Chord: (8, 6))

Step 3:
There are a total of 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, so the final answer is [10].
