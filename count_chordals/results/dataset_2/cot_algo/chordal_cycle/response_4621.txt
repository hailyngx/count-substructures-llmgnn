- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 27, 17, 26, 19, 2> (Chord: (17, 26))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, 29, 2, 19, 26, 3> (Chord: (2, 26))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 25, 21, 17, 26, 3> (Chord: (21, 26))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 27, 5, 23, 29, 2> (Chord: (5, 29))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, 25, 21, 17, 27, 1> (Chord: (17, 27))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found: [6]
