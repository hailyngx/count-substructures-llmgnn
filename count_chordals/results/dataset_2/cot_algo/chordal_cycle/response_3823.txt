Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more are: 
  - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 1, 5)
  - Cycle 2: (3, 7, 4, 1, 3)
  - Cycle 3: (1, 6, 3, 7, 1)
  - Cycle 4: (8, 6, 1, 4, 8)
  - Cycle 5: (2, 7, 4, 8, 2)
  - Cycle 6: (0, 1, 4, 8, 0)
  - Cycle 7: (5, 8, 4, 9, 5)
  - Cycle 8: (5, 3, 7, 2, 5)

Step 2:
- Among these cycles, only Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 1, 5) has a chord (5, 1) connecting non-adjacent nodes 5 and 1.

Step 3:
- Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (5, 1), 9>
