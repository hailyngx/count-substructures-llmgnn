Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
  - (4, 7, 9, 3)
  - (4, 7, 6, 11)
  - (4, 9, 3, 2)
  - (7, 9, 3, 2)
  - (7, 9, 14, 12)
  - (1, 3, 9, 4)
  - (1, 3, 2, 4)
  - (1, 3, 14, 9)
  - (1, 11, 6, 4)
  - (3, 9, 14, 12)
  - (6, 7, 9, 3)
  - (9, 3, 2, 4)
  - (9, 3, 14, 12)
  - (9, 14, 12, 3)
  - (2, 3, 1, 4)
  - (2, 3, 9, 4)
  - (2, 3, 14, 9)
  - (2, 5, 7, 4)
  - (2, 5, 13, 7)
  - (2, 10, 1, 4)
  - (10, 1, 3, 9)
  - (10, 2, 5, 13)
  - (11, 6, 7, 4)
  - (13, 7, 4, 9)
  - (13, 2, 3, 9)
  - (13, 5, 2, 4)
  - (0, 13, 7, 4)
  - (0, 13, 5, 2)
  
Step 2:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
  - <1, (3, 9), 4>
  - <1, (3, 2), 4>
  - <1, (3, 14), 9>
  - <2, (5, 13), 7>
  
Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have found 4 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the answer is [4].
