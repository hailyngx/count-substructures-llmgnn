Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 1-3-4-8-1
        - Cycle 2: 1-3-9-2-1
        - Cycle 3: 1-13-2-11-1
        - Cycle 4: 1-13-5-8-1
        - Cycle 5: 3-9-2-13-3
        - Cycle 6: 3-9-2-11-3
        - Cycle 7: 3-9-4-10-3
        - Cycle 8: 3-9-4-7-3
        - Cycle 9: 3-9-7-14-3
        - Cycle 10: 3-9-7-11-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 have exactly one chord (4-5).
        - Cycle 2 and Cycle 6 have exactly one chord (3-11).
        - Cycle 3 and Cycle 9 have exactly one chord (1-14).
        - Cycle 5 and Cycle 10 have exactly one chord (2-9).
        - Cycle 8 has exactly one chord (7-10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
        After eliminating duplicate chordal 4-cycles, we find a total of [5] unique chordal 4-cycles. 

        The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        <1, (4-8), 1)>
        <1, (3-11), 2)>
        <1, (1-14), 3)>
        <1, (2-9), 5)>
        <3, (7-10), 8)>
