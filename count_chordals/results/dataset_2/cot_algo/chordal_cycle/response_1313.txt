Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 

List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle: 0-7-1-4-0
- Cycle: 0-1-9-4-0
- Cycle: 1-9-3-6-1
- Cycle: 4-9-7-5-4

Step 2:

Cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle: 0-7-1-4-0 -> Chord: (7, 1)
  <0, (1, 7), 4>

- Cycle: 0-1-9-4-0 -> Chord: (1, 9)
  <0, (1, 9), 4>

- Cycle: 1-9-3-6-1 -> Chord: (9, 3)
  <1, (3, 9), 6>

- Cycle: 4-9-7-5-4 -> Chord: (9, 7)
  <4, (7, 9), 5>

Step 3:

Count of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
