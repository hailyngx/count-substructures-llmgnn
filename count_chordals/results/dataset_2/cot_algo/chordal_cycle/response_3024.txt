Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph. To list all cycles of length 4 or more:

1. Cycle: 4-7-6-4 
2. Cycle: 4-7-9-4 
3. Cycle: 4-7-5-4 
4. Cycle: 4-7-2-4 
5. Cycle: 4-2-8-4 
6. Cycle: 4-2-6-4 
7. Cycle: 4-2-3-4 
8. Cycle: 4-6-1-4 
9. Cycle: 4-6-7-4 
10. Cycle: 4-6-2-4 
11. Cycle: 4-6-3-4 
12. Cycle: 4-6-5-4 

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, 7, 6, 4> has one chord: (4, 6)
- <4, 7, 9, 4> has one chord: (4, 9)
- <4, 7, 5, 4> has one chord: (4, 5)
- <4, 7, 2, 4> has one chord: (4, 2)
- <4, 2, 8, 4> has one chord: (4, 8)
- <4, 2, 6, 4> has one chord: (4, 6)
- <4, 2, 3, 4> has one chord: (4, 3)
- <4, 6, 1, 4> has one chord: (4, 1)
- <4, 6, 7, 4> has one chord: (4, 7)
- <4, 6, 2, 4> has one chord: (4, 2)
- <4, 6, 3, 4> has one chord: (4, 3)
- <4, 6, 5, 4> has one chord: (4, 5)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 12 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
