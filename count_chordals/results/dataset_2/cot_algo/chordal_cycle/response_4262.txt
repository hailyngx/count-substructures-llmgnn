Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 17) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 9) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 15) (0, 12) (0, 9) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 1) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 6) (15, 11) (15, 5) (16, 18) (16, 3) (8, 6) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 10) (17, 18) (17, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 9) (14, 12) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 17) (9, 1) (2, 7) (2, 19) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (4, 18, 16, 3, 4)
- Cycle 2: (11, 1, 4, 9, 11)
- Cycle 3: (7, 11, 3, 16, 18, 6, 19, 7)
- Cycle 4: (11, 3, 16, 18, 6, 19, 7, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1: This cycle has a chord (3, 16).
- Cycle 2: This cycle has a chord (1, 9).
- Cycle 3: This cycle has a chord (11, 16).
- Cycle 4: This cycle has a chord (3, 18).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (3, 16), 4, 9, 11)>
- <3, (1, 9), 3, 16, 18, 6, 19, 7>
- <4, (11, 16), 6, 18, 7, 1, 3>
