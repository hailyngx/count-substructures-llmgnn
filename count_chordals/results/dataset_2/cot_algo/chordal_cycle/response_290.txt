Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- (4, 7, 3, 5, 4)
- (4, 6, 7, 9, 4)
- (7, 3, 9, 1, 7)
- (7, 6, 5, 2, 7)
- (6, 4, 8, 2, 6)
- (9, 1, 7, 4, 9)
- (8, 4, 2, 5, 8)
- (5, 3, 7, 6, 5)
- (2, 4, 6, 0, 2)
- (0, 6, 5, 2, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, (7, 3), 5, 4> - chord: (7, 3)
- <4, (6, 7), 9, 4> - chord: (6, 7)
- <7, (3, 9), 1, 7> - chord: (3, 9)
- <7, (6, 5), 2, 7> - chord: (6, 5)
- <6, (4, 8), 2, 6> - chord: (4, 8)
- <9, (1, 7), 4, 9> - chord: (1, 7)
- <8, (4, 2), 5, 8> - chord: (4, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [7].
