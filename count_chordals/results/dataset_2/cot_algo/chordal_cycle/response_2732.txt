Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 1, 3, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 3, 1, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 10, 12, 5, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 10, 5, 12, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 1, 6, 4, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 3, 1, 6, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 3, 8, 1, 7)
- Cycle 8: (7, 9, 0, 5, 7)
- Cycle 9: (1, 7, 9, 0, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 3, 8, 2, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 6, 11, 2, 1)
- Cycle 12: (4, 6, 11, 2, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 3, 8, 2, 4)
- Cycle 14: (10, 12, 5, 0, 10)
- Cycle 15: (10, 5, 0, 14, 10)
- Cycle 16: (10, 5, 13, 3, 10)
- Cycle 17: (10, 12, 1, 7, 10)
- Cycle 18: (7, 3, 13, 5, 7)
- Cycle 19: (7, 0, 14, 2, 7)
- Cycle 20: (1, 12, 10, 4, 1)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle.
- Only Cycle 20 (<4, 1, 10, 12>) has exactly one chord (2, 7).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
