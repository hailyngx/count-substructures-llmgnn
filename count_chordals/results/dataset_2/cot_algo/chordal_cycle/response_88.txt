Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 0) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 14) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 16) (13, 17) (4, 6) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (7, 6) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 15) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 19) (11, 2) (11, 19) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 3) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 16) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 16) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 19) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (6, 17, 14, 5, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 17, 13, 3, 2, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 4, 12, 1, 8, 2, 3, 9, 6)
- Cycle 4: (14, 5, 0, 17, 13, 3, 2, 8, 12, 18, 16, 15, 14)
- Cycle 5: (17, 0, 5, 14, 15, 16, 18, 12, 4, 6, 7, 17)
- Cycle 6: (2, 3, 8, 0, 5, 15, 16, 18, 12, 4, 6, 17, 13, 2)
- Cycle 7: (8, 1, 12, 18, 16, 15, 14, 5, 0, 17, 6, 7, 4, 12)
- Cycle 8: (3, 19, 11, 2, 8, 0, 5, 14, 17, 13, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, (17, 14), 5, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, (17, 13), 2, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, (5, 14), 17, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <14, (5, 0), 17, 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
