Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 0) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) (19, 7) (19, 12) (15, 6) (16, 13) (16, 17) (12, 4) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 18) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 8) (7, 19) (17, 16) (17, 2) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 12) (18, 6) (18, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 0, 10, 8, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 9, 4, 8, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 3, 2, 12, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 3, 2, 13, 8, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 5, 3, 2, 13, 16, 17, 2, 12, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 5, 3, 2, 14, 18, 12, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 5, 3, 2, 17, 16, 13, 8, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 8, 13, 16, 17, 2, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 8, 4, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 8, 4, 12, 18, 14, 2, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 8, 4, 6, 15, 6, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 8, 4, 6, 1)
- Cycle 13: (1, 8, 4, 6, 18, 12, 2, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 14: (1, 8, 7, 19, 12, 2, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 15: (1, 11, 0, 10, 8, 1)
- Cycle 16: (1, 11, 0, 4, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 17: (1, 11, 0, 5, 1)
- Cycle 18: (1, 6, 4, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 19: (1, 6, 4, 8, 1)
- Cycle 20: (1, 6, 15, 6, 1)
- Cycle 21: (1, 6, 15, 6, 18, 14, 2, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 22: (1, 6, 18, 12, 2, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 23: (1, 6, 18, 14, 2, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 24: (1, 6, 18, 14, 2, 17, 16, 13, 8, 1)
- Cycle 25: (1, 6, 18, 12, 19, 7, 8, 1)
- Cycle 26: (1, 6, 18, 12, 19, 7, 8, 13, 16, 17, 2, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 27: (1, 8, 13, 16, 17, 2, 12, 1)
- Cycle 28: (1, 8, 13, 16, 17, 2, 3, 5, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (5, 9), 4, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (5, 3), 2, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (5, 3), 2, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (5, 3), 2, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 8, (13, 16), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, 11, (0, 10), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, 6, (4, 9), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, 6, (15, 6), 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <1, 8, (7, 19), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <1, 6, (18, 14), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [28].
