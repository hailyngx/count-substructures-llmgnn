Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-7-5
- Cycle 2: 7-9-6-2-7
- Cycle 3: 3-9-7-1-3
- Cycle 4: 8-5-2-1-8
- Cycle 5: 0-5-9-6-0
- Cycle 6: 9-3-7-4-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 <9, (4, 7), 5>
- Cycle 2 <7, (6, 2), 9>
- Cycle 3 <3, (7, 1), 9>
- Cycle 4 <2, (1, 8), 5>
- Cycle 5 <5, (0, 9), 8>
- Cycle 6 <9, (7, 4), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [0]
