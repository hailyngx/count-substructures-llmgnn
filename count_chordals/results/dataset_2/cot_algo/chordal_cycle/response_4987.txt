Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 17) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 10) (0, 27) (0, 12) (0, 1) (3, 25) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 4) (25, 21) (6, 9) (6, 21) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 12) (10, 27) (10, 12) (10, 23) (17, 15) (17, 21) (17, 7) (28, 14) (28, 19) (29, 19) (22, 9) (22, 14) (26, 13) (26, 11) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 18) (21, 25) (21, 6) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 24) (20, 3) (20, 8) (8, 21) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 24) (19, 28) (19, 29) (19, 8) (19, 18) (18, 15) (18, 13) (18, 19) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 11) (5, 2) (14, 3) (14, 28) (14, 22) (14, 7) (24, 21) (24, 8) (24, 7) (24, 23) (1, 0) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 24) (16, 23) (16, 4) (4, 25) (4, 16) (4, 23) (4, 11) (23, 10) (23, 24) (23, 16) (23, 4) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 4) 

Response:
Step 1:  
- Start listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- (0, 27, 15, 17)  
- (27, 15, 17, 21)  
- (15, 17, 21, 6)  
- (17, 21, 6, 9)  
- (21, 6, 9, 22)  
- (6, 9, 22, 14)  
- (9, 22, 14, 28)  
- (22, 14, 28, 19)  
- (14, 28, 19, 8)  
- (28, 19, 8, 24)  
- (19, 8, 24, 21)  
- (8, 24, 21, 17)  
- (24, 21, 17, 7)  
- (21, 17, 7, 14)  
- (17, 7, 14, 3)  
- (7, 14, 3, 25)  
- (14, 3, 25, 4)  
- (3, 25, 4, 16)  
- (25, 4, 16, 23)  
- (4, 16, 23, 10)  
- (16, 23, 10, 27)  
- (23, 10, 27, 0)  
- (10, 27, 0, 1)  
- (27, 0, 1, 12)  
- (0, 1, 12, 13)  
- (1, 12, 13, 18)  
- (12, 13, 18, 15)  
- (13, 18, 15, 27)  
- (18, 15, 27, 10)  
- (15, 27, 10, 23)  
- (27, 10, 23, 24)  
- (13, 12, 0, 1)  

Step 2:  
- The cycle (13, 12, 0, 1) has exactly one chord: (0, 1).  

Step 3:  
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]  

Unique chordal 4-cycle:  
- <13, 12, 0, 1>
