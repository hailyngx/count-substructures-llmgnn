Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 24) (5, 9) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 23) (15, 0) (15, 17) (15, 16) (27, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (14, 13) (14, 17) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 11) (1, 13) (1, 27) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 29) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 25) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 0) (21, 4) (21, 28) (21, 25) (28, 5) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 7) (19, 4) (19, 26) (19, 29) (26, 13) (26, 19) (26, 10) (26, 11) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 29) (20, 17) (16, 15) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 24) (0, 15) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 28) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 29) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 10) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 18) (23, 9) (23, 2) (23, 29) (24, 22) (24, 16) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 11) (29, 12) (29, 23) (25, 4) (25, 21) (2, 6) (2, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 3, 1, 13> 
- <0, 3, 11, 26> 
- <0, 8, 4, 19> 
- <0, 15, 16, 28> 
- <3, 1, 13, 22> 
- <3, 11, 17, 20> 
- <4, 8, 0, 15> 
- <4, 19, 26, 13> 
- <4, 21, 28, 5> 
- <4, 25, 21, 28> 
- <5, 28, 21, 4> 
- <6, 9, 5, 28> 
- <6, 9, 23, 29> 
- <6, 18, 10, 26> 
- <6, 12, 16, 15> 
- <9, 5, 28, 21> 
- <9, 6, 18, 10> 
- <10, 22, 24, 16> 
- <11, 17, 14, 13> 
- <11, 26, 19, 4> 
- <11, 29, 12, 16> 
- <12, 6, 9, 5> 
- <12, 16, 15, 0> 
- <12, 29, 23, 9> 
- <13, 1, 27, 26>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 3, 1, 13> has chord (3, 1)
- <0, 8, 4, 19> has chord (8, 4)
- <0, 15, 16, 28> has chord (15, 16)
- <4, 8, 0, 15> has chord (8, 15)
- <4, 25, 21, 28> has chord (25, 21)
- <6, 9, 23, 29> has chord (9, 23)
- <6, 18, 10, 26> has chord (18, 10)
- <11, 29, 12, 16> has chord (29, 12)
- <13, 1, 27, 26> has chord (1, 27)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].
