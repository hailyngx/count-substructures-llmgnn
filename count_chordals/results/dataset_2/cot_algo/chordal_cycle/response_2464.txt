Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 9 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 0 - 5 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 0 - 6 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 4 - 7 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 4 - 8 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 2 - 8 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 7: 2 - 1 - 8 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 8: 2 - 1 - 4 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 9: 2 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 10: 3 - 1 - 0 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 11: 3 - 1 - 4 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 12: 3 - 0 - 5 - 4 - 3
- Cycle 13: 3 - 4 - 7 - 6 - 3
- Cycle 14: 3 - 4 - 9 - 2 - 3
- Cycle 15: 3 - 7 - 9 - 2 - 3
- Cycle 16: 4 - 1 - 0 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 17: 4 - 1 - 8 - 2 - 4
- Cycle 18: 4 - 1 - 2 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 19: 4 - 7 - 3 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 20: 4 - 7 - 9 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 21: 4 - 8 - 2 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 22: 5 - 0 - 1 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 23: 6 - 0 - 1 - 4 - 6
- Cycle 24: 7 - 4 - 8 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 25: 7 - 6 - 2 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 26: 8 - 4 - 1 - 2 - 8
- Cycle 27: 9 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, 4, 8, 2> has one chord: (1, 8)
- <4, 1, 2, 6> has one chord: (1, 2)
- <4, 7, 3, 1> has one chord: (4, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 24 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [24].
