Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (8, 11) (8, 12) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 2, 9, 5, 4)
- Cycle 3: (7, 14, 0, 3, 1, 7)
- Cycle 4: (0, 11, 2, 7, 5, 0)
- Cycle 5: (12, 8, 11, 0, 14, 12)
- Cycle 6: (13, 6, 4, 7, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 3, 4, 5) has no chords
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 2, 9, 5, 4) has a chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 3: (7, 14, 0, 3, 1, 7) has no chords
- Cycle 4: (0, 11, 2, 7, 5, 0) has no chords
- Cycle 5: (12, 8, 11, 0, 14, 12) has no chords
- Cycle 6: (13, 6, 4, 7, 13) has a chord (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 3 chordless cycles: Cycle 1, Cycle 3, and Cycle 4

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
- <1, (7, 9), 3, 4, 5>
- <3, 0, 1, 7, 14>
- <5, 9, 2, 7, 0>
