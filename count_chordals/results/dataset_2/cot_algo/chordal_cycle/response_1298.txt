Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-6-9-1-5
- Cycle 2: 6-8-3-4-6
- Cycle 3: 0-2-4-1-0
- Cycle 4: 0-7-2-1-0

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the listed cycles:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has a chord <2, 4>.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, (2, 4), 1>
