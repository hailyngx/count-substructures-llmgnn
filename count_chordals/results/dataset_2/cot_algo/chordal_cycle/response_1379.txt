Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-0-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-6-3-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-6-7-5
- Cycle 4: 5-9-2-6-5
- Cycle 5: 5-9-8-4-5
- Cycle 6: 5-9-8-7-5
- Cycle 7: 5-9-8-1-5
- Cycle 8: 5-9-1-4-5
- Cycle 9: 5-9-1-7-5
- Cycle 10: 5-9-1-8-5
- Cycle 11: 9-6-0-2-9
- Cycle 12: 9-6-0-7-9
- Cycle 13: 9-6-3-4-9
- Cycle 14: 9-6-3-7-9
- Cycle 15: 9-6-2-0-9
- Cycle 16: 9-6-2-7-9
- Cycle 17: 9-6-7-3-9
- Cycle 18: 9-6-7-2-9
- Cycle 19: 9-8-4-3-9
- Cycle 20: 9-8-4-1-9
- Cycle 21: 9-8-4-5-9
- Cycle 22: 9-8-7-3-9
- Cycle 23: 9-8-7-2-9
- Cycle 24: 9-8-7-1-9
- Cycle 25: 9-8-1-4-9
- Cycle 26: 9-8-1-7-9
- Cycle 27: 9-8-1-5-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 7 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (9, 8)
- Cycle 24 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 25 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (9, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is 6.
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <5, 9, 6, 0>
- <5, 9, 6, 3>
- <5, 9, 6, 7>
- <5, 9, 2, 6>
- <5, 9, 8, 4>
- <5, 9, 8, 7>
