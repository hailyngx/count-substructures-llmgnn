Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-12-7-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-2-3-1-5
        - Cycle 3: 5-14-0-1-5
        - Cycle 4: 5-13-0-14-5
        - Cycle 5: 9-11-2-5-9
        - Cycle 6: 9-14-7-12-9
        - Cycle 7: 4-7-8-6-4
        - Cycle 8: 4-10-1-7-4
        - Cycle 9: 7-1-0-14-7
        - Cycle 10: 12-9-14-0-12
        - Cycle 11: 2-3-12-9-2
        - Cycle 12: 2-13-0-14-2
        - Cycle 13: 2-11-6-8-2
        - Cycle 14: 8-6-11-0-8
        - Cycle 15: 0-1-10-3-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5-9-12-7-5 has a unique chord (9, 7).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5-2-3-1-5 has a unique chord (2, 1).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5-14-0-1-5 has a unique chord (14, 1).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5-13-0-14-5 has a unique chord (13, 14).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9-11-2-5-9 has a unique chord (11, 5).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9-14-7-12-9 has a unique chord (14, 7).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4-7-8-6-4 has a unique chord (7, 8).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4-10-1-7-4 has a unique chord (10, 7).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7-1-0-14-7 has a unique chord (1, 14).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12-9-14-0-12 has a unique chord (9, 14).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2-3-12-9-2 has a unique chord (3, 9).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2-13-0-14-2 has a unique chord (13, 14).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2-11-6-8-2 has a unique chord (11, 6).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8-6-11-0-8 has a unique chord (6, 11).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 0-1-10-3-0 has a unique chord (1, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [15].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        <5, (9, 7)>
        <5, (2, 1)>
        <5, (14, 1)>
        <5, (13, 14)>
        <9, (11, 5)>
        <9, (14, 7)>
        <4, (7, 8)>
        <4, (10, 7)>
        <7, (1, 14)>
        <12, (9, 14)>
        <2, (3, 9)>
        <2, (13, 14)>
        <2, (11, 6)>
        <8, (6, 11)>
        <0, (1, 10)>
