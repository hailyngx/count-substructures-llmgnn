Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 26) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 5) (18, 4) (18, 5) (22, 5) (22, 29) (12, 27) (12, 8) (12, 26) (7, 24) (7, 1) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 25) (17, 6) (17, 23) (29, 22) (29, 16) (29, 26) (11, 21) (28, 3) (28, 25) (5, 27) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 13) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 6) (1, 7) (1, 16) (1, 24) (1, 8) (15, 5) (15, 16) (8, 12) (8, 1) (19, 25) (19, 10) (2, 27) (2, 9) (2, 6) (3, 27) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 10) (14, 9) (6, 0) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 2) (24, 7) (24, 1) (24, 3) (24, 23) (20, 26) (26, 0) (26, 12) (26, 29) (26, 20) (21, 0) (21, 11) (21, 23) (9, 2) (9, 14) (25, 4) (25, 28) (25, 13) (25, 19) (16, 4) (16, 29) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 10) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 3) (10, 16) (23, 17) (23, 24) (23, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (0, 27, 12, 8, 1, 7, 24, 3)
- Cycle 2: (0, 27, 12, 8, 1, 16, 29, 22)
- Cycle 3: (0, 27, 12, 26, 29, 22, 5, 18)
- Cycle 4: (0, 27, 2, 6, 17, 23, 24, 7)
- Cycle 5: (27, 3, 10, 19, 25, 13, 6, 17)
- Cycle 6: (27, 3, 10, 19, 25, 4, 18, 5)
- Cycle 7: (27, 12, 26, 29, 16, 1, 7, 24)
- Cycle 8: (27, 12, 26, 29, 16, 1, 8, 12)
- Cycle 9: (27, 5, 13, 25, 28, 3, 24, 7)
- Cycle 10: (27, 5, 13, 25, 19, 10, 3, 24)
- Cycle 11: (27, 5, 22, 29, 26, 0, 6, 17)
- Cycle 12: (27, 5, 22, 29, 26, 20, 26, 12)
- Cycle 13: (18, 5, 13, 25, 19, 10, 16, 4)
- Cycle 14: (22, 29, 16, 1, 8, 12, 26, 20)
- Cycle 15: (4, 25, 13, 6, 2, 27, 5, 22)
- Cycle 16: (4, 25, 13, 6, 2, 27, 12, 26)
- Cycle 17: (17, 6, 13, 25, 28, 3, 24, 23)
- Cycle 18: (29, 26, 20, 26, 0, 27, 12, 8)
- Cycle 19: (29, 26, 20, 26, 12, 8, 1, 16)
- Cycle 20: (1, 24, 23, 17, 6, 2, 27, 0)
- Cycle 21: (8, 12, 26, 20, 26, 29, 16, 1)
- Cycle 22: (26, 29, 22, 5, 18, 4, 25, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, (12, 8), 27>
- <2, (1, 16), 27>
- <3, (5, 18), 27>
- <4, (24, 7), 27>
- <5, (17, 23), 6>
- <6, (4, 18), 25>
- <7, (1, 7), 27>
- <8, (1, 8), 26>
- <9, (24, 7), 27>
- <10, (24, 3), 27>
- <11, (20, 26), 27>
- <12, (20, 26), 27>
- <13, (4, 25), 13>
- <14, (1, 16), 29>
- <15, (5, 22), 29>
- <16, (6, 16), 27>
- <17, (6, 16), 27>
- <18, (24, 23), 17>
- <19, (26, 20), 29>
- <20, (1, 16), 29>
- <21, (27, 0), 12>
- <22, (29, 22), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 22 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [22].
