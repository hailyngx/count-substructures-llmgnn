Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (1, 5, 2, 6, 1)
- (1, 5, 2, 9, 0, 1)
- (1, 5, 2, 6, 7, 4, 1)
- (1, 6, 5, 2, 9, 3, 6)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, 5, 2, 6, 1> with chord (2, 6)
- <1, 5, 2, 9, 0, 1> with chord (5, 2)
- <1, 6, 5, 2, 9, 3, 6> with chord (2, 9)

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, 5, 2, 6, 1> with chord (2, 6)
- <1, 5, 2, 9, 0, 1> with chord (5, 2)
- <1, 6, 5, 2, 9, 3, 6> with chord (2, 9)
