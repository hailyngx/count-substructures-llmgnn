Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (10, 13) (10, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 8, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 13, 14, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 14, 13, 8, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 2, 12, 6, 4, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 3, 14, 13, 5, 9)
- Cycle 6: (8, 3, 0, 4, 6, 8)
- Cycle 7: (8, 1, 9, 2, 12, 8)
- Cycle 8: (13, 10, 4, 6, 12, 13)
- Cycle 9: (13, 7, 5, 9, 2, 13)
- Cycle 10: (4, 0, 12, 11, 8, 4)
- Cycle 11: (2, 9, 5, 7, 14, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 8, 11, 0, 6, 2)
- Cycle 13: (1, 9, 5, 7, 14, 1)
- Cycle 14: (6, 4, 10, 13, 14, 6)
- Cycle 15: (12, 6, 0, 11, 8, 12)
- Cycle 16: (11, 8, 3, 5, 7, 11)
- Cycle 17: (14, 1, 9, 5, 3, 14)
- Cycle 18: (0, 4, 10, 13, 5, 0)

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 8)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (13, 9)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (13, 8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (2, 6)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (3, 14)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (3, 0)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (1, 12)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (13, 6)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (5, 2)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (12, 8)
- Cycle 11 has a chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 12 has a chord (8, 6)
- Cycle 13 has a chord (5, 14)
- Cycle 14 has a chord (13, 10)
- Cycle 15 has a chord (6, 0)
- Cycle 16 has a chord (8, 7)
- Cycle 17 has a chord (9, 3)
- Cycle 18 has a chord (4, 13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 18 cycles with exactly one chord. Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [18].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (12, 6), 2, 8, 13>
- <2, (9, 6), 12, 4, 0>
- <3, (14, 0), 5, 9, 13>
- <4, (13, 10), 6, 12, 0>
- <5, (9, 8), 3, 14, 13>
- <6, (12, 0), 4, 10, 13>
- <7, (9, 2), 5, 13, 8>
- <8, (13, 8), 5, 7, 14>
- <9, (4, 13), 10, 14, 1>
- <10, (13, 9), 5, 7, 14>
- <11, (8, 4), 10, 13, 14>
- <12, (1, 8), 9, 2, 12>
- <13, (13, 14), 1, 9, 5>
- <14, (5, 1), 9, 2, 8>
- <15, (9, 7), 5, 3, 14>
- <16, (13, 6), 2, 8, 3>
- <17, (3, 14), 5, 9, 2>
- <18, (9, 3), 14, 1, 5>
