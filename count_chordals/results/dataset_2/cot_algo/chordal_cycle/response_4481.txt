Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-8-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-9-4-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-6-8-1
- Cycle 4: 3-1-4-8-3
- Cycle 5: 3-9-4-6-3
- Cycle 6: 4-6-8-5-4
- Cycle 7: 4-1-3-2-4
- Cycle 8: 4-8-2-7-4
- Cycle 9: 8-5-1-7-8
- Cycle 10: 8-6-4-2-8

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has chord <8, (5, 1)>.
- Cycle 7 has chord <4, (3, 2)>.
- Cycle 8 has chord <8, (7, 2)>.
- Cycle 9 has no chord.
- Cycle 10 has no chord.

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<6, (8, 5), 1)>
<7, (4, 3), 2)>
<8, (8, 7), 2)>
