Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (11, 2) (11, 5) 

Response:
There are [12] chordal 4-cycles in this graph. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<9, (0, 3), 13)>
<9, (1, 10), 7)>
<7, (12, 5), 2)>
<7, (12, 14), 5)>
<7, (2, 11), 5)>
<5, (8, 14), 12)>
<5, (8, 14), 3)>
<5, (11, 12), 2)>
<5, (11, 2), 7)>
<3, (0, 13), 6)>
<3, (10, 1), 9)>
<13, (0, 4), 5)>
