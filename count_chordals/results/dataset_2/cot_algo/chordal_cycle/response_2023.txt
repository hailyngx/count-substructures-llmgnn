The edges are as follows: (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 23) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 23) (2, 9) (2, 22) (29, 28) (29, 6) (29, 3) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 20) (21, 8) (0, 21) (0, 22) (0, 25) (27, 25) (27, 14) (27, 5) (8, 7) (8, 21) (8, 3) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 19) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 5) (28, 29) (28, 12) (28, 13) (28, 15) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 26) (18, 4) (19, 26) (19, 23) (19, 24) (19, 13) (15, 28) (20, 21) (20, 24) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 19) (11, 6) (16, 9) (16, 10) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 5) (1, 4) (1, 25) (1, 5) (1, 24) (6, 29) (6, 11) (12, 28) (25, 0) (25, 27) (25, 1) (25, 14) (3, 29) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 24) (24, 19) (24, 20) (24, 1) (24, 3) (14, 7) (14, 27) (14, 25) (14, 5) (5, 27) (5, 17) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (9, 2, 22, 0, 21, 8, 7, 3, 10)
- Cycle 2: (9, 23, 26, 18, 4, 1, 25, 0, 21)
- Cycle 3: (10, 3, 7, 8, 21, 0, 22, 2, 9)
- Cycle 4: (10, 3, 24, 1, 25, 27, 14, 7, 8)
- Cycle 5: (10, 16, 9, 23, 26, 18, 4, 1)
- Cycle 6: (11, 6, 29, 28, 13, 26, 23, 19)
- Cycle 7: (11, 6, 29, 3, 7, 8, 21, 13)
- Cycle 8: (12, 28, 29, 6, 11, 7, 3, 10)
- Cycle 9: (15, 28, 29, 6, 11, 7, 3, 10)
- Cycle 10: (17, 10, 3, 7, 8, 21, 13, 26)
- Cycle 11: (17, 5, 27, 14, 7, 3, 10, 16)
- Cycle 12: (19, 23, 9, 2, 22, 0, 25, 1)
- Cycle 13: (19, 26, 18, 4, 1, 24, 3, 10)
- Cycle 14: (19, 24, 1, 4, 18, 26, 13, 21)
- Cycle 15: (20, 24, 1, 4, 18, 26, 13, 21)
- Cycle 16: (21, 8, 7, 3, 24, 20, 19, 26)
- Cycle 17: (22, 0, 25, 1, 4, 18, 26, 13)
- Cycle 18: (25, 1, 4, 18, 26, 23, 19, 24)
- Cycle 19: (27, 25, 0, 21, 13, 26, 23, 19)
- Cycle 20: (28, 29, 6, 11, 7, 3, 24, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (9, 2), 22, 0, 21, 8, 7, 3> (Chord: (9, 2))
- <2, (9, 23), 26, 18, 4, 1, 25, 0> (Chord: (9, 23))
- <3, 10, (10, 3), 7, 8, 21, 0, 22> (Chord: (10, 3))
- <4, 3, (10, 16), 9, 23, 26, 18, 4> (Chord: (10, 16))
- <5, 6, 11, (11, 6), 29, 28, 13, 26> (Chord: (11, 6))
- <7, 8, 15, 28, 29, (29, 28), 6, 11> (Chord: (28, 29))
- <9, 5, 17, (17, 10), 3, 7, 8, 21> (Chord: (17, 10))
- <12, 13, (19, 23), 9, 2, 22, 0, 25> (Chord: (19, 23))
- <14, 16, 20, (19, 26), 18, 4, 1, 24> (Chord: (19, 26))
- <18, 17, 22, 27, (25, 1), 4, 18, 26> (Chord: (25, 1))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [9]
