Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 10, 5)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 7, 14, 6, 4)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 13, 4, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 9, 11, 7, 14, 6, 12, 0, 3, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 9, 11, 2, 3, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 3, 0, 12, 13, 4, 10, 5, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 3, 2, 13, 10, 2, 11, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 9: (3, 13, 2, 11, 0, 12, 6, 14, 7, 8, 4, 3)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (10, 4)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (7, 14)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (13, 4)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (7, 14)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (11, 9)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (5, 1)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (13, 4)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found.

Thus, the final count of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
