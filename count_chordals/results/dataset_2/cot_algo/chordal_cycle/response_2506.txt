Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <1, 3, 4, 6>
- <1, 3, 9, 10>
- <1, 10, 13, 8>
- <1, 10, 14, 5>
- <3, 4, 6, 2>
- <3, 4, 9, 10>
- <3, 6, 14, 5>
- <4, 6, 3, 9>
- <8, 11, 12, 5>
- <8, 11, 13, 10>
- <11, 1, 10, 13>
- <11, 1, 14, 5>
- <11, 8, 13, 10>
- <11, 12, 5, 14>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph with exactly one chord are:
- <1, 3, 4, 6>, (1, 4)
- <1, 10, 13, 8>, (10, 8)
- <1, 10, 14, 5>, (10, 14)
- <3, 4, 6, 2>, (4, 6)
- <3, 4, 9, 10>, (4, 9)
- <8, 11, 12, 5>, (11, 5)

Step 3:
Since we found 6 unique chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [6].
