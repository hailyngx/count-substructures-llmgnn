Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-5-0-4
- Cycle 2: 4-8-9-1-4
- Cycle 3: 4-2-6-5-4
- Cycle 4: 7-0-1-9-7
- Cycle 5: 7-5-6-9-7
- Cycle 6: 7-1-8-0-7
- Cycle 7: 6-9-8-4-6
- Cycle 8: 6-5-2-3-6
- Cycle 9: 9-8-0-5-9
- Cycle 10: 9-1-7-4-9
- Cycle 11: 8-0-5-6-8
- Cycle 12: 8-1-7-5-8
- Cycle 13: 5-0-7-1-5
- Cycle 14: 5-6-2-4-5
- Cycle 15: 0-1-7-4-0
- Cycle 16: 3-6-5-0-3
- Cycle 17: 2-4-8-1-2

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- <4, (7, 5), 0>
- <4, (8, 9), 1>
- <4, (2, 6), 5>
- <9, (8, 5), 6>
- <8, (1, 7), 0>
- <6, (9, 8), 4>
- <6, (5, 2), 3>
- <9, (0, 5), 8>
- <5, (7, 1), 0>
- <5, (2, 4), 6>
- <0, (1, 7), 4>
- <3, (6, 5), 0>
- <2, (4, 8), 1>

Step 3:
Counting the chordless cycles, we have found 0 unique chordal 4-cycles, denoted by [0].
