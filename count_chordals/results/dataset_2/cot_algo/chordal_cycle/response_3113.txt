Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 14) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <4, 5, 6, 2, 4>
- Cycle 2: <4, 9, 7, 1, 4>
- Cycle 3: <4, 8, 1, 13, 4>
- Cycle 4: <4, 3, 10, 11, 4>
- Cycle 5: <7, 1, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle 6: <7, 11, 10, 0, 7>
- Cycle 7: <8, 13, 2, 7, 8>
- Cycle 8: <8, 14, 5, 4, 8>
- Cycle 9: <13, 1, 7, 11, 13>
- Cycle 10: <13, 8, 4, 9, 13>
- Cycle 11: <10, 11, 7, 9, 10>
- Cycle 12: <10, 0, 12, 5, 10>
- Cycle 13: <5, 14, 8, 4, 5>
- Cycle 14: <5, 6, 2, 12, 5>
- Cycle 15: <6, 2, 13, 1, 6>
- Cycle 16: <0, 10, 11, 7, 0>
- Cycle 17: <0, 12, 5, 14, 0>
- Cycle 18: <0, 2, 13, 1, 0>
- Cycle 19: <11, 3, 4, 9, 11>
- Cycle 20: <11, 0, 10, 3, 11>
- Cycle 21: <12, 0, 10, 3, 12>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <4, 5, 6, 2, 4> has 1 chord <5, 2>
- <4, 9, 7, 1, 4> has 1 chord <9, 1>
- <4, 8, 1, 13, 4> has 1 chord <8, 13>
- <4, 3, 10, 11, 4> has 1 chord <3, 11>
- <7, 1, 9, 4, 7> has 1 chord <1, 9>
- <7, 11, 10, 0, 7> has 1 chord <11, 10>
- <8, 13, 2, 7, 8> has 1 chord <13, 7>
- <8, 14, 5, 4, 8> has 1 chord <14, 4>
- <13, 1, 7, 11, 13> has 1 chord <1, 11>
- <13, 8, 4, 9, 13> has 1 chord <8, 9>
- <10, 11, 7, 9, 10> has 1 chord <11, 9>
- <0, 12, 5, 14, 0> has 1 chord <12, 14>
- <0, 2, 13, 1, 0> has 1 chord <2, 1>
- <11, 0, 10, 3, 11> has 1 chord <0, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [8].
