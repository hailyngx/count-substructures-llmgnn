Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 13, 10>
- <0, 1, 4, 8>
- <0, 1, 6, 5>
- <0, 1, 6, 7>
- <0, 1, 4, 10>
- <0, 1, 6, 11>
- <0, 1, 5, 14>
- <0, 2, 0, 4>
- <0, 2, 0, 7>
- <0, 2, 0, 14>
- <0, 2, 0, 3>
- <0, 2, 0, 1>
- <0, 3, 5, 14>
- <0, 3, 5, 1>
- <0, 3, 5, 6>
- <0, 3, 5, 8>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes) are:
- <0, 1, 4, 8>; Chord: (1, 4)
- <0, 1, 6, 5>; Chord: (1, 6)
- <0, 1, 6, 7>; Chord: (1, 6)
- <0, 1, 4, 10>; Chord: (1, 4)

Step 3:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [4].
