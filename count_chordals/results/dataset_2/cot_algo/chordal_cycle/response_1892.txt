Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 3: (5, 0, 8, 4)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 8, 6)
- Cycle 5: (9, 5, 4, 8)
- Cycle 6: (9, 6, 7, 0)
- Cycle 7: (4, 5, 1, 0)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 0, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 9, 6, 3)
- Cycle 10: (7, 0, 1, 5)
- Cycle 11: (1, 5, 6, 9)
- Cycle 12: (1, 0, 7, 3)
- Cycle 13: (3, 9, 2, 1)
- Cycle 14: (3, 7, 0, 5)
- Cycle 15: (6, 5, 4, 8)
- Cycle 16: (6, 9, 2, 1)
- Cycle 17: (6, 7, 0, 5)
- Cycle 18: (6, 3, 7, 0)
- Cycle 19: (8, 4, 5, 1)
- Cycle 20: (8, 6, 9, 2)
- Cycle 21: (0, 5, 9, 2)
- Cycle 22: (0, 7, 3, 6)
- Cycle 23: (0, 1, 5, 4)
- Cycle 24: (0, 8, 4, 5)
- Cycle 25: (2, 9, 6, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 5: (9, 5, 4, 8) has exactly one chord (5, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [24]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <9, 5, 4, 8>
