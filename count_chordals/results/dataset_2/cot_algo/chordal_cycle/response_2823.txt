Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord):
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (4, 9), 8, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (7, 9), 8, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <7, (6, 1), 4, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, (3, 9), 7, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, (5, 7), 6, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (0, 3), 8, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, (7, 6), 9, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, (1, 4), 7, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (6, 1), 7, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <0, (1, 4), 3, 0>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
