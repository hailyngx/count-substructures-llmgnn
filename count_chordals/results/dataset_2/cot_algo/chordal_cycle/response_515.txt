Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 15) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 16) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 1) (12, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 19) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 14) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 19) (2, 19) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 16) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 2) (10, 4) (18, 0) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
<5, 6, 15, 13>
<5, 6, 15, 16>
<5, 13, 19, 16>
<5, 13, 19, 4>
<5, 13, 19, 2>
<5, 15, 16, 1>
<9, 17, 16, 15>
<6, 15, 16, 17>
<3, 15, 16, 17>
<3, 8, 15, 16>
<3, 17, 16, 1>
<15, 13, 19, 16>
<15, 13, 19, 4>
<15, 13, 19, 2>
<15, 16, 1, 0>
<13, 19, 16, 17>
<13, 19, 16, 1>
<13, 19, 2, 14>
<11, 14, 2, 19>
<14, 2, 19, 4>
<17, 16, 1, 0>
<4, 19, 16, 1>
<1, 16, 17, 12>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
<5, 6, 15, 13> has a chord (6, 15)
<5, 13, 19, 16> has a chord (13, 16)
<9, 17, 16, 15> has a chord (17, 15)
<6, 15, 16, 17> has a chord (15, 16)
<3, 15, 16, 17> has a chord (15, 16)
<15, 13, 19, 16> has a chord (13, 16)
<11, 14, 2, 19> has a chord (14, 2)
<17, 16, 1, 0> has a chord (16, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 21 chordless cycles in total. So, the final count is [21].
