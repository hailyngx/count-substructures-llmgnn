Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-12-6-4
- Cycle 2: 5-6-10-13-5
- Cycle 3: 5-6-1-14-5
- Cycle 4: 5-6-9-8-5
- Cycle 5: 8-9-6-5-8
- Cycle 6: 8-9-0-13-8

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-12-(6)-4 (Chord: 6)
- Cycle 2: 5-6-10-(13)-5 (Chord: 13)
- Cycle 3: 5-6-(1)-14-5 (Chord: 1)
- Cycle 4: 5-6-(9)-8-5 (Chord: 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, 7, 12, 6> (Chord: (4, 12))
- <5, 6, 10, 13> (Chord: (5, 10))
