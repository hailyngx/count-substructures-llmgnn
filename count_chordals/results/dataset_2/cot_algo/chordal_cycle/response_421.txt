Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 24, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 12, 7, 24, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 16, 21, 19, 1, 24, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 16, 21, 18, 1, 24, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 24, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 24, 1, 17, 11, 2, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 24, 1, 10, 0, 27, 22, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 24, 7, 25, 2, 11, 17, 1, 19, 21, 16, 13, 7, 24, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 24, 7, 25, 4, 14, 25, 2, 3, 7, 12, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 24, 7, 25, 4, 14, 4, 25, 2, 5)
- Cycle 11: (5, 24, 27, 0, 10, 22, 27, 24, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 24, 27, 0, 29, 26, 25, 4, 14, 4, 25, 2, 11, 17, 1, 24, 5)

Step 2: Checking for chordal 4-cycles:
- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <6, 24>.
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <12, 7>.
- Cycle 3 is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 4 is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 5 is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 6 is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 7 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <10, 0>.
- Cycle 8 is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 9 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <12, 7>.
- Cycle 10 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <14, 4>.
- Cycle 11 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <10, 22>.
- Cycle 12 is not a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [6] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 9), 6, 24, 5>
- <2, (5, 12), 7, 24, 5>
- <7, (5, 24), 0, 10, 22, 27, 24, 5>
- <9, (5, 24), 4, 14, 25, 2, 12, 5>
- <10, (5, 24), 0, 27, 22, 10, 24, 5>
- <11, (5, 24), 7, 25, 4, 14, 25, 2, 17, 1, 24, 5>
