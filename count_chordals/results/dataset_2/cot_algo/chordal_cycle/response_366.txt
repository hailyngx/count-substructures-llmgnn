Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 4, 2, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 4, 6, 2, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 5, 7, 6, 2, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 9, 0, 1)
- Cycle 8: (2, 4, 5, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 4, 6, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 4, 6, 8, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 5, 4, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 5, 6, 8, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 5, 7, 4, 2)
- Cycle 14: (2, 6, 4, 2)
- Cycle 15: (2, 6, 8, 2)
- Cycle 16: (2, 6, 4, 5, 2)
- Cycle 17: (2, 8, 6, 2)
- Cycle 18: (3, 1, 5, 3)
- Cycle 19: (3, 1, 5, 4, 2, 3)
- Cycle 20: (3, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 3)
- Cycle 21: (3, 5, 7, 4, 2, 3)
- Cycle 22: (3, 5, 4, 2, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (3, 5), 1>
- <1, (5, 4), 2, 1>
- <1, (5, 4), 6, 2, 1>
- <1, (5, 4), 7, 2, 1>
- <1, (5, 7), 4, 2, 1>
- <1, (5, 7), 6, 2, 1>
- <1, (9, 0), 1>
- <2, (4, 5), 2>
- <2, (4, 6), 2>
- <2, (4, 6), 8, 2>
- <2, (5, 4), 2>
- <2, (5, 6), 8, 2>
- <2, (5, 7), 4, 2>
- <2, (6, 4), 2>
- <2, (6, 8), 2>
- <2, (6, 4), 5, 2>
- <2, (8, 6), 2>
- <3, (1, 5), 3>
- <3, (1, 5), 4, 2, 3>
- <3, (1, 5), 7, 4, 2, 3>
- <3, (5, 7), 4, 2, 3>
- <3, (5, 4), 2, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
