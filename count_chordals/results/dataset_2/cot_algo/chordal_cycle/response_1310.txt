Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 28) (1, 4) (1, 9) (21, 13) (2, 22) (2, 7) (29, 27) (29, 11) (0, 27) (0, 24) (0, 19) (27, 29) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 29) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 22) (5, 15) (6, 23) (6, 4) (20, 23) (20, 28) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 9) (22, 2) (22, 11) (25, 16) (25, 4) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 26) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 8) (14, 27) (14, 11) (14, 28) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 9) (13, 21) (13, 19) (13, 12) (13, 28) (7, 2) (7, 24) (7, 8) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 15) (9, 24) (9, 16) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 9) (8, 10) (8, 26) (8, 7) (8, 18) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 14) (28, 13) (16, 25) (16, 26) (16, 9) (3, 27) (3, 26) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 4) (18, 8) (18, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 25) (4, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles in this graph: [<1, (11, 22), 29, 10>, <9, (15, 26), 16, 25>, <13, (19, 28), 14, 27>, <16, (25, 26), 8, 9>, <19, (15, 26), 3, 12>, <24, (7, 8), 3, 18>].

So the final count of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [6].
