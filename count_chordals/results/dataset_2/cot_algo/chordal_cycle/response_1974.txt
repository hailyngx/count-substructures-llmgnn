Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5)

9. Cycle: 6-8-2-4-6
10. Cycle: 6-8-9-7-6
11. Cycle: 6-0-9-7-6
12. Cycle: 9-7-4-1-9
13. Cycle: 9-6-8-2-9
14. Cycle: 9-6-8-4-9
15. Cycle: 9-6-7-9
16. Cycle: 9-8-4-1-9
17. Cycle: 9-8-2-4-9
18. Cycle: 9-8-6-9
19. Cycle: 9-3-5-6-9
20. Cycle: 9-3-2-8-9
21. Cycle: 9-0-1-4-9
22. Cycle: 9-0-6-8-9
23. Cycle: 1-4-7-9-1
24. Cycle: 1-9-6-8-1
25. Cycle: 3-9-7-6-3
26. Cycle: 3-5-6-8-3
27. Cycle: 8-4-7-6-8
28. Cycle: 8-6-7-9-8
29. Cycle: 8-6-4-1-8
30. Cycle: 8-2-4-1-8
31. Cycle: 8-2-3-5-8
32. Cycle: 5-6-7-9-5
33. Cycle: 5-3-9-7-5
34. Cycle: 2-4-7-9-2
35. Cycle: 2-3-9-6-2
36. Cycle: 0-6-7-9-0
37. Cycle: 0-1-4-7-0
38. Cycle: 0-8-6-9-0
39. Cycle: 0-5-3-9-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (6, 9), 7>
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (6, 8), 9>
3. Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (1, 9), 7>
4. Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (2, 8), 6>
5. Chordal 4-cycle: <7, (6, 9), 7>
6. Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (6, 8), 9>
7. Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (4, 1), 9>
8. Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (8, 6), 9>
9. Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (3, 5), 6>
10. Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (2, 8), 9>
11. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (4, 7), 9>
12. Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (9, 7), 6>
13. Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (4, 7), 6>
14. Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (6, 7), 9>
15. Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (4, 1), 9>
16. Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (2, 4), 1>
17. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (6, 7), 9>
18. Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (4, 7), 9>
19. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (6, 7), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 19 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the final count is [19].
