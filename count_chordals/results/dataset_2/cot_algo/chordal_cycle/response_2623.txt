- Cycle 24: (24, 22, 3, 16)
- Cycle 25: (22, 26, 13, 20)
- Cycle 26: (22, 3, 16, 8)
- Cycle 27: (26, 13, 20, 8)
- Cycle 28: (26, 13, 20, 6)
- Cycle 29: (26, 22, 24, 21)
- Cycle 30: (26, 22, 12, 9)

Step 2:
From the list above, we can identify the chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (4, 18), 2>
- <2, (7, 24), 9>
- <3, (11, 19), 25>
- <4, (17, 6), 29>
- <5, (22, 26), 24>
- <6, (3, 16), 22>
- <7, (20, 13), 26>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found gives us a total of [7].
