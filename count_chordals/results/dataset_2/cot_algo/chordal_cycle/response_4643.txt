Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 12)

- <7, 0, (2, 8), 7>
- <7, 1, (0, 13), 7>
- <6, 9, (4, 12), 6>
- <6, 10, (0, 13), 6>
- <9, 6, (4, 12), 9>
- <2, 8, (5, 11), 2>
- <2, 0, (1, 13), 2>
- <8, 5, (3, 14), 8>
- <5, 13, (1, 11), 5>
- <5, 12, (2, 11), 5>
- <13, 10, (5, 12), 13>
