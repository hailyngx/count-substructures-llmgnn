Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 0) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 14) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (10, 8, 11, 1, 14, 9)
- Cycle 2: (10, 8, 11, 12, 6, 3)
- Cycle 3: (10, 13, 5, 4, 2, 9)
- Cycle 4: (11, 0, 8, 10, 13, 5)
- Cycle 5: (11, 0, 8, 11, 12, 6)
- Cycle 6: (11, 12, 6, 3, 2, 9)
- Cycle 7: (5, 13, 4, 5, 7, 2)
- Cycle 8: (5, 3, 6, 12, 11, 1)
- Cycle 9: (5, 3, 6, 12, 0, 11)
- Cycle 10: (4, 13, 0, 11, 12, 6)
- Cycle 11: (4, 2, 9, 14, 1, 11)
- Cycle 12: (4, 0, 11, 1, 14, 9)
- Cycle 13: (12, 0, 11, 1, 14, 9)
- Cycle 14: (14, 10, 8, 0, 11, 12)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (10, 13), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (11, 12), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (10, 13), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (11, 0), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (12, 6), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (14, 1), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (4, 13), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (5, 7), 2>


Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found = [6]
