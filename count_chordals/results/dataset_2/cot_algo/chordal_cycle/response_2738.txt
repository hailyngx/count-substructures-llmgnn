Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (10, 9) (10, 12) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (11, 6) (11, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 6-5-7-1-6
- Cycle 2: 6-1-4-5-6
- Cycle 3: 6-1-12-10-9-6
- Cycle 4: 6-1-12-4-1-6
- Cycle 5: 6-1-7-13-9-6
- Cycle 6: 6-1-7-13-14-6
- Cycle 7: 6-1-7-5-6
- Cycle 8: 6-1-7-5-3-2-9-6
- Cycle 9: 6-1-7-13-14-8-0-6
- Cycle 10: 6-11-2-9-1-6
- Cycle 11: 6-11-2-13-9-6
- Cycle 12: 6-11-2-13-14-6
- Cycle 13: 6-11-2-3-8-7-1-6
- Cycle 14: 6-11-2-3-8-0-6
- Cycle 15: 6-11-2-13-14-8-0-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, (7, 5), 1, 6>
- <6, (1, 4), 5, 6>
- <6, (1, 12), 10, 9, 6>
- <6, (1, 12), 4, 1, 6>
- <6, (1, 7), 13, 9, 6>
- <6, (1, 7), 13, 14, 6>
- <6, (1, 7), 5, 6>
- <6, (1, 7), 5, 3, 2, 9, 6>
- <6, (1, 7), 13, 14, 8, 0, 6>
- <6, (11, 2), 9, 1, 6>
- <6, (11, 2), 13, 9, 6>
- <6, (11, 2), 13, 14, 6>
- <6, (11, 2), 3, 8, 7, 1, 6>
- <6, (11, 2), 3, 8, 0, 6>
- <6, (11, 2), 13, 14, 8, 0, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [15].
