Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 2) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 8) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 18) (9, 1) (9, 8) (19, 14) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 2) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 18) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (14, 19) (14, 4) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 6) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 18) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 12) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:

Cycle 1: (1, 5, 13, 2, 1)
Cycle 2: (1, 5, 16, 2, 1)
Cycle 3: (1, 9, 8, 15, 1)
Cycle 4: (1, 15, 6, 17, 1)
Cycle 5: (1, 17, 6, 15, 1)
Cycle 6: (5, 11, 12, 2, 5)
Cycle 7: (5, 13, 2, 6, 5)
Cycle 8: (5, 16, 7, 3, 5)
Cycle 9: (5, 1, 9, 8, 5)
Cycle 10: (8, 15, 6, 2, 8)
Cycle 11: (8, 9, 1, 17, 8)
Cycle 12: (8, 18, 7, 3, 8)
Cycle 13: (9, 1, 5, 13, 9)
Cycle 14: (13, 5, 1, 9, 13)
Cycle 15: (15, 1, 5, 16, 15)
Cycle 16: (15, 8, 9, 1, 15)
Cycle 17: (16, 2, 13, 5, 16)
Cycle 18: (16, 5, 1, 15, 16)
Cycle 19: (16, 3, 7, 10, 16)
Cycle 20: (16, 7, 18, 10, 16)
Cycle 21: (16, 0, 4, 14, 16)
Cycle 22: (7, 3, 10, 18, 7)
Cycle 23: (7, 16, 5, 13, 7)
Cycle 24: (7, 18, 8, 15, 7)
Cycle 25: (11, 2, 6, 15, 11)
Cycle 26: (11, 5, 1, 17, 11)
Cycle 27: (11, 12, 3, 7, 11)
Cycle 28: (12, 3, 7, 18, 12)
Cycle 29: (12, 11, 5, 16, 12)
Cycle 30: (12, 18, 10, 3, 12)
Cycle 31: (14, 19, 4, 0, 14)
Cycle 32: (14, 4, 0, 16, 14)
Cycle 33: (19, 14, 4, 0, 19)

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is:

<1, 9, 8, 15, 1>

Step 3:
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
