Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 4) (4, 0) (4, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-8-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-0-9-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-8-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-10-13-11-1
- Cycle 5: 1-10-7-0-1
- Cycle 6: 3-8-5-0-3
- Cycle 7: 3-7-0-9-3
- Cycle 8: 3-12-11-13-3
- Cycle 9: 4-0-7-14-4
- Cycle 10: 4-14-7-1-4
- Cycle 11: 6-1-5-8-6
- Cycle 12: 6-7-0-9-6
- Cycle 13: 6-8-5-0-6
- Cycle 14: 6-8-3-7-6
- Cycle 15: 7-0-5-8-7
- Cycle 16: 7-3-8-10-7
- Cycle 17: 10-13-11-12-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (5, 9), 0, 6>
- <1, (5, 0), 9, 6>
- <1, (1, 7), 0, 10>
- <3, (8, 5), 0, 7>
- <3, (12, 11), 13, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
