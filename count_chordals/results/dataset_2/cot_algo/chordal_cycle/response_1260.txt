Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 7 - 1 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 3 - 7 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 3: 2 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 4: 8 - 0 - 2 - 5 - 8
- Cycle 5: 9 - 4 - 7 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 6: 1 - 7 - 5 - 9 - 1

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (1, 7) -> <1, (1, 7), 4>
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (7, 3) -> <2, (7, 3), 5>
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (7, 4) -> <3, (7, 4), 6>
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (2, 5) -> <4, (2, 5), 8>
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (7, 9) -> <5, (7, 9), 9>
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (5, 9) -> <6, (5, 9), 10>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
