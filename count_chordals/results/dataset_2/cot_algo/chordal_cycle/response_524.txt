Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 3) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 10) (12, 3) (12, 11) (5, 11) (0, 8) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 10) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 19) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 17) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 14) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (16, 8) (16, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-2-18-9-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-13-8-0-11-9-1
- Cycle 3: 3-9-1-19-14-9-3
- Cycle 4: 3-12-11-5-13-6-17-19-1-3
- Cycle 5: 8-15-10-16-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has two chords, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (6, 8), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 has two chords, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (5, 17), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 5 has two chords, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <1, (6, 8), 13, 8, 0, 11, 9>
2. <3, (5, 17), 13, 6, 17, 19, 1>
