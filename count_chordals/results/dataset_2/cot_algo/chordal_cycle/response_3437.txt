Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 4-1-7-3-4
- Cycle 2: 4-1-5-2-4
- Cycle 3: 10-4-1-5-10
- Cycle 4: 14-13-2-5-14

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (2, 13)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (1, 3), 7, 4>
<2, (1, 2), 5, 4>
<3, (1, 5), 10, 4>
<4, (2, 13), 14, 5>
