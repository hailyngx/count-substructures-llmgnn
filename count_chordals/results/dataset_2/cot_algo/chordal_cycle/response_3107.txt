Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There exist multiple cycles in the graph, such as (5, 6, 9, 7), (5, 4, 2, 8), (5, 1, 3, 0), (6, 7, 3, 9), (6, 5, 1, 3), (7, 9, 0, 8), etc.

Step 2:
- Checking for chords:
    - (5, 6, 9, 7) has one chord: (6, 7)
    - (5, 4, 2, 8) has one chord: (4, 8)
    - (5, 1, 3, 0) does not have any chords
    - (6, 7, 3, 9) does not have any chords
    - (6, 5, 1, 3) has one chord: (5, 1)
    - (7, 9, 0, 8) has one chord: (9, 0)

Step 3: 
- Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 1), 3, 0)>
- <2, (4, 8), 5, 4)>
- <3, (6, 7), 9, 5)>
