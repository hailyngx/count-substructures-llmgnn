Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 2) (1, 10) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (15, 10) (15, 16) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 12) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 3) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 19) (14, 9) (14, 16) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 3)

- Cycle 12: (8, 9, 13, 3, 8)
- Cycle 13: (10, 1, 2, 4, 10)
- Cycle 14: (10, 4, 3, 7, 10)

- Cycle 16: (11, 8, 0, 12, 11)
- Cycle 17: (11, 17, 12, 16, 11)
- Cycle 18: (11, 18, 2, 7, 11)
- Cycle 19: (11, 19, 17, 12, 11)
- Cycle 20: (12, 0, 5, 16, 12)
- Cycle 21: (12, 3, 13, 9, 12)
- Cycle 22: (12, 16, 15, 10, 12)

- Cycle 25: (13, 9, 8, 11, 13)
- Cycle 26: (14, 9, 13, 3, 14)
- Cycle 27: (14, 16, 12, 17, 14)
- Cycle 28: (15, 10, 1, 2, 15)
- Cycle 29: (15, 16, 12, 17, 15)
- Cycle 30: (16, 12, 17, 19, 16)
- Cycle 31: (16, 12, 0, 5, 16)
- Cycle 32: (16, 14, 9, 13, 16)
- Cycle 33: (17, 11, 8, 9, 17)
- Cycle 34: (17, 12, 16, 14, 17)
- Cycle 35: (17, 19, 12, 0, 17)
- Cycle 36: (18, 2, 1, 10, 18)
- Cycle 37: (19, 11, 8, 0, 19)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 4), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (6, 7), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <7, (2, 10), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, (7, 6), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <8, (9, 13), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <11, (17, 12), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <12, (0, 5), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <12, (3, 13), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <12, (16, 15), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <13, (3, 4), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <17, (12, 16), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <19, (11, 8), 0>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
- There are 25 chordless cycles in the graph.
- Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [12].
