Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
  1. Cycle 1: 1-5-9-4-1
  2. Cycle 2: 1-7-8-9-1
  3. Cycle 3: 1-3-5-9-1
  4. Cycle 4: 1-3-2-8-1

Step 2:
- The cycles with exactly one chord are:
  1. Cycle 1: <1, (5, 9), 4>
  2. Cycle 2: <1, (7, 8), 9>
  3. Cycle 3: <1, (3, 5), 9>
  4. Cycle 4: <1, (3, 2), 8>

Step 3:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (5, 9), 4>
- <1, (7, 8), 9>
- <1, (3, 5), 9>
- <1, (3, 2), 8>
