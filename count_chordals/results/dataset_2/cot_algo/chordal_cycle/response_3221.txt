Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: (4, 1, 6, 9, 4) 
- Cycle 2: (4, 1, 14, 2, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 8, 6, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 2, 7, 8, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 3, 0, 9, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 5, 10, 11, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 9, 6, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 5, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 3, 7, 8, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 1, 6, 12, 7, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 3, 7, 13, 11, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 1, 6, 12, 13, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 2, 14, 13, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 9, 0, 11, 13, 4)
- Cycle 16: (4, 2, 14, 1, 4)
- Cycle 17: (4, 9, 0, 3, 4)
- Cycle 18: (4, 5, 8, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 19: (4, 1, 14, 13, 11, 4)
- Cycle 20: (4, 1, 6, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 21: (4, 9, 0, 3, 7, 4)
- Cycle 22: (4, 5, 8, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 23: (4, 1, 14, 2, 7, 4)
- Cycle 24: (4, 9, 0, 11, 10, 4)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <4, (2, 7), 8>
- <4, (6, 1), 9>
- <4, (5, 10), 11>
- <4, (3, 7), 8>
- <4, (12, 6), 9>
- <4, (1, 14), 13>
- <4, (13, 11), 5>
- <4, (5, 8), 6>
- <4, (3, 0), 9>
- <4, (2, 14), 13>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
