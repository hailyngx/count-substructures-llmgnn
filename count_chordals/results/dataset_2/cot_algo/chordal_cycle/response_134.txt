Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 11) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 6) (7, 14) (7, 6) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 19) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 1) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 13) (19, 12) (19, 8) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 18) (0, 15) (0, 13) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 16) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 1, 8)
- Cycle 3: (14, 17, 11, 10)
- Cycle 4: (14, 17, 11, 6)
- Cycle 5: (7, 14, 17, 11)
- Cycle 6: (12, 16, 18, 5)
- Cycle 7: (2, 15, 1, 8)
- Cycle 8: (2, 15, 0, 13)
- Cycle 9: (2, 8, 19, 12)
- Cycle 10: (8, 10, 11, 6)
- Cycle 11: (8, 10, 6, 4)
- Cycle 12: (8, 2, 13, 0)
- Cycle 13: (1, 15, 0, 13)
- Cycle 14: (16, 14, 7, 6)

Step 2:
Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (8, 15), 13, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <11, (10, 17), 6, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, (15, 8), 13, 0>

Step 3:
Final number of chordless cycles found: [11]
