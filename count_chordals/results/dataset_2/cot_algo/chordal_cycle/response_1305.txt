This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 17) (9, 23) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 16) (3, 14) (15, 27) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 1) (1, 27) (1, 20) (1, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 20) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 17) (2, 27) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 17) (29, 2) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 23) (20, 26) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 0) (18, 2) (18, 21) (18, 8) (8, 18) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 7) (13, 26) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 28) (28, 26) (28, 13) (28, 4) (28, 24) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 22) (21, 18) (21, 14) (21, 24) (19, 24) (19, 16) (19, 23) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 14) (16, 26) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 25) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 12) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (4, 28) (4, 5) (6, 11) (25, 0) (25, 8) (25, 16) (25, 22) (22, 7) (22, 25) (24, 28) (24, 21) (24, 19) (23, 9) (23, 0) (23, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1-7-8-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-27-15-14-21-18-2-17-11-10-20-1
- Cycle 3: 2-17-11-10-13-26-20-1-27-2
- Cycle 4: 2-17-11-10-13-26-16-25-22-7-1-2
- Cycle 5: 4-28-13-12-16-26-20-1-7-22-25-5-4
- Cycle 6: 5-8-18-21-14-3-5
- Cycle 7: 5-8-18-21-24-28-13-12-16-19-23-0-5
- Cycle 8: 6-11-17-2-27-1-20-10-13-12-5-4-6
- Cycle 9: 7-22-25-16-26-13-10-11-17-2-29-18-8-7
- Cycle 10: 9-17-11-10-13-26-16-25-8-7-1-20-0-23-19-24-28-4-5-12-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- After checking all cycles, we find that Cycle 1, Cycle 3, Cycle 5, and Cycle 8 each have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- There are 10 cycles in total, and 4 of them have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 14, 12, 5>
- <2, 13, 26, 20>
- <4, 28, 13, 12>
- <6, 11, 17, 2>
