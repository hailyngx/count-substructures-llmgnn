Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 11) (9, 3) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 17) (14, 27) (14, 19) (14, 25) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 2) (3, 9) (3, 28) (3, 23) (3, 19) (25, 14) (25, 28) (25, 18) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 0) (22, 8) (23, 3) (23, 22) (23, 2) (23, 28) (7, 20) (7, 27) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 4) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 5) (4, 21) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 24) (18, 25) (18, 4) (18, 20) (15, 21) (15, 0) (20, 7) (20, 18) (20, 11) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 25) (28, 23) (28, 2) (29, 9) (29, 6) (0, 22) (0, 15) (0, 12) (6, 1) (6, 29) (10, 13) (2, 17) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 24) (12, 0) (12, 24) (24, 4) (24, 5) (24, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 27) (27, 14) (27, 7) (27, 13) (8, 22) (8, 21) (8, 11) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 3) (11, 9) (11, 20) (11, 5) (11, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 9-22-23-3-9
- Cycle 2: 9-22-0-15-21-8-9
- Cycle 3: 9-22-8-11-20-7-27-14-25-3-9
- Cycle 4: 9-3-28-25-18-4-21-8-22-9
- Cycle 5: 26-17-19-14-27-7-20-18-25-28-26
- Cycle 6: 26-17-2-23-3-28-25-14-19-17
- Cycle 7: 26-1-6-29-9-22-23-2-17-26
- Cycle 8: 14-27-13-4-24-5-2-17-19-25-14
- Cycle 9: 17-26-1-6-29-9-3-23-2-23-17
- Cycle 10: 3-23-22-0-12-24-4-18-20-11-3
- Cycle 11: 14-27-7-20-11-8-21-4-13-10-14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (22, 3)
- Cycle 2 has chord (22, 8)
- Cycle 3 has chord (11, 20)
- Cycle 4 has chord (22, 8)
- Cycle 5 has chord (26, 14)
- Cycle 6 has chord (17, 14)
- Cycle 7 has chord (17, 14)
- Cycle 8 has chord (27, 19)
- Cycle 9 has chord (17, 12)
- Cycle 10 has chord (23, 22)
- Cycle 11 has chord (11, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- We found 9 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the answer is [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <9, (22, 3), 23, 3>
- <9, (22, 8), 0, 15, 21, 8>
- <9, 3, 28, 25, 18, 4, 21, 8>
- <17, 26, 1, 6, 29, 9, 22, 23, 2>
- <14, 27, 13, 4, 24, 5, 2, 17, 19>
- <17, 26, 2, 23, 3, 28, 25, 14, 19>
- <22, 23, 0, 12, 24, 4, 18, 20, 11>
- <3, 23, 22, 0, 12, 24, 4, 18, 20>
- <14, 27, 7, 20, 11, 8, 21, 4, 13>
