Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 16) (14, 13) (17, 19) (17, 15) (17, 18) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 11) (4, 15) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 15) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 3) (16, 14) (16, 19) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 18) (10, 12) (10, 19) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 15) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 10) (1, 5) (1, 0) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 2) (15, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 7-9-8-13-7
- Cycle 2: 2-5-8-13-2
- Cycle 3: 4-18-17-19-4
- Cycle 4: 4-11-7-9-8-5-2-12-3-13-4
- Cycle 5: 14-13-8-2-15-17-19-16-14
- Cycle 6: 15-11-7-3-12-2-5-1-0-9-15

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <4, (18, 17), 11>
- <4, (18, 10), 11>
- <4, (15, 11), 7>
- <4, (15, 2), 8>
- <4, (15, 11), 7>
- <4, (15, 11), 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
