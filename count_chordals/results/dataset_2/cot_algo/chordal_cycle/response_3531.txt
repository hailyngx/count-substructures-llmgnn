Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 22) (15, 29) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 23) (22, 15) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 21) (0, 16) (0, 1) (20, 15) (20, 26) (4, 27) (4, 23) (4, 16) (4, 2) (1, 0) (1, 26) (1, 17) (26, 18) (26, 20) (26, 1) (26, 21) (26, 11) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 10) (29, 3) (29, 15) (29, 28) (29, 13) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (27, 4) (27, 5) (27, 13) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 7) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 24) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 24) (7, 10) (7, 2) (24, 3) (24, 16) (24, 7) (24, 2) (14, 3) (23, 18) (23, 4) (8, 25) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 19) (21, 22) (21, 26) (5, 17) (5, 27) (5, 12) (5, 10) (12, 5) (19, 28) (19, 17) (19, 6) (25, 8) (13, 29) (13, 27) (10, 28) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 24) (2, 6) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (3, 15, 22, 11, 26, 20, 15)
        - Cycle 2: (3, 15, 22, 21, 26, 11, 22)
        - Cycle 3: (3, 15, 29, 28, 19, 17, 1, 0, 16, 4, 23)
        - Cycle 4: (3, 15, 29, 28, 19, 6, 7, 24, 16, 0)
        - Cycle 5: (3, 15, 29, 28, 10, 7, 24, 16, 4, 27)
        - Cycle 6: (3, 15, 29, 28, 10, 5, 17, 1, 26, 20)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 15, 29, 13, 27, 5, 17, 19, 28)
        - Cycle 8: (22, 11, 7, 24, 16, 4, 23)
        - Cycle 9: (22, 11, 7, 6, 8, 25)
        - Cycle 10: (22, 21, 26, 1, 0, 16, 4, 23)
        - Cycle 11: (22, 21, 26, 11, 7, 24, 16, 0)
        - Cycle 12: (22, 21, 26, 11, 7, 24, 2, 4, 23)
        - Cycle 13: (22, 21, 26, 11, 7, 24, 2, 6, 19, 28)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <3, (22, 11), 26, 15>
        - <3, 15, 22, (21, 26), 11>
        - <3, 15, (29, 28), 19, 17, 1, 0, 16, 4, 23>
        - <3, 15, (29, 28), 19, 6, 7, 24, 16, 0>
        - <3, 15, (29, 28), 10, 7, 24, 16, 4, 27>
        - <3, 15, (29, 28), 10, 5, 17, 1, 26, 20>
        - <3, 15, (29, 13), 27, 5, 17, 19, 28>
        - <(22, 11), 7, 24, 16, 4, 23>
        - <(22, 11), 7, 6, 8, 25>
        - <22, 21, 26, 1, 0, 16, 4, 23>
        - <22, 21, 26, 11, 7, 24, 16, 0>
        - <22, 21, 26, 11, 7, (24, 2), 4, 23>
        - <22, 21, 26, 11, 7, (24, 2), 6, 19, 28>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are [13] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
