Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 16) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 20) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 7) (22, 27) (22, 21) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 20) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 13) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 28) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 26) (17, 21) (7, 18) (7, 29) (7, 15) (25, 14) (0, 10) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 29) (0, 9) (23, 26) (23, 13) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 21) (26, 16) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 13) (9, 10) (9, 0) (14, 25) (28, 2) (28, 0) (21, 22) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 26) (15, 5) (15, 7) (19, 6) (19, 4) (19, 24) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 16) (12, 10) (12, 8) (24, 19) (24, 27) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 26) (16, 27) (13, 6) (13, 23) (13, 29) (13, 20) (20, 11) (20, 5) (20, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - There are several cycles in the graph, but we will focus on cycles of length 4: (1, 10, 11, 17) and (8, 3, 16, 26).

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - The cycle (1, 10, 11, 17) has only one chord: (10, 11).
        - The cycle (8, 3, 16, 26) has only one chord: (3, 16).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There are no chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final result is [0].
