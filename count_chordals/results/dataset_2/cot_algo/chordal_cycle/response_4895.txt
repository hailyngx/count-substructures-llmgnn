Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 6) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 18) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 6) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 12) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 3) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 16) (6, 15) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 10) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 19) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 11-16-4-1-11
- Cycle 2: 11-16-6-15-11
- Cycle 3: 11-16-14-3-11
- Cycle 4: 11-18-17-3-11
- Cycle 5: 16-4-14-3-16
- Cycle 6: 16-14-3-17-16
- Cycle 7: 4-14-3-17-4
- Cycle 8: 4-14-16-6-4
- Cycle 9: 4-16-6-15-4
- Cycle 10: 4-1-18-17-4
- Cycle 11: 4-1-18-11-4
- Cycle 12: 7-4-14-3-7
- Cycle 13: 7-4-16-6-7
- Cycle 14: 7-4-1-18-7
- Cycle 15: 8-19-9-17-8
- Cycle 16: 8-19-15-6-8
- Cycle 17: 8-19-15-8
- Cycle 18: 8-5-0-10-8
- Cycle 19: 8-5-0-12-8
- Cycle 20: 13-2-7-4-13
- Cycle 21: 13-2-3-17-13
- Cycle 22: 5-8-15-6-5
- Cycle 23: 1-4-7-2-1
- Cycle 24: 18-11-16-6-18

Step 2: The cycles that have exactly one chord are:
- <1, (18, 17), 4, 11>
- <2, (3, 17), 14, 16>
- <7, (4, 14), 3, 17>
- <8, (19, 15), 6, 16>
- <13, (2, 7), 4, 14>
- <18, (11, 16), 6, 18>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles, we have [18].
