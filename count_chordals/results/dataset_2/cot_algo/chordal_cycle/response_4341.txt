Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles in the graph, but we will focus on cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 14 - 10 - 0 (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 13 - 3 - 0 (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 3: 0 - 11 - 8 - 1 - 0 (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 4: 0 - 7 - 1 - 10 - 0 (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 5: 1 - 7 - 14 - 10 - 1 (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 6: 1 - 8 - 3 - 9 - 1 (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 7: 3 - 8 - 11 - 0 - 3 (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 8: 3 - 13 - 10 - 12 - 3 (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 9: 4 - 13 - 7 - 14 - 4 (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 10: 5 - 12 - 2 - 14 - 5 (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 11: 6 - 9 - 3 - 13 - 6 (Chordless cycle)

Step 2:
- Checking each of the chordless cycles, we find that none of them have a chord.

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is therefore counted as [11].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 4, 14, 10>
<0, 4, 13, 3>
<0, 11, 8, 1>
<0, 7, 1, 10>
<1, 7, 14, 10>
<1, 8, 3, 9>
<3, 8, 11, 0>
<3, 13, 10, 12>
<4, 13, 7, 14>
<5, 12, 2, 14>
<6, 9, 3, 13>
