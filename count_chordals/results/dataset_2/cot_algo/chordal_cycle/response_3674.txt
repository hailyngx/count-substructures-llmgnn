Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 7, 0, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 8, 0, 5)
- Cycle 4: (2, 4, 7, 0, 2)

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, only Cycle 1 has exactly one chord with edge (9, 4), making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

So, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (9, 4), 5>.
