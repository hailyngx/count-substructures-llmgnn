Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

       - Cycle 1: (7, 11, 12, 7) 
       - Cycle 2: (0, 14, 13, 5, 0)
       - Cycle 3: (2, 7, 12, 13, 2)
       - Cycle 4: (2, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 1, 2)
       - Cycle 5: (2, 8, 9, 4, 1, 7, 12, 13, 2)
       - Cycle 6: (2, 8, 9, 4, 1, 14, 13, 2)
       - Cycle 7: (2, 1, 14, 4, 10, 11, 7, 2)
       - Cycle 8: (2, 6, 7, 11, 10, 4, 14, 13, 2)
       - Cycle 9: (2, 6, 8, 9, 12, 7, 11, 10, 4, 14, 13, 2)
       - Cycle 10: (6, 7, 11, 10, 4, 1, 14, 13, 12, 6)
       - Cycle 11: (6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 4, 1, 2, 6)
       - Cycle 12: (6, 7, 12, 13, 5, 3, 6)
       
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

       - <7, (11, 12), 7>
       - <0, (14, 13), 5, 0>
       - <2, (7, 12), 13, 2>
       - <2, (8, 9), 12, 13, 14, 1, 2>
       - <2, (1, 14), 4, 10, 11, 7, 2>
       - <2, (6, 8), 9, 12, 13, 14, 1, 2>
       - <6, (7, 12), 13, 14, 4, 1, 2, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

       So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
