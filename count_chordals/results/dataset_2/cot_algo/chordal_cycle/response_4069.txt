Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-3-7-1
- Cycle 2: 10-11-6-1-10
- Cycle 3: 10-11-13-7-10
- Cycle 4: 10-14-13-11-10
- Cycle 5: 1-4-10-11-1
- Cycle 6: 1-5-7-3-1
- Cycle 7: 1-6-11-13-1
- Cycle 8: 1-6-13-7-1
- Cycle 9: 1-5-2-7-1
- Cycle 10: 3-6-11-13-3
- Cycle 11: 3-7-12-9-3
- Cycle 12: 10-14-9-0-10
- Cycle 13: 11-6-13-14-11
- Cycle 14: 7-2-9-12-7
- Cycle 15: 12-0-9-14-12
- Cycle 16: 14-9-4-2-14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 6, 3, 7> has a chord (1, 7)
- <10, 11, 6, 1> has a chord (10, 6)
- <10, 11, 13, 7> has a chord (10, 7)
- <10, 14, 13, 11> has a chord (10, 13)
- <1, 4, 10, 11> has a chord (1, 11)
- <1, 5, 7, 3> has a chord (1, 7)
- <1, 6, 11, 13> has a chord (1, 11)
- <1, 6, 13, 7> has a chord (1, 7)
- <1, 5, 2, 7> has a chord (1, 7)
- <3, 6, 11, 13> has a chord (3, 11)
- <3, 7, 12, 9> has a chord (3, 9)
- <10, 14, 9, 0> has a chord (10, 9)
- <11, 6, 13, 14> has a chord (11, 13)
- <7, 2, 9, 12> has a chord (7, 9)
- <12, 0, 9, 14> has a chord (12, 9)
- <14, 9, 4, 2> has a chord (14, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [16]
