Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 19) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 14) (17, 5) (17, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 2) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 12) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 2) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 6) (14, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles in the graph:
1. <1, 3, 7, 12>
2. <1, 3, 16, 4>
3. <1, 3, 7, 19>
4. <1, 10, 2, 9>
5. <1, 10, 15, 13>
6. <3, 7, 19, 11>
7. <3, 1, 2, 9>
8. <3, 16, 12, 7>
9. <7, 19, 18, 6>
10. <7, 12, 16, 3>
11. <7, 12, 16, 1>
12. <10, 2, 19, 7>
13. <10, 15, 13, 5>
14. <11, 19, 18, 6>
15. <11, 19, 7, 3>
16. <13, 15, 10, 1>
17. <13, 15, 10, 2>
18. <13, 15, 10, 11>
19. <16, 4, 5, 13>
20. <16, 4, 5, 0>
21. <16, 1, 3, 7>
22. <16, 12, 7, 19>
23. <17, 5, 13, 15>
24. <17, 9, 14, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles in the graph:
1. <1, 3, 7, 12>, Chord: (1, 7)
2. <1, 3, 16, 4>, Chord: (3, 16)
3. <1, 3, 7, 19>, Chord: (1, 19)
4. <1, 10, 2, 9>, Chord: (10, 2)
5. <1, 10, 15, 13>, Chord: (1, 15)
6. <3, 7, 19, 11>, Chord: (7, 11)
7. <3, 1, 2, 9>, Chord: (1, 2)
8. <3, 16, 12, 7>, Chord: (3, 12)
9. <7, 19, 18, 6>, Chord: (7, 18)
10. <10, 2, 19, 7>, Chord: (2, 19)
11. <10, 15, 13, 5>, Chord: (10, 13)
12. <11, 19, 18, 6>, Chord: (11, 18)
13. <13, 15, 10, 1>, Chord: (10, 1)
14. <13, 15, 10, 2>, Chord: (15, 2)
15. <13, 15, 10, 11>, Chord: (13, 11)
16. <16, 4, 5, 13>, Chord: (4, 5)
17. <16, 4, 5, 0>, Chord: (4, 5)
18. <16, 1, 3, 7>, Chord: (1, 3)
19. <16, 12, 7, 19>, Chord: (7, 19)
20. <17, 5, 13, 15>, Chord: (5, 13)
21. <17, 9, 14, 2>, Chord: (9, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [21].
