Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in this graph, but we only need to consider cycles of length 4 or more. 

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (4, 9, 6, 11)
- Cycle 2: (4, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (4, 9, 12, 6)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 6, 13)
- Cycle 5: (4, 1, 5, 2)
- Cycle 6: (4, 1, 3, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 11, 10, 6)
- Cycle 8: (7, 9, 6, 11)
- Cycle 9: (7, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 10: (7, 9, 12, 6)
- Cycle 11: (7, 0, 2, 8)
- Cycle 12: (7, 0, 14, 12)
- Cycle 13: (0, 14, 12, 6)
- Cycle 14: (0, 14, 5, 1)
- Cycle 15: (6, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 16: (6, 9, 12, 14)
- Cycle 17: (6, 11, 10, 5)
- Cycle 18: (6, 13, 3, 1)
- Cycle 19: (9, 3, 1, 4)
- Cycle 20: (9, 12, 14, 0)
- Cycle 21: (10, 6, 11, 13)
- Cycle 22: (10, 6, 9, 3)
- Cycle 23: (11, 4, 9, 6)
- Cycle 24: (11, 6, 9, 3)
- Cycle 25: (1, 4, 9, 6)
- Cycle 26: (1, 5, 14, 0)
- Cycle 27: (3, 9, 12, 14)
- Cycle 28: (2, 5, 14, 0)
- Cycle 29: (8, 2, 5, 14)
- Cycle 30: (12, 14, 5, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

There is only one unique chordal 4-cycle in this graph:
- <4, (9, 3), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle, the final number is [1].
