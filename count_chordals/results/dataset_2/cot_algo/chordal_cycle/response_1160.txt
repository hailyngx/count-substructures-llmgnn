- (5, 1, 3, 9, 8, 4, 5)
- (5, 4, 8, 9, 3, 1, 5)
- (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3, 5)
- (5, 6, 7, 8, 4, 2, 5)
- (5, 13, 0, 10, 11, 1, 5)
- (5, 13, 0, 10, 3, 1, 5)
- (6, 7, 8, 9, 3, 1, 6)

- (13, 11, 1, 2, 4, 8, 13)

Step 2:
- <1, 11, 10, 13, 1> has a unique chord: (1, 13)
- <4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 4> has a unique chord: (5, 7)
- <1, 3, 14, 11, 1> has a unique chord: (3, 11)
- <4, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4> has a unique chord: (1, 5)
- <5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 5> has a unique chord: (6, 8)

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
