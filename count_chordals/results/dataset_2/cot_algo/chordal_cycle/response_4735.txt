Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 17) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 16) (15, 5) (15, 19) (13, 19) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 11) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 3) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 12) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 6) (3, 16) (3, 19) (7, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (12, 14) (12, 10) (6, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 8, 1, 2, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 9, 8, 4, 11, 18, 17, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 9, 8, 4, 14, 12, 10, 7, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 9, 8, 14, 12, 10, 7, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 2, 1, 8, 9, 10, 7, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (5, 2, 1, 8, 14, 12, 10, 7, 5)
        - Cycle 7: (5, 15, 19, 4, 8, 1, 2, 5)
        - Cycle 8: (5, 15, 19, 4, 14, 12, 10, 7, 5)
        - Cycle 9: (9, 10, 7, 5, 15, 19, 13, 6, 19, 4, 8, 9)
        - Cycle 10: (6, 19, 15, 5, 17, 18, 11, 0, 3, 16, 1, 8, 9, 5)
       
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has chord (1, 8)
        - Cycle 2 has chord (8, 17)
        - Cycle 3 has chord (8, 10)
        - Cycle 4 has chord (8, 10)
        - Cycle 5 has chord (1, 8)
        - Cycle 6 has chord (1, 8)
        - Cycle 7 has chord (1, 2)
        - Cycle 8 has chord (1, 2)
        - Cycle 9 has chord (8, 9)
        - Cycle 10 has chord (5, 17)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 6 chordless 4-cycles, so the answer is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <5, 9, 8, 1>
        <5, 2, 1, 8>
        <5, 2, 1, 8>
        <5, 15, 19, 4>
        <9, 10, 7, 5>
        <6, 19, 15, 5>
