Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:

- Cycle 1: 6-1-4-9-6
- Cycle 2: 6-1-3-9-6
- Cycle 3: 6-1-7-4-6
- Cycle 4: 6-8-9-4-6
- Cycle 5: 6-0-4-9-6
- Cycle 6: 1-3-7-4-1
- Cycle 7: 1-3-2-6-1
- Cycle 8: 1-7-5-2-1
- Cycle 9: 4-8-3-7-4
- Cycle 10: 4-0-5-7-4

Step 2:  
The cycles with exactly one chord (4-cycle) are:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, (1, 4), 9, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, (1, 3), 9, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, (1, 7), 4, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6, (8, 9), 4, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, (0, 4), 9, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (3, 7), 4, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, (3, 2), 6, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, (7, 5), 2, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (8, 3), 7, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <4, (0, 5), 7, 4>

Step 3:  
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [10].
