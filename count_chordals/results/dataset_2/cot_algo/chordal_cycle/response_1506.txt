Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 16) (13, 16) (13, 18) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 13) (18, 2) (5, 15) (5, 8) (6, 12) (6, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 10) (16, 8) (16, 13) (19, 17) (19, 6) (19, 0) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 10) 

Response:
The list of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is as follows:
1. <3, 9, 10, 1>, Chord: (9, 1)
2. <3, 9, 15, 5>, Chord: (3, 15)
3. <3, 9, 2, 12>, Chord: (3, 12)
4. <15, 9, 10, 1>, Chord: (9, 1)
5. <15, 9, 2, 12>, Chord: (9, 12)
6. <15, 5, 8, 16>, Chord: (5, 16)
7. <14, 17, 19, 6>, Chord: (17, 6)
8. <14, 17, 4, 7>, Chord: (14, 7)
9. <14, 4, 7, 11>, Chord: (4, 11)
10. <17, 19, 6, 12>, Chord: (19, 12)
11. <17, 19, 0, 10>, Chord: (19, 10)
12. <17, 4, 1, 10>, Chord: (4, 1)
13. <4, 7, 11, 14>, Chord: (7, 14)
14. <7, 0, 10, 1>, Chord: (0, 1)
15. <8, 5, 15, 1>, Chord: (5, 15)
16. <13, 16, 8, 5>, Chord: (16, 5)
17. <13, 16, 8, 2>, Chord: (16, 2)
18. <2, 8, 5, 15>, Chord: (8, 15)
19. <2, 18, 13, 16>, Chord: (18, 13)
20. <18, 13, 16, 8>, Chord: (13, 8)

The total number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [20].
