Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 15) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 16) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 7) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 7) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 11) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 19) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (16, 6) (16, 18) (19, 12) (19, 0) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 10) (7, 15) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 11) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 1-8-3-9-1
        - Cycle 2: 1-8-11-6-1
        - Cycle 3: 3-9-13-1-3
        - Cycle 4: 8-1-6-11-8
        - Cycle 5: 8-1-13-9-8
        - Cycle 6: 8-3-5-15-8
        - Cycle 7: 8-3-9-13-8
        - Cycle 8: 8-3-5-17-8
        - Cycle 9: 9-13-1-6-9
        - Cycle 10: 9-13-1-8-9
        - Cycle 11: 9-13-9-11-9
        - Cycle 12: 9-3-5-17-9
        - Cycle 13: 11-8-3-5-11
        - Cycle 14: 11-8-3-9-11
        - Cycle 15: 11-8-1-6-11
        - Cycle 16: 11-9-13-1-11
        - Cycle 17: 15-5-3-8-15

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - For each cycle listed above, identify if there is one chord present.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        - [0]

Hence, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
