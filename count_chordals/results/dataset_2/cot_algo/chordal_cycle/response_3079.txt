Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 0) (22, 12) (18, 22) (18, 6) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 26) (23, 11) (23, 7) (23, 24) (23, 27) (26, 8) (26, 2) (26, 16) (26, 0) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 19) (17, 25) (17, 3) (17, 28) (11, 23) (11, 6) (11, 29) (11, 25) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 20) (21, 10) (21, 9) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 16) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 6) (25, 17) (25, 11) (25, 0) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 5) (24, 23) (24, 5) (24, 15) (3, 17) (3, 20) (7, 23) (29, 8) (29, 11) (29, 27) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 3) (20, 9) (27, 23) (27, 29) (2, 26) (2, 19) (9, 21) (9, 4) (9, 20) (9, 15) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 0) (28, 17) (28, 5) (15, 24) (15, 9) (15, 14) (5, 16) (5, 24) (5, 28) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 15) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 26) (0, 25) (0, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 9, 21, 10, 8, 29, 11, 25, 17, 3, 20, 1, 14, 12, 6, 18, 22)
- Cycle 2: (4, 14, 1, 20, 3, 17, 25, 11, 29, 8, 26, 0, 19, 2, 26, 16)
- Cycle 3: (4, 16, 26, 8, 10, 21, 9, 20, 1, 19, 0, 25, 11, 6, 12, 22)
- Cycle 4: (5, 16, 26, 8, 10, 21, 9, 15, 24, 23, 27, 29, 11, 6, 12, 14)
- Cycle 5: (5, 24, 15, 9, 21, 10, 8, 29, 11, 25, 17, 3, 20, 1, 14, 12)
- Cycle 6: (5, 28, 17, 25, 11, 29, 8, 26, 0, 19, 2, 26, 16, 4, 9, 15)
- Cycle 7: (6, 12, 14, 1, 20, 3, 17, 25, 11, 29, 8, 26, 0, 19, 2, 26)
- Cycle 8: (6, 18, 22, 13, 0, 19, 2, 26, 8, 10, 21, 9, 15, 24, 23, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 23, 27, 29, 8, 10, 21, 9, 15, 24, 5, 16, 4, 9, 14, 1)
- Cycle 10: (10, 8, 26, 2, 19, 0, 25, 11, 6, 18, 22, 13, 0, 25, 17, 28)
- Cycle 11: (10, 21, 9, 15, 24, 23, 27, 29, 8, 26, 16, 4, 9, 20, 1, 14)
- Cycle 12: (11, 25, 17, 28, 5, 24, 23, 27, 29, 8, 26, 16, 4, 14, 12, 6)
- Cycle 13: (16, 26, 0, 19, 2, 26, 8, 10, 21, 9, 15, 24, 5, 16, 4, 9)

Step 2: Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (18, 22)>
- Cycle 2: <1, (4, 26)>
- Cycle 3: <21, (9, 20)>
- Cycle 4: <9, (15, 24)>
- Cycle 5: <9, (21, 10)>
- Cycle 6: <1, (3, 17)>
- Cycle 7: <1, (12, 14)>
- Cycle 8: <13, (0, 19)>
- Cycle 9: <23, (27, 29)>
- Cycle 10: <8, (25, 11)>
- Cycle 11: <1, (14, 20)>
- Cycle 12: <1, (17, 28)>
- Cycle 13: <9, (4, 16)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
