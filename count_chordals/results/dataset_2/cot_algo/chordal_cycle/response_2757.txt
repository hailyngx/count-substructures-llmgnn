Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 6, 9, 4, 0>
2. Cycle <0, 6, 9, 3, 0>
3. Cycle <0, 6, 1, 9, 8, 5, 0>
4. Cycle <0, 6, 1, 4, 2, 0>
5. Cycle <0, 6, 1, 9, 8, 7, 2, 0>
6. Cycle <0, 4, 2, 7, 3, 0>
7. Cycle <0, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9, 1, 6, 0>
8. Cycle <0, 4, 8, 7, 2, 0>
9. Cycle <0, 4, 9, 8, 7, 2, 0>
10. Cycle <0, 5, 8, 7, 2, 4, 0>
11. Cycle <0, 5, 8, 9, 1, 6, 7, 2, 4, 0>
12. Cycle <0, 5, 8, 9, 4, 2, 7, 3, 0>
13. Cycle <0, 5, 8, 9, 4, 2, 7, 6, 1, 0>
14. Cycle <0, 5, 8, 9, 4, 2, 7, 6, 9, 1, 0>
15. Cycle <0, 5, 8, 9, 4, 2, 7, 6, 9, 8, 1, 0>
16. Cycle <0, 5, 8, 9, 4, 2, 7, 6, 9, 8, 7, 2, 0>
17. Cycle <0, 5, 8, 9, 4, 2, 7, 6, 9, 8, 7, 3, 0>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
<0, 6, 1, 9, 8, 5, 0>

Step 3:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord in the graph, therefore, the final count is [1].
