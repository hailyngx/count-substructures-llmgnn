The edges are as follows: (18, 0) (18, 29) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 17) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 12) (28, 29) (28, 3) (28, 24) (28, 25) (28, 2) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 24) (9, 22) (9, 14) (8, 25) (8, 3) (25, 28) (25, 8) (25, 27) (25, 17) (27, 25) (27, 17) (5, 26) (5, 11) (26, 5) (26, 2) (17, 22) (17, 23) (17, 25) (17, 27) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 16) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 20) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 2) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 13) (24, 28) (24, 29) (24, 11) (3, 28) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 23) (7, 3) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 10) (13, 21) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (2, 28) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 14) (2, 15) (20, 16) (20, 4) (12, 23) (12, 15) (15, 2) (15, 12) (15, 0) (0, 18) (0, 13) (0, 15) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 20) (4, 14) (10, 19) (10, 13) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 18, 29, 28> 
- Cycle 2: <2, 26, 5, 11> 
- Cycle 3: <4, 6, 1, 19> 
- Cycle 4: <16, 6, 1, 19> 
- Cycle 5: <16, 21, 2, 28> 
- Cycle 6: <17, 25, 8, 3> 
- Cycle 7: <17, 27, 25, 8> 
- Cycle 8: <19, 11, 5, 26> 
- Cycle 9: <11, 22, 17, 27> 
- Cycle 10: <24, 29, 28, 25> 
- Cycle 11: <15, 2, 28, 29> 

Step 2: 
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
  - <0, 18, 29, 28> has a chord <18, 28> 
  - <2, 26, 5, 11> has a chord <2, 11> 
  - <4, 6, 1, 19> has a chord <6, 19> 
  - <16, 6, 1, 19> has a chord <6, 19> 
  - <16, 21, 2, 28> has a chord <21, 28> 
  - <17, 25, 8, 3> has a chord <8, 17> 
  - <17, 27, 25, 8> has a chord <25, 17> 
  - <19, 11, 5, 26> has a chord <11, 5> 
  - <11, 22, 17, 27> has a chord <17, 22> 
  - <24, 29, 28, 25> has a chord <28, 25>
  - <15, 2, 28, 29> has a chord <2, 28> 

Step 3: 
- Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [11] 

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 18, 29, 28> 
<2, 26, 5, 11> 
<4, 6, 1, 19> 
<16, 6, 1, 19> 
<16, 21, 2, 28> 
<17, 25, 8, 3> 
<17, 27, 25, 8> 
<19, 11, 5, 26> 
<11, 22, 17, 27> 
<24, 29, 28, 25> 
<15, 2, 28, 29>
