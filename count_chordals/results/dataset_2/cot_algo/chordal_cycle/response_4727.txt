Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 16) (17, 6) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 3) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (9, 8) (9, 3) (19, 15) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 13) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 16) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 4) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 6) (13, 1) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- (3, 4, 14, 6)
- (3, 4, 5, 10)
- (3, 4, 16, 10)
- (3, 9, 8, 11)
- (1, 12, 7, 2)
- (1, 12, 11, 8)
- (6, 0, 3, 4)
- (6, 0, 14, 4)
- (6, 13, 1, 12)
- (7, 2, 15, 13)
- (7, 2, 18, 3)
- (16, 4, 14, 6)
- (16, 4, 3, 18)
- (5, 10, 16, 4)

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, 4, 14, 6> (Chord: (4, 14))
- <3, 4, 5, 10> (Chord: (4, 5))
- <3, 4, 16, 10> (Chord: (4, 16))
- <3, 9, 8, 11> (Chord: (9, 8))
- <1, 12, 7, 2> (Chord: (7, 2))
- <1, 12, 11, 8> (Chord: (11, 8))
- <6, 0, 3, 4> (Chord: (0, 3))
- <6, 0, 14, 4> (Chord: (0, 14))
- <6, 13, 1, 12> (Chord: (1, 12))
- <7, 2, 15, 13> (Chord: (2, 15))
- <7, 2, 18, 3> (Chord: (2, 18))
- <16, 4, 14, 6> (Chord: (4, 14))
- <16, 4, 3, 18> (Chord: (4, 3))
- <5, 10, 16, 4> (Chord: (10, 16))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
