Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 3) (7, 10) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (16, 7) (2, 3) (12, 14) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 1) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 6) (1, 18) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 15) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 9, 8, 11, 0)
- Cycle 2: (3, 9, 8, 11, 13)
- Cycle 3: (3, 9, 0, 11, 13)
- Cycle 4: (3, 9, 0, 15, 13)
- Cycle 5: (3, 9, 8, 4, 15)
- Cycle 6: (3, 8, 4, 13, 15)
- Cycle 7: (3, 8, 4, 15, 0)
- Cycle 8: (3, 8, 11, 7, 16)
- Cycle 9: (3, 8, 11, 7, 10)
- Cycle 10: (3, 8, 11, 0, 15)
- Cycle 11: (3, 8, 9, 0, 15)
- Cycle 12: (3, 8, 9, 0, 11)
- Cycle 13: (3, 8, 9, 4, 15)
- Cycle 14: (3, 2, 10, 14, 6)
- Cycle 15: (3, 2, 10, 14, 12)
- Cycle 16: (3, 2, 10, 18, 19)
- Cycle 17: (3, 2, 10, 18, 15)
- Cycle 18: (3, 2, 10, 7, 16)
- Cycle 19: (3, 2, 10, 7, 11)
- Cycle 20: (3, 2, 10, 7, 18)
- Cycle 21: (3, 2, 10, 14, 6)
- Cycle 22: (3, 5, 9, 8, 4)
- Cycle 23: (3, 5, 9, 0, 11)
- Cycle 24: (3, 5, 9, 0, 15)
- Cycle 25: (3, 5, 9, 8, 11)
- Cycle 26: (3, 5, 9, 0, 15)
- Cycle 27: (3, 5, 9, 4, 15)
- Cycle 28: (3, 5, 9, 8, 11)
- Cycle 29: (3, 5, 9, 0, 15)
- Cycle 30: (3, 5, 9, 4, 15)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, 2, 10, 14, 6>: Chord (3, 6)
- <3, 2, 10, 14, 12>: Chord (3, 12)
- <3, 2, 10, 7, 16>: Chord (3, 16)
- <3, 2, 10, 7, 11>: Chord (3, 11)
- <3, 2, 10, 7, 18>: Chord (3, 18)
- <3, 5, 9, 8, 4>: Chord (5, 8)
- <3, 5, 9, 0, 11>: Chord (5, 11)
- <3, 5, 9, 0, 15>: Chord (5, 15)
- <3, 5, 9, 8, 11>: Chord (5, 11)
- <3, 5, 9, 4, 15>: Chord (5, 15)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
