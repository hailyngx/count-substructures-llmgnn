Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 18) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 25) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 9) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 3) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 16) (26, 0) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 4) (4, 28) (4, 9) (4, 10) (27, 17) (27, 6) (25, 0) (25, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 11) (9, 20) (9, 4) (9, 11) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 3) (8, 25) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 23) (16, 18) (16, 22) (6, 12) (6, 27) (6, 15) (17, 27) (17, 8) (17, 5) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 24) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 22) (24, 8) (24, 13) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 5) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 9) (3, 2) (3, 26) (3, 29) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 23) (23, 1) (23, 19) (23, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 1-21-0-20-1
- Cycle 2: 1-21-18-26-3-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-21-13-12-7-10-4-9-20-0-1
- Cycle 4: 1-29-26-0-1
- Cycle 5: 1-29-26-3-29
- Cycle 6: 1-29-26-20-0-1
- Cycle 7: 1-29-3-26-0-1
- Cycle 8: 21-13-12-7-10-4-28-26-29-3-2-21

Step 2:

Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <0, 20>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <18, 3>
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has a chord <26, 0>
- Cycle 5 has a chord <29, 3>
- Cycle 6 has a chord <26, 0>
- Cycle 7 has a chord <26, 0>
- Cycle 8 has no chord

Step 3:

Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [5] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 21, 0, 20> with a chord <0, 20>
- <1, 21, 18, 26, 3, 2> with a chord <18, 3>
- <1, 29, 26, 0> with a chord <26, 0>
- <1, 29, 26, 3> with a chord <29, 3>
- <21, 13, 12, 7, 10, 4, 28, 26, 29, 3, 2>
