- Cycle 8: (25, 18, 21, 23)
- Cycle 9: (20, 15, 7, 6)
- Cycle 10: (20, 4, 29, 18)
- Cycle 11: (13, 25, 24, 19)
- Cycle 12: (15, 0, 29, 18)
- Cycle 13: (4, 20, 15, 0)

- Cycle 25: (9, 7, 15, 20)
- Cycle 26: (9, 11, 13, 25)
- Cycle 27: (2, 19, 24, 3)
- Cycle 28: (22, 19, 24, 3)
- Cycle 29: (24, 3, 8, 9)
- Cycle 30: (23, 13, 25, 1)
- Cycle 31: (23, 21, 18, 25)
- Cycle 32: (14, 12, 11, 13)
- Cycle 33: (28, 0, 3, 1)
- Cycle 34: (10, 4, 20, 15)
- Cycle 35: (10, 27, 16, 26)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 <1, 3, 24, 25> has a chord (3, 25)
- Cycle 3 <3, 1, 25, 20> has a chord (1, 20)
- Cycle 4 <3, 0, 15, 20> has a chord (0, 15)
- Cycle 6 <25, 13, 23, 12> has a chord (13, 23)
- Cycle 7 <25, 24, 19, 26> has a chord (24, 19)
- Cycle 8 <25, 18, 21, 23> has a chord (18, 21)
- Cycle 10 <20, 4, 29, 18> has a chord (4, 29)
- Cycle 12 <15, 0, 29, 18> has a chord (0, 29)
- Cycle 15 <18, 25, 13, 5> has a chord (25, 5)
- Cycle 16 <18, 29, 22, 19> has a chord (29, 22)
- Cycle 18 <19, 24, 3, 1> has a chord (24, 1)
- Cycle 29 <24, 3, 8, 9> has a chord (3, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [11]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, 3, 24, 25>, <3, 1, 25, 20>, <3, 0, 15, 20>, <25, 13, 23, 12>, <25, 24, 19, 26>, <25, 18, 21, 23>, <20, 4, 29, 18>, <15, 0, 29, 18>, <18, 25, 13, 5>, <18, 29, 22, 19>, <19, 24, 3, 1>
