Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 1, 3, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 2, 6, 3, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 3, 6, 9, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 7, 0, 2, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (2, 6)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (0, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordless cycles is [0].
