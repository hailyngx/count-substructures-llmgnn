Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 10) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 4) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 12) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 14) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 15) (1, 16) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 13) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 13) (15, 17) (15, 14) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 1) (2, 4) (13, 3) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-16-4-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-7-8-14-13-0
- Cycle 3: 0-11-1-10-9-0
- Cycle 4: 1-16-3-0-11-1
- Cycle 5: 1-10-9-17-15-1
- Cycle 6: 3-16-18-9-17-3
- Cycle 7: 4-16-18-9-10-4
- Cycle 8: 4-5-7-8-19-4
- Cycle 9: 16-18-10-19-12-16
- Cycle 10: 18-16-12-19-8-18

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, (3, 4), 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, (7, 14), 8>
- Cycle 3: <0, (1, 10), 9>
- Cycle 4: <1, (0, 11), 16>
- Cycle 5: <1, (9, 15), 17>
- Cycle 6: <3, (9, 17), 16>
- Cycle 7: <4, (9, 10), 18>
- Cycle 8: <4, (7, 8), 5>
- Cycle 9: <16, (10, 19), 18>
- Cycle 10: <18, (12, 19), 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
