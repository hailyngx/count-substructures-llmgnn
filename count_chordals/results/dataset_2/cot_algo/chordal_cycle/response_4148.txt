Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: 0-6-1-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-6-9-3-0
- Cycle 3: 0-6-4-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-1-6-4-0
- Cycle 5: 0-3-9-6-0
- Cycle 6: 1-6-9-7-1
- Cycle 7: 2-4-6-0-2
- Cycle 8: 3-9-7-5-3
- Cycle 9: 4-6-9-7-4
- Cycle 10: 4-6-0-8-4

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, (6, 4), 2, 0>
- <0, (9, 3), 6, 0>
- <0, (1, 8), 6, 0>
- <1, (9, 7), 6, 1>
- <4, (9, 7), 6, 4>

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [5]
