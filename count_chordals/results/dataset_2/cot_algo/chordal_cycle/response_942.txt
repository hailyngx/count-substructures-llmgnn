Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 15) (16, 7) (16, 6) (1, 19) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 19) (5, 2) (5, 10) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 4) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 4) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 4) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 18) (4, 17) (4, 11) (4, 19) (15, 2) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 10) (18, 11) (18, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (7, 12, 6, 16, 7)
- Cycle 2: (7, 12, 8, 0, 7)
- Cycle 3: (0, 2, 14, 6, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 2, 14, 18, 11, 13, 15, 9, 8, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 2, 14, 18, 11, 13, 10, 5, 2)
- Cycle 6: (1, 19, 6, 14, 2, 0, 8, 12, 7, 16, 6)
- Cycle 7: (1, 19, 6, 14, 18, 11, 4, 17, 7, 16, 6)
- Cycle 8: (3, 0, 8, 12, 6, 16, 7, 17, 4, 11, 13, 15, 9, 8)
- Cycle 9: (3, 0, 8, 12, 6, 14, 18, 11, 13, 15, 9, 8)
- Cycle 10: (3, 0, 2, 14, 18, 11, 4, 17, 7, 10, 13, 15, 9, 8)
- Cycle 11: (3, 17, 4, 11, 13, 12, 6, 16, 7, 10, 5, 2, 0, 3)
- Cycle 12: (4, 17, 7, 16, 6, 12, 13, 15, 9, 8, 0, 3, 19, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <7, 16, 6, 12> where the chord is (6, 12).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- Count = [12]
