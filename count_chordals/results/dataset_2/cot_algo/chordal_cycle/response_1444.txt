Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 12) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-0-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-12-5-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-0-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-2-13-1
- Cycle 5: 3-0-5-7-3
- Cycle 6: 3-7-0-5-3
- Cycle 7: 3-6-14-7-3
- Cycle 8: 4-12-11-13-4
- Cycle 9: 4-9-2-10-4
- Cycle 10: 5-0-3-1-5
- Cycle 11: 5-7-14-6-5
- Cycle 12: 8-12-4-1-8
- Cycle 13: 8-3-7-1-8
- Cycle 14: 8-9-2-10-8
- Cycle 15: 12-4-1-3-12

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (2, 13), 4>
- <1, (4, 9), 12>
- <1, (7, 14), 5>
- <1, (9, 2), 13>
- <3, (0, 5), 7>
- <3, (6, 14), 7>
- <4, (11, 12), 9>
- <4, (2, 10), 12>
- <5, (3, 1), 0>
- <5, (6, 14), 7>
- <8, (2, 10), 9>
- <8, (7, 1), 3>
- <8, (2, 10), 9>
- <12, (3, 1), 4>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [14].
