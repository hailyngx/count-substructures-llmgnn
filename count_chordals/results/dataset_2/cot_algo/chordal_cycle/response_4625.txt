Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. 5-9-7-4
2. 10-11-13-6
3. 10-11-12-3
4. 5-6-13-0
5. 5-6-1-2
6. 5-7-3-10
7. 5-0-14-4
8. 7-4-14-10
9. 7-4-6-11
10. 7-3-12-0

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1, (3, 11), 6>
2. <2, (1, 13), 6>

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
