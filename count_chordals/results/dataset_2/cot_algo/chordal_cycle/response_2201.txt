Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-2-3-1
- Cycle 2: 3-9-4-7-3
- Cycle 3: 4-9-8-5-4
- Cycle 4: 5-8-2-6-5
- Cycle 5: 6-1-3-9-6
- Cycle 6: 7-9-4-3-7
- Cycle 7: 8-9-4-5-8
- Cycle 8: 9-3-1-6-9

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordless cycle 1: <1, 2, 3, 6>
- Chordal cycle 2: <3, (7, 4), 9>
- Chordal cycle 3: <4, (8, 5), 9>
- Chordless cycle 4: <5, 2, 8, 6>
- Chordless cycle 5: <6, 1, 9, 3>
- Chordal cycle 6: <7, (4, 3), 9>
- Chordal cycle 7: <8, (9, 4), 5>
- Chordal cycle 8: <9, (6, 3), 1>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [3]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [3].
