Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 20) (26, 6) (1, 14) (21, 4) (21, 2) (21, 29) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 24) (6, 3) (6, 4) (0, 27) (0, 18) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 18) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 5) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 17) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 8) (17, 2) (17, 23) (4, 21) (4, 6) (4, 16) (7, 3) (7, 28) (7, 23) (7, 14) (15, 13) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 29) (23, 26) (23, 11) (23, 17) (23, 7) (5, 26) (5, 11) (5, 20) (12, 2) (12, 13) (8, 18) (8, 20) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 24) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 22) (22, 19) (22, 24) (3, 6) (3, 7) (24, 9) (24, 6) (24, 28) (24, 22) (16, 18) (16, 4) (25, 9) (25, 10) (29, 21) (29, 27) (29, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 28) (20, 26) (20, 5) (20, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (9, 26, 5, 11, 23)
        - Cycle 2: (9, 26, 20, 5, 11)
        - Cycle 3: (9, 26, 5, 20, 26)
        - Cycle 4: (9, 26, 23, 11, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (9, 26, 6, 24, 22)
        - Cycle 6: (9, 26, 6, 3, 7)
        - Cycle 7: (9, 26, 6, 4, 21)
        - Cycle 8: (9, 26, 20, 8, 18)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - Cycle 1 has 1 chord: <(5, 11)>
        - Cycle 2 has 1 chord: <(20, 11)>
        - Cycle 3 has 1 chord: <(5, 20)>
        - Cycle 4 has 1 chord: <(11, 23)>
        - Cycle 5 has 1 chord: <(6, 24)>
        - Cycle 6 has 0 chords
        - Cycle 7 has 0 chords
        - Cycle 8 has 1 chord: <(20, 8)>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are 2 chordless 4-cycles in the graph, so the final number is [2].

        The unique chordal 4-cycles found are <1, (6, 24)> and <2, (5, 20)>.
