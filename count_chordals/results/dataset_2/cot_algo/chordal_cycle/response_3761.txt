Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
    - Cycle 1: 4-7-5-2-4
    - Cycle 2: 4-7-6-2-4
    - Cycle 3: 4-9-8-6-4
    - Cycle 4: 4-9-3-6-4
    - Cycle 5: 4-9-1-2-4
    - Cycle 6: 4-9-1-5-4
    - Cycle 7: 4-9-1-0-4
    - Cycle 8: 4-1-0-7-4
    - Cycle 9: 4-1-0-3-4
    - Cycle 10: 7-6-2-5-7
    - Cycle 11: 7-6-8-9-7
    - Cycle 12: 7-6-3-9-7
    - Cycle 13: 7-5-2-1-7
    - Cycle 14: 7-5-1-9-7
    - Cycle 15: 7-5-1-0-7
    - Cycle 16: 7-0-3-9-7
    

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <4, (5, 2), 7> - chord (5, 2)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (6, 2), 7> - chord (6, 2)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (8, 6), 9> - chord (8, 6)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (3, 9), 6> - chord (3, 9)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, (1, 2), 9> - chord (1, 2)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, (1, 5), 9> - chord (1, 5)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, (0, 1), 9> - chord (0, 1)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, (0, 7), 1> - chord (0, 7)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (0, 3), 1> - chord (0, 3)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <7, (2, 5), 6> - chord (2, 5)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <7, (8, 6), 9> - chord (8, 6)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <7, (3, 9), 6> - chord (3, 9)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <7, (1, 2), 5> - chord (1, 2)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 14: <7, (1, 9), 5> - chord (1, 9)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 15: <7, (0, 1), 5> - chord (0, 1)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 16: <7, (3, 9), 0> - chord (3, 9)
    

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
    - There are 0 chordless cycles in this graph.
    
Final answer: [16]
