Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 19) (16, 0) (16, 6) (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 14) (4, 25) (7, 22) (18, 2) (18, 8) (22, 7) (22, 14) (22, 6) (8, 18) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 2) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 3) (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 17) (26, 13) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 3) (15, 9) (15, 20) (15, 25) (20, 15) (28, 29) (28, 12) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 12) (29, 24) (12, 28) (12, 29) (23, 11) (23, 1) (23, 0) (23, 27) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 23) (0, 17) (25, 4) (25, 9) (25, 15) (25, 6) (27, 23) (27, 3) (27, 5) (19, 11) (19, 3) (6, 16) (6, 22) (6, 25) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 6) (17, 3) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 27) (3, 19) (3, 17) (14, 1) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 5) (24, 29) (24, 5) (5, 29) (5, 27) (5, 14) (5, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (14, 5, 27, 3, 2, 13, 21, 1, 23, 0, 16, 6, 22, 7, 9, 15, 20, 25, 4, 21, 14)
- Cycle 2: (17, 6, 22, 7, 9, 15, 20, 25, 4, 21, 1, 14, 22, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 22, 14, 1, 21, 13, 2, 18, 8, 10, 3, 27, 5, 29, 28, 12, 24)
- Cycle 4: (6, 22, 7, 9, 25, 15, 20, 28, 29, 5, 14, 22)

Step 2:
Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- <17, (6, 22), 9> with chord (6, 22)
- <17, (6, 22), 28> with chord (6, 22)
- <17, (6, 22), 5> with chord (6, 22)
- <17, (6, 9), 15> with chord (6, 9)

Step 3:
Number of chordless 4-cycles = [0]
