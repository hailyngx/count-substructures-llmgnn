Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 17) (9, 8) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 15) (4, 7) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 12) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 18) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (12, 15) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 2) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 19) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 16) (13, 14) (13, 1) (19, 14) (19, 12) (19, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 17, 14, 13, 1, 3, 9, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 15, 17, 10, 3, 1, 7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (0, 8, 11, 2, 1, 13, 14, 19, 12, 15, 7, 4, 16, 10, 6, 19, 14, 13, 1, 2)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (14, 5)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (17, 4)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (1, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (14, 5), 3, 9>
- <4, (17, 4), 7, 15>
- <14, (1, 14), 19, 12>
