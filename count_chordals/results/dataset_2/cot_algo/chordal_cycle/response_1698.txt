Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle 1-4-5-0-1 with edges (1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (0, 1).
2. Cycle 6-1-5-4-2 with edges (6, 1), (1, 5), (5, 4), (4, 2).
3. Cycle 6-1-2-9-4 with edges (6, 1), (1, 2), (2, 9), (9, 4).
4. Cycle 1-2-6-0-5 with edges (1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 0), (0, 5).
5. Cycle 1-6-8-7-1 with edges (1, 6), (6, 8), (8, 7), (7, 1).
6. Cycle 1-6-0-2-1 with edges (1, 6), (6, 0), (0, 2), (2, 1).
7. Cycle 1-5-3-9-2 with edges (1, 5), (5, 3), (3, 9), (9, 2).
8. Cycle 1-5-4-9-2 with edges (1, 5), (5, 4), (4, 9), (9, 2).
9. Cycle 1-2-4-3-9 with edges (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 3), (3, 9).
10. Cycle 1-5-4-3-9 with edges (1, 5), (5, 4), (4, 3), (3, 9).
11. Cycle 3-4-5-0-6 with edges (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (0, 6).
12. Cycle 3-5-4-2-9 with edges (3, 5), (5, 4), (4, 2), (2, 9).
13. Cycle 3-9-4-2-0 with edges (3, 9), (9, 4), (4, 2), (2, 0).
14. Cycle 3-6-0-2-9 with edges (3, 6), (6, 0), (0, 2), (2, 9).

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, (4, 2), 5>.
2. <1, (6, 9), 2>.
3. <1, (2, 6), 5>.
4. <1, (6, 8), 7>.
5. <1, (0, 5), 3>.
6. <1, (5, 9), 2>.
7. <1, (3, 9), 4>.
8. <1, (4, 3), 9>.

Step 3:
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
