Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (5, 8) (5, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle: 6-9-1-6
2. Cycle: 6-9-2-6
3. Cycle: 6-9-8-6
4. Cycle: 6-9-0-6
5. Cycle: 6-1-3-6
6. Cycle: 6-1-7-6
7. Cycle: 6-3-8-6
8. Cycle: 6-4-8-6
9. Cycle: 9-2-7-9
10. Cycle: 9-1-3-9
11. Cycle: 9-8-7-9
12. Cycle: 9-0-4-9
13. Cycle: 1-7-2-1
14. Cycle: 3-0-7-3
15. Cycle: 4-8-0-4
16. Cycle: 8-7-5-8

Step 2:
Checking for a single chord in each cycle:
- <6, 9, (1, 3), 6> (Chord: 1-3)
- <6, 9, (2, 8), 6> (Chord: 2-8)
- <6, 9, (0, 8), 6> (Chord: 0-8)
- <6, 1, (3, 7), 6> (Chord: 3-7)
- <6, 3, (1, 8), 6> (Chord: 1-8)
- <6, 4, (8, 0), 6> (Chord: 8-0)
- <9, 2, (7, 9), 9> (Chord: 7-9)
- <9, 1, (3, 9), 9> (Chord: 3-9)
- <9, 8, (7, 9), 9> (Chord: 7-9)
- <9, 0, (4, 9), 9> (Chord: 4-9)
- <1, 7, (2, 1), 1> (Chord: 2-1)
- <3, 0, (7, 3), 3> (Chord: 7-3)
- <4, 8, (0, 4), 4> (Chord: 0-4)
- <8, 7, (5, 8), 8> (Chord: 5-8)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [14].
