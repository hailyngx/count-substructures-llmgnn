- Cycle 3: (15, 11, 25, 17)
- Cycle 4: (27, 21, 2, 22)
- Cycle 5: (27, 16, 26, 6)
- Cycle 6: (8, 0, 9, 1)
- Cycle 7: (13, 14, 10, 20)
- Cycle 8: (6, 28, 2, 22)
- Cycle 9: (6, 18, 25, 17)
- Cycle 10: (6, 4, 5, 22)
- Cycle 11: (28, 2, 21, 27)
- Cycle 12: (28, 10, 14, 13)
- Cycle 13: (4, 6, 26, 16)
- Cycle 14: (18, 25, 11, 15)

- Cycle 18: (2, 28, 0, 8)
- Cycle 19: (2, 22, 5, 4)
- Cycle 20: (2, 21, 27, 16)
- Cycle 21: (22, 5, 4, 6)
- Cycle 22: (22, 21, 27, 15)
- Cycle 23: (25, 11, 7, 15)
- Cycle 24: (25, 18, 6, 28)
- Cycle 25: (25, 17, 12, 7)
- Cycle 26: (11, 15, 24, 12)
- Cycle 27: (14, 10, 20, 26)
- Cycle 28: (1, 9, 0, 8)
- Cycle 29: (23, 3, 27, 21)
- Cycle 30: (29, 23, 3, 27)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (9, 0), 8>
- <3, (15, 27), 23>
- <4, (6, 26), 16>
- <5, (4, 22), 6>
- <6, (18, 25), 17>
- <7, (12, 24), 15>
- <10, (14, 20), 13>
- <11, (7, 25), 15>
- <12, (12, 22), 17>
- <16, (15, 21), 27>
- <19, (2, 28), 8>
- <21, (2, 22), 28>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are [11] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
