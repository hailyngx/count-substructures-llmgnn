Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find all cycles of length 4 in the graph:

1. (4, 7, 1, 8) - Cycle of length 4
2. (4, 7, 2, 9) - Cycle of length 4
3. (4, 7, 8, 1) - Cycle of length 4
4. (4, 5, 6, 9) - Cycle of length 4
5. (4, 5, 2, 7) - Cycle of length 4
6. (4, 5, 8, 1) - Cycle of length 4
7. (4, 3, 5, 0) - Cycle of length 4
8. (7, 1, 6, 9) - Cycle of length 4
9. (7, 1, 8, 5) - Cycle of length 4
10. (7, 2, 5, 0) - Cycle of length 4
11. (6, 5, 2, 9) - Cycle of length 4
12. (6, 5, 0, 1) - Cycle of length 4
13. (9, 2, 7, 1) - Cycle of length 4
14. (9, 2, 5, 8) - Cycle of length 4
15. (5, 4, 3, 0) - Cycle of length 4

Next, let's identify the chordal 4-cycles among these cycles:

1. <4, 7, 1, 8> - No chord
2. <4, 7, 2, 9> - No chord
3. <4, 7, 8, 1> - Chord: (1, 8)
4. <4, 5, 6, 9> - No chord
5. <4, 5, 2, 7> - Chord: (5, 7)
6. <4, 5, 8, 1> - Chord: (1, 8)
7. <4, 3, 5, 0> - No chord
8. <7, 1, 6, 9> - No chord
9. <7, 1, 8, 5> - Chord: (5, 8)
10. <7, 2, 5, 0> - Chord: (2, 5)
11. <6, 5, 2, 9> - Chord: (5, 2)
12. <6, 5, 0, 1> - No chord
13. <9, 2, 7, 1> - No chord
14. <9, 2, 5, 8> - Chord: (5, 8)
15. <5, 4, 3, 0> - No chord

After checking for chords, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- <4, 7, 8, 1> with chord (1, 8)
- <4, 5, 2, 7> with chord (5, 7)
- <4, 5, 8, 1> with chord (1, 8)
- <7, 1, 8, 5> with chord (5, 8)
- <7, 2, 5, 0> with chord (2, 5)
- <6, 5, 2, 9> with chord (5, 2)
- <9, 2, 5, 8> with chord (5, 8)

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
