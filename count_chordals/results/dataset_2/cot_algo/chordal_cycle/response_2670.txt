Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 29) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 21) (3, 6) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 24) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 16) (2, 17) (29, 13) (29, 2) (29, 24) (29, 10) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (20, 26) (23, 4) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 28) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 26) (9, 21) (26, 20) (26, 9) (26, 27) (0, 4) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 5) (27, 26) (27, 0) (27, 25) (14, 0) (14, 6) (19, 28) (19, 10) (19, 16) (1, 23) (1, 25) (1, 5) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 1) (25, 12) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 21) (21, 22) (21, 9) (21, 16) (21, 11) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 10) (24, 7) (24, 29) (24, 18) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 11) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 11) (12, 25) (12, 28) (10, 29) (10, 19) (10, 5) (18, 24) (18, 28) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 17) (11, 6) (28, 23) (28, 19) (28, 12) (28, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There is a 4-cycle <4, 7, 25, 1, 5> with no chord.
- There is a 4-cycle <23, 4, 7, 25, 1> with a chord (2, 16).
- There is a 4-cycle <7, 25, 1, 5, 0> with no chord.
- There is a 4-cycle <25, 1, 5, 0, 27> with no chord.
- There is a 4-cycle <1, 5, 0, 27, 26> with no chord.
- There is a 4-cycle <5, 0, 27, 26, 20> with no chord.
- There is a 4-cycle <0, 27, 26, 20, 2> with no chord.
- There is a 4-cycle <27, 26, 20, 2, 23> with no chord.
- There is a 4-cycle <26, 20, 2, 23, 4> with no chord.
- There is a 4-cycle <20, 2, 23, 4, 7> with a chord (8, 16).
- There is a 4-cycle <2, 23, 4, 7, 25> with a chord (0, 27).
- There is a 4-cycle <22, 9, 8, 16, 2> with no chord.
- There is a 4-cycle <19, 28, 12, 25, 1> with a chord (10, 16).
- There is a 4-cycle <25, 12, 28, 18, 24> with no chord.
- There is a 5-cycle <6, 14, 0, 27, 26> with a chord (3, 11).
- There is a 5-cycle <11, 17, 2, 23, 4> with no chord.

Step 2:
- From the cycles found in step 1, the only cycle with exactly one chord is <23, 4, 7, 25, 1> with a chord (2, 16).

Step 3:
- Count of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <23, 4, 7, 25, 1> with a chord (2, 16)
