Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 25) (27, 19) (27, 23) (18, 15) (18, 22) (18, 23) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 16) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 20) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 2) (0, 10) (0, 2) (20, 10) (20, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 29) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 12) (21, 28) (21, 19) (21, 29) (28, 21) (28, 4) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 4) (24, 26) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 14) (16, 22) (16, 6) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 9) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 7) (4, 28) (4, 26) (4, 19) (25, 15) (25, 29) (19, 15) (19, 27) (19, 21) (19, 4) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (3, 7) (7, 24) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 24) (14, 1) (14, 29) (23, 27) (23, 18) (23, 9) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 23) (9, 12) (12, 6) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 9) (8, 20) (8, 7) (29, 5) (29, 21) (29, 25) (29, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (15, 19, 27, 23, 15)
- (15, 18, 22, 26, 15)
- (15, 25, 29, 21, 15)
- (27, 19, 21, 29, 27)
- (18, 22, 26, 24, 18)
- (22, 16, 6, 10, 22)
- (10, 17, 2, 5, 10)
- (17, 13, 9, 23, 17)
- (0, 10, 20, 8, 0)
- (20, 8, 7, 24, 20)
- (5, 2, 0, 10, 5)
- (6, 16, 22, 26, 6)
- (21, 28, 4, 19, 21)
- (28, 26, 24, 12, 28)
- (26, 4, 19, 27, 26)
- (24, 12, 6, 16, 24)
- (16, 6, 12, 24, 16)
- (13, 17, 10, 0, 13)
- (1, 5, 2, 13, 1)
- (4, 28, 21, 29, 4)
- (25, 15, 18, 22, 25)
- (2, 17, 10, 0, 2)
- (11, 7, 24, 26, 11)
- (7, 8, 20, 10, 7)
- (14, 1, 5, 2, 14)
- (23, 9, 13, 17, 23)
- (9, 12, 6, 16, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <15, (18, 23), 25>
- <15, (18, 22), 26>
- <15, (25, 29), 21>
- <27, (19, 21), 29>
- <18, (22, 26), 24>
- <22, (16, 6), 10>
- <10, (17, 2), 5>
- <17, (13, 9), 23>
- <0, (10, 20), 8>
- <20, (8, 7), 24>
- <5, (2, 0), 10>
- <6, (16, 22), 26>
- <21, (28, 4), 19>
- <28, (26, 24), 12>
- <26, (4, 19), 27>
- <24, (12, 6), 16>
- <16, (6, 12), 24>
- <13, (17, 10), 0>
- <1, (5, 2), 13>
- <4, (28, 21), 29>
- <25, (15, 18), 22>
- <2, (17, 10), 0>
- <11, (7, 24), 26>
- <7, (8, 20), 10>
- <14, (1, 5), 2>
- <23, (9, 13), 17>
- <9, (12, 6), 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are [27] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
