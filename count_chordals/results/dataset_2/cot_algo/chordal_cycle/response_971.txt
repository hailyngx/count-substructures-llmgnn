Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 13) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 10) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 6 - 1 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 6 - 13 - 14 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 4 - 10 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 4 - 5 - 11 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 3 - 9 - 10 - 0
- Cycle 6: 0 - 3 - 8 - 12 - 0
- Cycle 7: 0 - 2 - 14 - 13 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 4, 6, 5> (Chord: (1,5))
- <0, 13, 14, 6> (Chord: (13, 14))
- <0, 4, 8, 10> (Chord: (4, 8))
- <0, 4, 5, 11> (Chord: (5, 11))
- <0, 3, 9, 10> (Chord: (3, 9))
- <0, 3, 8, 12> (Chord: (8, 12))
- <0, 2, 14, 13> (Chord: (2, 14))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
