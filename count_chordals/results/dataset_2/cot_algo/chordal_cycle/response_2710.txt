Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 1-9-2-6-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-9-2-6-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-9-2-7-0-3-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-2-7-0-4-1
- Cycle 5: 1-9-2-7-8-1
- Cycle 6: 1-9-2-7-8-4-1
- Cycle 7: 1-9-2-6-8-7-1
- Cycle 8: 1-9-2-7-8-6-1
- Cycle 9: 3-0-7-8-6-4-3
- Cycle 10: 3-0-7-8-1-3
- Cycle 11: 6-8-7-0-3-5-6
- Cycle 12: 6-8-7-0-4-6

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (2, 6) 
- Cycle 2 has a chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has a chord (0, 4)
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has a chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (0, 8)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (0, 1)
- Cycle 11 has no chord
- Cycle 12 has no chord

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we see that there are [6] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (2, 6), 4)>
<1, (2, 8), 6)>
<1, 9, 2, 7, 0, 4, 1)>
<1, (6, 8), 1)>
<3, (0, 8), 4)>
<3, (0, 1), 7)>
