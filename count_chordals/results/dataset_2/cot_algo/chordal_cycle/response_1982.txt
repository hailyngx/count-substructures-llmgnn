Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 17) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 0) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 3) (16, 17) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 16) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 18) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (0, 19) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <3, 15, 19, 11, 1> (Cycle with 5 nodes)
- <4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14> (Cycle with 6 nodes)
- <5, 3, 15, 19, 10> (Cycle with 5 nodes)
- <6, 5, 3, 15, 19> (Cycle with 5 nodes)
- <7, 4, 14, 13, 12, 9> (Cycle with 6 nodes)
- <8, 3, 15, 19, 10> (Cycle with 5 nodes)
- <9, 7, 14, 13, 12, 5> (Cycle with 6 nodes)
- <10, 5, 3, 15, 19> (Cycle with 5 nodes)
- <11, 19, 15, 3, 8> (Cycle with 5 nodes)
- <12, 5, 3, 15, 19> (Cycle with 5 nodes)
- <13, 10, 5, 3, 15> (Cycle with 5 nodes)
- <14, 4, 7, 9, 12, 13> (Cycle with 6 nodes)
- <15, 3, 8, 17, 16> (Cycle with 5 nodes)
- <16, 3, 15, 19, 10> (Cycle with 5 nodes)
- <17, 8, 9, 12, 13> (Cycle with 5 nodes)
- <18, 3, 15, 19, 10> (Cycle with 5 nodes)
- <19, 15, 17, 8, 3> (Cycle with 5 nodes)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <3, 15, 19, 11, 1> has one chord: (15, 17)
- <4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14> has one chord: (9, 12)
- <5, 3, 15, 19, 10> has one chord: (3, 10)
- <6, 5, 3, 15, 19> has one chord: (5, 15)
- <7, 4, 14, 13, 12, 9> has one chord: (4, 12)
- <8, 3, 15, 19, 10> has one chord: (3, 10)
- <9, 7, 14, 13, 12, 5> has one chord: (7, 13)
- <10, 5, 3, 15, 19> has one chord: (5, 15)
- <11, 19, 15, 3, 8> has one chord: (15, 3)
- <12, 5, 3, 15, 19> has one chord: (5, 15)
- <13, 10, 5, 3, 15> has one chord: (10, 15)
- <14, 4, 7, 9, 12, 13> has one chord: (7, 12)
- <15, 3, 8, 17, 16> has one chord: (8, 17)
- <16, 3, 15, 19, 10> has one chord: (3, 19)
- <17, 8, 9, 12, 13> has one chord: (8, 13)
- <18, 3, 15, 19, 10> has one chord: (3, 19)
- <19, 15, 17, 8, 3> has one chord: (15, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [16].
