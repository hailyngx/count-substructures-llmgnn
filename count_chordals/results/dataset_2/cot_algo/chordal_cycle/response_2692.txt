Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 13, 5, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 5, 13, 9, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 1, 11, 4, 8, 9, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 1, 2, 5, 13, 9, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 1, 2, 10, 0, 9, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 14, 11, 4, 7, 0, 9, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 14, 10, 0, 9, 12, 4, 11, 1, 6)
- Cycle 8: (9, 8, 4, 7, 0, 13, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 8, 4, 11, 1, 2, 10, 12, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 13, 0, 7, 4, 12, 10, 2, 5, 9)
- Cycle 11: (4, 7, 0, 13, 9, 12, 10, 2, 1, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 8, 3, 14, 10, 12, 7, 0, 9, 4)
- Cycle 13: (7, 0, 10, 12, 4, 11, 14, 3, 8, 7)
- Cycle 14: (8, 3, 14, 10, 2, 1, 11, 4, 12, 8)
- Cycle 15: (13, 0, 10, 12, 9, 8, 4, 11, 14, 13)
- Cycle 16: (12, 10, 2, 1, 11, 14, 3, 8, 4, 12)
- Cycle 17: (5, 2, 1, 11, 14, 6)
- Cycle 18: (0, 10, 12, 9, 6)
- Cycle 19: (14, 11, 4, 8, 3, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 6, 9, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, 5, 6, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 6, 9, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 6, 9, 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
