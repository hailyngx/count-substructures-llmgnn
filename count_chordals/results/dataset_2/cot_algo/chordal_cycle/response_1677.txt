17. (15, 18, 19, 1, 7)
18. (9, 11, 10, 12, 5)
19. (9, 0, 1, 7, 6)
20. (12, 10, 11, 5, 3)
21. (18, 19, 16, 8, 2)
22. (18, 15, 6, 7, 10)
23. (18, 16, 8, 2, 3)
24. (6, 7, 10, 12, 5)
25. (6, 15, 18, 13, 4)
26. (6, 13, 4, 2, 3)
27. (16, 8, 2, 3, 11)
28. (0, 1, 7, 10, 11)
29. (13, 4, 2, 3, 9)
30. (13, 18, 19, 1, 0)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<4, (2, 3), (11, 5)>
<7, (1, 19), (16, 8)>
<7, (10, 12), (11, 5)>
<7, (10, 11), (5, 12)>
<7, (14, 17), (14, 7)>
<10, (11, 5), (12, 10)>
<10, (11, 9), (0, 1)>
<11, (5, 12), (10, 11)>
<11, (9, 0), (1, 7)>
<1, (19, 16), (8, 2)>
<1, (7, 10), (11, 5)>
<1, (7, 6), (15, 18)>
<1, (0, 9), (11, 5)>
<15, (6, 7), (10, 11)>
<15, (6, 13), (18, 19)>
<15, (18, 19), (1, 7)>
<9, (11, 10), (12, 5)>
<9, (0, 1), (7, 6)>
<12, (10, 11), (5, 3)>
<18, (19, 16), (8, 2)>
<18, (15, 6), (7, 10)>
<18, (16, 8), (2, 3)>
<6, (7, 10), (12, 5)>
<6, (15, 18), (13, 4)>
<6, (13, 4), (2, 3)>
<16, (8, 2), (3, 11)>
<0, (1, 7), (10, 11)>
<13, (4, 2), (3, 9)>
<13, (18, 19), (1, 0)>

Step 3:
There are [30] chordless cycles found in the graph.
