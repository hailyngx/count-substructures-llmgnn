Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 17) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 18) (7, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 6) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 1) (0, 7) (0, 19) (15, 1) (15, 5) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 19) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 14) (18, 8) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 19) (19, 0) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 10) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 10) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (6, 1, 17, 4, 13, 3, 12, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 1, 17, 8, 18, 9, 14, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 14, 9, 18, 8, 17, 1, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 14, 3, 13, 4, 17, 1, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 19, 0, 7, 1, 17, 4, 13, 3, 14, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 19, 2, 9, 14, 3, 13, 16, 11, 5, 15, 1, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 19, 2, 9, 18, 8, 17, 4, 13, 3, 14, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 19, 10, 4, 13, 3, 14, 9, 18, 8, 17, 1, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, 1, 17, 4, 13, 3, 12, 6> (Chord: (1, 4))
- <6, 1, 17, 8, 18, 9, 14, 6> (Chord: (9, 8))
- <6, 14, 9, 18, 8, 17, 1, 6> (Chord: (8, 1))
- <6, 14, 3, 13, 4, 17, 1, 6> (Chord: (13, 1))
- <6, 19, 0, 7, 1, 17, 4, 13, 3, 14, 6> (Chord: (1, 14))
- <6, 19, 10, 4, 13, 3, 14, 9, 18, 8, 17, 1, 6> (Chord: (13, 9))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
