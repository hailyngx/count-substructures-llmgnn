Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-4-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-4-7-0
- Cycle 4: 0-2-6-7-0
- Cycle 5: 0-4-7-6-0
- Cycle 6: 1-0-4-7-1
- Cycle 7: 2-0-4-7-2
- Cycle 8: 3-6-7-4-3
- Cycle 9: 3-6-7-5-3
- Cycle 10: 4-0-1-4
- Cycle 11: 4-0-2-6-4
- Cycle 12: 4-1-0-7-4
- Cycle 13: 4-1-0-2-4
- Cycle 14: 4-2-0-7-4
- Cycle 15: 4-2-6-7-4
- Cycle 16: 4-7-0-1-4
- Cycle 17: 4-7-6-2-4
- Cycle 18: 5-7-9-8-5

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (0, 2)> has one chord (0, 2)
- <2, (0, 7)> has one chord (0, 7)
- <3, (2, 6)> has one chord (2, 6)
- <4, (6, 7)> has one chord (6, 7)
- <5, (4, 1)> has one chord (4, 1)
- <6, (0, 2)> has one chord (0, 2)
- <7, (0, 7)> has one chord (0, 7)
- <8, (4, 7)> has one chord (4, 7)
- <9, (3, 5)> has one chord (3, 5)
- <10, (0, 2)> has one chord (0, 2)
- <11, (0, 6)> has one chord (0, 6)
- <12, (1, 4)> has one chord (1, 4)
- <13, (0, 2)> has one chord (0, 2)
- <14, (2, 7)> has one chord (2, 7)
- <15, (1, 7)> has one chord (1, 7)
- <16, (2, 6)> has one chord (2, 6)
- <17, (1, 7)> has one chord (1, 7)
- <18, (4, 2)> has one chord (4, 2)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
- There are 18 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
