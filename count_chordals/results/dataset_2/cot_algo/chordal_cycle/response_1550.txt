Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 4) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (15, 18) (15, 17) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 18) (19, 11) (19, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (18, 16) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 5) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 5) (17, 12) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 17) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 0) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycle (1, 3, 5, 2) with edges (1, 3), (3, 5), (5, 2), (2, 1)
- The cycle (6, 9, 14, 13) with edges (6, 9), (9, 14), (14, 13), (13, 6)
- The cycle (8, 17, 12, 19) with edges (8, 17), (17, 12), (12, 19), (19, 8)
- The cycle (16, 4, 0, 6) with edges (16, 4), (4, 0), (0, 6), (6, 16)

Step 2:
- The cycle (1, 3, 5, 2) has one chord: (3, 2), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- The cycle (6, 9, 14, 13) has one chord: (9, 13), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- The cycle (16, 4, 0, 6) has one chord: (4, 6), making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, which are as follows:
- <1, (3, 2), 5, 2)>
- <6, (9, 13), 14, 13)>
- <16, (4, 6), 0, 6)>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
