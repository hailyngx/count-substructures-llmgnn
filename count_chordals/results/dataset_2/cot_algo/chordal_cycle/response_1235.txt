Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 7) (4, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (7, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (10, 17) (10, 0) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 16) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 18) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 13) (3, 13) (11, 4) (11, 13) (1, 6) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 11) (19, 8) (19, 9) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 9) (18, 15) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 12) (9, 19) (9, 18) (15, 18) (15, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle 1: 0 - 2 - 5 - 6 - 0
2. Cycle 2: 0 - 2 - 12 - 15 - 0
3. Cycle 3: 4 - 7 - 0 - 14 - 4
4. Cycle 4: 4 - 11 - 13 - 2 - 4
5. Cycle 5: 4 - 8 - 16 - 6 - 4
6. Cycle 6: 6 - 5 - 2 - 0 - 6
7. Cycle 7: 6 - 16 - 8 - 4 - 6
8. Cycle 8: 7 - 17 - 10 - 0 - 7
9. Cycle 9: 16 - 14 - 4 - 8 - 16
10. Cycle 10: 18 - 8 - 4 - 7 - 18

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has the chord (4, 2).
- Cycle 5 has the chord (8, 6).
- Cycle 6 has no chords.
- Cycle 7 has the chord (16, 4).
- Cycle 8 has no chords.
- Cycle 9 has the chord (8, 4).
- Cycle 10 has no chords.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found. 

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <4, (4, 2), 13, 11>
2. <6, (8, 6), 16, 4>
3. <7, (16, 4), 14, 8>
4. <10, (8, 4), 7, 18>
