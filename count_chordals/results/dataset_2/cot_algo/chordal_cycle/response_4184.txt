Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 16) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 15) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 16) (1, 14) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 1) (8, 19) (8, 3) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 9) (2, 1) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 13) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 1) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are two chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are as follows:
<10, 9, 14, 13> with chord (9, 14)
<17, 16, 19, 3> with chord (16, 19)

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
