Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-2-13-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-14-4-0
- Cycle 3: 1-6-14-10-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-5-7-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-9-2-1
- Cycle 6: 2-5-14-10-2
- Cycle 7: 2-9-3-12-2
- Cycle 8: 3-7-11-12-3
- Cycle 9: 4-8-11-13-4
- Cycle 10: 5-6-14-2-5
- Cycle 11: 5-7-0-2-5
- Cycle 12: 6-9-2-1-6
- Cycle 13: 7-5-0-2-7
- Cycle 14: 8-0-13-11-8
- Cycle 15: 10-14-2-1-10
- Cycle 16: 10-14-4-13-10

Step 2:
Checking the cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-2-13-0 has a chord (5, 13)
- Cycle 2: 0-5-14-4-0 has a chord (5, 4)
- Cycle 3: 1-6-14-10-1 has a chord (6, 10)
- Cycle 4: 1-6-5-7-1 has a chord (6, 7)
- Cycle 5: 1-6-9-2-1 has a chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 6: 2-5-14-10-2 has a chord (5, 10)
- Cycle 7: 2-9-3-12-2 has a chord (9, 3)
- Cycle 8: 3-7-11-12-3 has a chord (7, 11)
- Cycle 9: 4-8-11-13-4 has a chord (8, 13)
- Cycle 10: 5-6-14-2-5 has a chord (6, 14)
- Cycle 12: 6-9-2-1-6 has a chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 14: 8-0-13-11-8 has a chord (0, 11)
- Cycle 15: 10-14-2-1-10 has a chord (14, 1)
- Cycle 16: 10-14-4-13-10 has a chord (14, 13)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 2

Putting the final number inside brackets: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, (5, 13), 2>
<14, (5, 4), 0>
