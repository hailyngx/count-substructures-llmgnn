Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 17) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 17) (11, 15) (8, 15) (13, 12) (13, 18) (6, 17) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 16) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 1) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 14) (16, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 16) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 6) (2, 14) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 12) (18, 13) (18, 12) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 5-0-12-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-3-7-4-5
- Cycle 3: 5-19-10-1-14-2-16-3-5
- Cycle 4: 9-17-11-10-9
- Cycle 5: 9-16-7-4-12-13-18-9
- Cycle 6: 4-15-8-15-4
- Cycle 7: 4-15-11-17-9-16-14-7-4
- Cycle 8: 4-19-10-9-17-11-15-4
- Cycle 9: 4-7-14-1-10-11-17-6-3-4
- Cycle 10: 4-7-16-9-17-6-3-4
- Cycle 11: 7-3-0-12-13-18-7
- Cycle 12: 7-16-9-17-11-15-8-15-4-7
- Cycle 13: 10-1-14-2-16-9-17-11-10
- Cycle 14: 10-19-4-15-8-15-11-17-9-10
- Cycle 15: 11-10-1-14-7-16-9-17-15-11
- Cycle 16: 12-4-7-14-16-3-6-17-11-12
- Cycle 17: 12-13-18-12
- Cycle 18: 14-2-16-9-17-6-3-0-5-19-14
- Cycle 19: 16-14-7-4-19-5-0-3-16
- Cycle 20: 16-3-0-12-13-18-12-1-10-19-16
- Cycle 21: 19-5-0-12-13-18-9-17-11-15-4-19

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, (10, 19), 4, 15, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, (1, 14), 7, 16, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 19 chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
