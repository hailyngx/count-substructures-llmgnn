Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-4-7-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-8-2-9-7-5
- Cycle 3: 3-5-7-4-3
- Cycle 4: 2-1-4-7-2

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 2 has chord (8, 9)
- Cycle 3 has chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 4 has chord (1, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (5, 7), 6)>
<2, (8, 9), 5)>
<3, (4, 7), 5)>
<4, (1, 7), 2)>
