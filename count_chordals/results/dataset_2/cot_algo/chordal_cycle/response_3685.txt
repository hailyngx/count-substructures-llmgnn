Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 2) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (1, 17) (1, 9) (0, 4) (0, 17) (5, 11) (5, 19) (19, 7) (19, 5) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 18) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 8) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 6) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 2) (13, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (9, 4, 13, 3)
- Cycle 2: (9, 4, 6, 2, 13)
- Cycle 3: (9, 4, 6, 8, 16, 10)
- Cycle 4: (9, 4, 6, 2, 13, 18)
- Cycle 5: (4, 6, 2, 13, 3)
- Cycle 6: (4, 6, 12, 15, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 6, 8, 16, 10)
- Cycle 8: (4, 6, 2, 13, 18)
- Cycle 9: (4, 13, 18, 11)
- Cycle 10: (4, 13, 18, 16, 10)

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
<9, 4, (13, 3)>
<9, 4, (6, 2), 13>
<9, 4, (6, 8), 16, 10>
<9, 4, (6, 2), 13, 18>
<4, 6, 2, (13, 3)>
<4, 6, (12, 15), 9>
<4, 6, (8, 16), 10>
<4, 6, 2, (13, 18)>
<4, 13, 18, (11, 10)>
<4, 13, (18, 16), 10>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are [10] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
