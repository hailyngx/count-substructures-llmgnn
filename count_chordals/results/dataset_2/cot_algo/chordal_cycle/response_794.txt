Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-9-6-4
- Cycle 2: 4-7-2-1-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 2 has one chord (4, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are <4, (4, 9), 9, 6)> and <4, (4, 2), 2, 1)>.
