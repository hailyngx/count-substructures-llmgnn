Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 5-9-4-8-5
2. Cycle 2: 5-6-8-2-5
3. Cycle 3: 5-2-4-9-5
4. Cycle 4: 5-1-4-9-5
5. Cycle 5: 5-3-9-4-5
6. Cycle 6: 9-4-1-5-9
7. Cycle 7: 9-3-0-6-9
8. Cycle 8: 4-8-6-2-4
9. Cycle 9: 8-6-0-3-8
10. Cycle 10: 6-2-8-4-6
11. Cycle 11: 2-8-6-0-2
12. Cycle 12: 0-6-2-8-0
13. Cycle 13: 1-4-9-5-1
14. Cycle 14: 7-1-5-2-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. Cycle 1: 5-9-4-8-5 (Chord: 9-8)
2. Cycle 2: 5-6-8-2-5 (Chord: 6-2)
3. Cycle 3: 5-2-4-9-5 (Chord: 2-9)
4. Cycle 4: 5-1-4-9-5 (Chord: 1-9)
5. Cycle 5: 5-3-9-4-5 (Chord: 3-4)
6. Cycle 8: 4-8-6-2-4 (Chord: 8-6)
7. Cycle 10: 6-2-8-4-6 (Chord: 2-8)
8. Cycle 13: 1-4-9-5-1 (Chord: 4-5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found inside []: [8].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<5, 9, 8, 4>
<5, 6, 8, 2>
<5, 2, 4, 9>
<5, 1, 4, 9>
<5, 3, 9, 4>
<4, 8, 6, 2>
<6, 2, 8, 4>
<1, 4, 9, 5>
