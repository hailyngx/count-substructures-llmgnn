Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 7) (22, 2) (22, 11) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 21) (1, 14) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 14) (26, 5) (26, 28) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 27) (28, 23) (6, 21) (6, 3) (6, 18) (7, 13) (7, 25) (7, 0) (25, 7) (25, 10) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 11) (24, 23) (24, 29) (24, 20) (10, 13) (10, 25) (10, 29) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 20) (29, 24) (29, 10) (29, 11) (27, 28) (27, 17) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (17, 27) (17, 8) (8, 17) (8, 14) (14, 1) (14, 21) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 20) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 23) (23, 28) (23, 24) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 23) (4, 11) (19, 14) (19, 20) (15, 0) (15, 16) (20, 24) (20, 3) (20, 14) (20, 19) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 29) (11, 4) (12, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

These are the cycles found in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: 13-4-23-28-26-5-9-3-6-21-1-14-19-20-24-29-10-25-7       (Length: 18)
- Cycle 2: 22-2-5-9-3-28-27-17-8-14-19-20-24-29-10-25-7-0-15-16   (Length: 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Checking for a single chord in Cycle 1: 
- Chord 1: (13, 23)           <13, (23), 5>
- Chord 2: (26, 9)             <26, (9), 3>
- Chord 3: (28, 6)             <28, (6), 21>
- Chord 4: (24, 10)            <24, (10), 29>
- Chord 5: (25, 14)            <25, (14), 1>
- Chord 6: (20, 19)            <20, (19), 14>

Checking for a single chord in Cycle 2: 
- Chord 1: (22, 28)            <22, (28), 27>
- Chord 2: (8, 17)             <8, (17), 27>
- Chord 3: (14, 19)            <14, (19), 20>
- Chord 4: (24, 10)            <24, (10), 29>
- Chord 5: (25, 16)            <25, (16), 15>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, therefore the count is [0].
