Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph of length 4 or more:  
- Cycle 1: (5, 2, 8, 11)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 9, 6)
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 13, 6)
- Cycle 4: (2, 8, 12, 0)
- Cycle 5: (2, 8, 11, 14)
- Cycle 6: (2, 1, 4, 6)
- Cycle 7: (2, 1, 11, 14)
- Cycle 8: (5, 14, 12, 8)
- Cycle 9: (5, 14, 11, 1)
- Cycle 10: (7, 5, 13, 6)
- Cycle 11: (7, 9, 11, 14)
- Cycle 12: (7, 3, 0, 10)
- Cycle 13: (9, 7, 13, 6)
- Cycle 14: (9, 11, 14, 5)
  
Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for a single chord:
- Cycle 1: <5, (8, 11), 2>
- Cycle 2: <7, (9, 6), 5>
- Cycle 3: <2, (5, 13), 6>
- Cycle 4: <2, (8, 12), 0>
- Cycle 5: <2, (8, 11), 14>
- Cycle 6: <2, (1, 4), 6>
- Cycle 7: <2, (1, 11), 14>
- Cycle 8: <5, (14, 12), 8>
- Cycle 9: <5, (14, 11), 1>
- Cycle 10: <7, (13, 6), 5>
- Cycle 11: <7, (9, 11), 14>
- Cycle 12: <7, (3, 0), 10>
- Cycle 13: <9, (7, 13), 6>
- Cycle 14: <9, (11, 14), 5>
  
Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [14].
