Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: {4, 7, 3, 4}
- Cycle 2: {4, 7, 5, 4}
- Cycle 3: {4, 6, 9, 4}
- Cycle 4: {4, 6, 2, 4}
- Cycle 5: {7, 4, 3, 7}
- Cycle 6: {7, 4, 5, 7}
- Cycle 7: {7, 9, 6, 7}
- Cycle 8: {3, 7, 0, 3}
- Cycle 9: {3, 4, 5, 3}
- Cycle 10: {6, 4, 7, 6}
- Cycle 11: {6, 9, 2, 6}
- Cycle 12: {9, 7, 1, 9}
- Cycle 13: {9, 1, 5, 9}
- Cycle 14: {8, 7, 1, 8}
- Cycle 15: {5, 7, 4, 5}
- Cycle 16: {2, 6, 4, 2}
- Cycle 17: {2, 9, 6, 2}
- Cycle 18: {0, 7, 4, 0}
- Cycle 19: {0, 3, 8, 0}

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
- <1, (7, 3, 8), 4>
- <2, (6, 9), 4>
- <3, (4, 5), 7>
- <4, (4, 6), 7>
- <5, (6, 9), 2>
- <6, (9, 1), 7>
- <7, (1, 5), 9>
- <8, (1, 7), 8>
- <9, (4, 5), 7>
- <10, (6, 9), 2>
- <11, (7, 5), 4>
- <12, (7, 9), 1>
- <13, (7, 1), 8>
- <14, (4, 3), 7>
- <15, (2, 6), 4>
- <16, (0, 7), 4>
- <17, (0, 3), 8>

Step 3: 
There are 17 unique chordal 4-cycles found. 
Therefore, the final count is [17].
