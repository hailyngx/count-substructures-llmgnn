Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 8 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 0 - 4 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 9 - 8 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 2 - 1 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 0 - 4 - 7 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 8 - 1 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 7: 4 - 7 - 1 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 8: 4 - 6 - 3 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 9: 7 - 1 - 5 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 10: 1 - 3 - 4 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 11: 8 - 2 - 5 - 6 - 8
- Cycle 12: 6 - 4 - 0 - 3 - 6

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (8, 9), 5>
- Cycle 2: <2, (9, 4), 6>
- Cycle 3: <3, (9, 8), 5>
- Cycle 4: <4, (1, 7), 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, (4, 7), 9>
- Cycle 6: <6, (1, 3), 9>
- Cycle 7: <7, (1, 3), 4>
- Cycle 8: <8, (0, 4), 6>
- Cycle 9: <9, (1, 5), 7>
- Cycle 10: <10, (0, 4), 1>
- Cycle 11: <11, (8, 5), 6>
- Cycle 12: <12, (0, 3), 4>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is 12.
Therefore, the final answer is [12].
