Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 16) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 1) (6, 14) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 12) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (8, 14) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 16) (16, 15) (16, 0) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 10) (11, 19) (11, 4) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 2, 12, 3)
- Cycle 2: (14, 6, 9, 12, 14)
- Cycle 3: (17, 1, 13, 3, 17)
- Cycle 4: (2, 18, 0, 1, 2)
- Cycle 5: (1, 10, 5, 0, 1)
- Cycle 6: (0, 9, 6, 14, 0)
- Cycle 7: (15, 2, 18, 7, 15)
- Cycle 8: (19, 11, 4, 2, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1: <1, (2, 12), 3>
- Cycle 2: <4, (6, 12), 14>
- Cycle 3: <13, (1, 3), 17>
- Cycle 4: <0, (1, 18), 2>
- Cycle 5: <5, (0, 10), 1>
- Cycle 6: <5, (6, 14), 9>
- Cycle 7: <7, (2, 18), 15>
- Cycle 8: <11, (2, 4), 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are a total of 8 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, therefore the final count is [8].
