Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 21) (5, 16) (9, 21) (9, 28) (1, 3) (1, 25) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 20) (3, 18) (7, 0) (7, 26) (7, 13) (7, 17) (21, 5) (21, 9) (21, 19) (21, 26) (10, 17) (10, 23) (17, 7) (17, 10) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 15) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 25) (2, 23) (2, 12) (2, 19) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 24) (18, 12) (29, 24) (0, 5) (0, 7) (22, 26) (22, 27) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 22) (26, 15) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 27) (27, 22) (27, 25) (27, 20) (27, 6) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 4) (19, 21) (19, 2) (6, 27) (6, 24) (6, 13) (6, 16) (24, 18) (24, 29) (24, 6) (24, 16) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 24) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 11) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 6) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 27) (20, 14) (20, 28) (28, 9) (28, 20) (14, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. (5, 21, 9, 28)
2. (3, 1, 25, 27)
3. (7, 17, 10, 23)
4. (8, 23, 2, 19)
5. (18, 3, 11, 15)
6. (26, 21, 19, 2)
7. (6, 27, 25, 1)
8. (4, 12, 2, 19)
9. (24, 18, 12, 4)
10. (16, 5, 21, 19)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <5, 21, (9, 28), 9>
2. <3, 1, (25, 27), 25>
3. <7, 17, (10, 23), 10>
4. <8, 23, (2, 19), 2>
5. <18, 3, (11, 15), 11>
6. <26, 21, (19, 2), 19>
7. <6, 27, (25, 1), 25>
8. <4, 12, (2, 19), 2>
9. <24, 18, (12, 4), 12>
10. <16, 5, (21, 19), 21>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [10].
