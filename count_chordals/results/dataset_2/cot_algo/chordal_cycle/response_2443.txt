Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph. Let's list them out:
1. Cycle: 5-9-4-7-5
2. Cycle: 5-3-4-7-5
3. Cycle: 5-7-4-1-5
4. Cycle: 9-4-7-2-9
5. Cycle: 9-1-4-7-9
6. Cycle: 4-7-2-1-4
7. Cycle: 4-1-9-2-4
8. Cycle: 4-6-3-5-4
9. Cycle: 3-4-7-2-3
10. Cycle: 7-4-1-9-7
11. Cycle: 7-2-9-1-7
12. Cycle: 1-9-2-7-1
13. Cycle: 2-7-8-6-2
14. Cycle: 2-1-4-3-2
15. Cycle: 2-3-6-0-2
16. Cycle: 8-7-2-1-8
17. Cycle: 8-2-9-4-8
18. Cycle: 8-6-3-2-8
19. Cycle: 0-7-4-6-0
20. Cycle: 6-3-4-7-6

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges) are:
1. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (9, 4), 7>
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (3, 7), 4>
3. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (7, 1), 4>
4. Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (4, 7), 2>
5. Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (1, 7), 4>
6. Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (7, 2), 1>
7. Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (1, 9), 7>
8. Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (6, 3), 7>
9. Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (4, 7), 2>
10. Chordal 4-cycle: <7, (4, 1), 9>
11. Chordal 4-cycle: <7, (2, 9), 1>
12. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (9, 2), 7>
13. Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (7, 8), 6>
14. Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (1, 4), 3>
15. Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (3, 6), 0>
16. Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (7, 2), 1>
17. Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (2, 9), 4>
18. Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (6, 3), 2>
19. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (7, 4), 6>
20. Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (3, 4), 7>

Step 3:
There are 20 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. 
Therefore, the total number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [20].
