Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (4, 5) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 18) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (14, 3) (14, 5) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 10) (9, 2) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 9) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 18) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <11, 16, 7, 2> (4-cycle)
- <11, 16, 2, 13> (4-cycle)
- <11, 17, 1, 3> (4-cycle)
- <11, 17, 3, 14> (4-cycle)
- <11, 0, 15, 10> (4-cycle)
- <11, 0, 18, 12> (4-cycle)
- <11, 13, 2, 16> (4-cycle)
- <16, 7, 19, 1> (4-cycle)
- <16, 7, 2, 13> (4-cycle)
- <16, 2, 13, 11> (4-cycle)
- <4, 5, 12, 18> (4-cycle)
- <7, 2, 13, 11> (4-cycle)
- <7, 19, 15, 0> (4-cycle)
- <1, 3, 17, 11> (4-cycle)
- <1, 3, 6, 19> (4-cycle)
- <1, 17, 11, 16> (4-cycle)
- <3, 6, 8, 10> (4-cycle)
- <3, 14, 5, 12> (4-cycle)
- <17, 11, 0, 18> (4-cycle)
- <10, 15, 19, 7> (4-cycle)
- <10, 15, 0, 11> (4-cycle)
- <10, 9, 2, 16> (4-cycle)
- <15, 0, 18, 12> (4-cycle)
- <13, 2, 7, 16> (4-cycle)
- <12, 5, 4, 14> (4-cycle)
- <19, 7, 16, 11> (4-cycle)
- <19, 1, 17, 11> (4-cycle)
- <5, 4, 14, 3> (4-cycle)
- <5, 14, 3, 1> (4-cycle)
- <5, 12, 18, 0> (4-cycle)
- <8, 6, 3, 1> (4-cycle)
- <14, 5, 4, 12> (4-cycle)
- <0, 11, 17, 3> (4-cycle)
- <0, 15, 19, 1> (4-cycle)
- <9, 10, 15, 0> (4-cycle)
- <9, 2, 13, 11> (4-cycle)
- <2, 16, 11, 0> (4-cycle)
- <6, 3, 1, 17> (4-cycle)
- <18, 12, 5, 14> (4-cycle)

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <11, 16, 7, 2> with chord <16, 2>
- <11, 17, 1, 3> with chord <17, 1>
- <11, 0, 15, 10> with chord <0, 15>
- <11, 0, 18, 12> with chord <0, 18>
- <4, 5, 12, 18> with chord <5, 12>
- <1, 3, 6, 19> with chord <3, 19>
- <3, 6, 8, 10> with chord <6, 10>
- <10, 9, 2, 16> with chord <9, 16>
- <5, 4, 14, 3> with chord <4, 14>
- <8, 6, 3, 1> with chord <6, 1>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have: [29]
