Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 2) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 24) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 18) (17, 13) (17, 18) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 28) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 29) (12, 3) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (14, 0) (14, 29) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 20) (28, 23) (26, 1) (26, 2) (26, 20) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 27) (13, 17) (13, 24) (13, 27) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 2) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 3) (22, 16) (22, 19) (22, 3) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 19) (15, 25) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 22) (29, 7) (29, 12) (29, 14) (29, 5) (29, 11) (5, 23) (5, 29) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 16) (20, 6) (20, 26) (20, 27) (25, 15) (24, 21) (24, 13) (11, 8) (11, 29) (27, 9) (27, 13) (27, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
1. Cycle <1, 21, 24, 13>
2. Cycle <4, 23, 28, 5>
3. Cycle <7, 12, 3, 22>
4. Cycle <8, 1, 21, 24>
5. Cycle <9, 21, 24, 13>
6. Cycle <16, 4, 23, 28>
7. Cycle <16, 8, 1, 21>
8. Cycle <16, 8, 9, 27>
9. Cycle <16, 0, 14, 29>
10. Cycle <19, 4, 23, 28>
11. Cycle <19, 6, 15, 25>
12. Cycle <19, 15, 0, 14>
13. Cycle <19, 3, 12, 7>
14. Cycle <19, 22, 3, 12>
15. Cycle <22, 16, 4, 23>
16. Cycle <22, 16, 8, 1>
17. Cycle <22, 3, 12, 7> 

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle is:
<16, 4, 23, 28> with non-adjacent chords (16, 23)

Step 3:
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
