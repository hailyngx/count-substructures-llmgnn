Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 7, 5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 10, 14, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 3, 5, 7, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 3, 11, 10, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 5, 7, 12, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 9, 2, 3, 0)
- Cycle 7: (1, 7, 12, 6, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 8, 2, 4, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 8, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 10, 11, 3, 1)
- Cycle 11: (2, 3, 5, 7, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 6, 4, 14, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 8, 5, 3, 2)
- Cycle 14: (3, 5, 7, 13, 3)
- Cycle 15: (4, 6, 12, 7, 4)
- Cycle 16: (4, 14, 13, 11, 4)
- Cycle 17: (5, 7, 12, 9, 5)
- Cycle 18: (5, 8, 2, 9, 5)
- Cycle 19: (6, 12, 7, 13, 6)
- Cycle 20: (6, 13, 11, 3, 6)
- Cycle 21: (7, 12, 6, 4, 7)
- Cycle 22: (9, 2, 8, 5, 9)
- Cycle 23: (10, 1, 7, 12, 10)
- Cycle 24: (10, 11, 13, 14, 10)
- Cycle 25: (11, 3, 0, 9, 11)
- Cycle 26: (13, 7, 5, 3, 13)
- Cycle 27: (14, 10, 1, 8, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (1, 7), 5)> with chord (1, 7)
- <2, (2, 6), 4)> with chord (2, 6)
- <3, (3, 11), 10)> with chord (3, 11)
- <3, (3, 7), 5)> with chord (3, 7)
- <4, (4, 12), 7)> with chord (4, 12)
- <4, (4, 13), 11)> with chord (4, 13)
- <5, (5, 9), 2)> with chord (5, 9)
- <6, (6, 13), 3)> with chord (6, 13)
- <7, (7, 6), 12)> with chord (7, 6)
- <8, (8, 2), 5)> with chord (8, 2)
- <10, (10, 14), 1)> with chord (10, 14)
- <10, (10, 0), 3)> with chord (10, 0)
- <13, (13, 4), 7)> with chord (13, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.
There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
