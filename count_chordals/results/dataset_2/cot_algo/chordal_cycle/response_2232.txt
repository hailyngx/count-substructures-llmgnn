Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 15) (16, 3) (16, 9) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (10, 5) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 15) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (18, 17) (18, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 5) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 1) (2, 14) (2, 9) (12, 14) (12, 10) (3, 16) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 1) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 7) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 19) (1, 5) (1, 9) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
In this graph, the chordal 4-cycles are as follows:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- <0, 7, 15, 4, 19>
- <0, 7, 5, 8, 19>
- <0, 3, 16, 9, 11>
- <1, 9, 2, 14, 12>
- <1, 5, 7, 0, 3>
- <2, 14, 19, 1, 5>
- <4, 17, 14, 12, 10>
- <4, 15, 8, 19, 14>
- <5, 11, 15, 7, 0>
- <5, 7, 0, 3, 16>
- <5, 8, 19, 14, 17>
- <6, 17, 14, 12, 10>
- <9, 11, 5, 1, 19>
- <9, 16, 3, 0, 7>
- <9, 10, 12, 14, 2>
- <13, 18, 17, 14, 12>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 7, 15, 4, 19> has one chord (4, 15)
- <4, 17, 14, 12, 10> has one chord (14, 10)
- <9, 16, 3, 0, 7> has one chord (3, 7)
- <13, 18, 17, 14, 12> has one chord (17, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [4].
