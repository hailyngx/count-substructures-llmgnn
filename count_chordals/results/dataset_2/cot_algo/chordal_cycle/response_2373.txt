Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-1-8-4-0 (length 4)
        - Cycle 2: 0-1-8-3-2-0 (length 5)
        - Cycle 3: 0-1-8-6-4-0 (length 5)
        - Cycle 4: 0-5-4-8-0 (length 4)
        - Cycle 5: 0-5-4-9-7-0 (length 5)
        - Cycle 6: 0-5-4-6-3-2-0 (length 6)
        - Cycle 7: 0-5-2-3-8-0 (length 5)
        - Cycle 8: 0-9-4-6-3-2-0 (length 6)
        - Cycle 9: 1-8-4-0-5-2-1 (length 6)
        - Cycle 10: 1-8-6-4-0-5-1 (length 6)
        - Cycle 11: 2-3-6-4-0-5-2 (length 6)
        - Cycle 12: 2-3-8-6-4-0-5-2 (length 7)
        - Cycle 13: 2-4-6-3-8-2 (length 5)
        - Cycle 14: 2-4-6-8-2 (length 4)
        - Cycle 15: 2-4-9-7-0-5-2 (length 6)
        - Cycle 16: 2-7-0-5-4-6-3-2 (length 7)
        - Cycle 17: 2-7-8-3-6-4-2 (length 6)
        - Cycle 18: 3-2-4-6-8-3 (length 5)
        - Cycle 19: 3-2-7-0-5-4-6-3 (length 7)
        - Cycle 20: 3-6-4-8-0-5-3 (length 6)
        - Cycle 21: 4-6-3-8-0-5-4 (length 6)
        - Cycle 22: 4-8-6-3-2-0-5-4 (length 7)
        - Cycle 23: 5-0-1-8-4-9-5 (length 6)
        - Cycle 24: 5-0-7-9-4-6-3-5 (length 7)
        - Cycle 25: 5-4-6-3-8-0-5 (length 6)
        - Cycle 26: 6-3-2-8-0-5-4-6 (length 7)
        - Cycle 27: 6-4-9-7-0-5-2-6 (length 7)
        - Cycle 28: 7-0-5-4-6-8-7 (length 6)
        - Cycle 29: 8-0-5-4-6-3-8 (length 6)
        - Cycle 30: 8-2-0-5-4-6-8 (length 6)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with one chord:
        - Cycles with exactly one chord are:
            - <1, (0, 5), 8>
            - <4, (5, 0), 9>
            - <6, (3, 8), 4>
            - <8, (5, 0), 2>
            - <10, (4, 9), 7>
            - <13, (3, 8), 6>
            - <15, (4, 9), 7>
            - <20, (8, 0), 3>
            - <22, (4, 9), 7>
            - <25, (0, 5), 4>
            - <26, (3, 2), 8>
            - <27, (5, 0), 2>
            - <28, (4, 6), 8>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        - There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Putting the final number inside brackets gives: [13].
