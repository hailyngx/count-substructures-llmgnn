The edges are as follows: (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 21) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 29) (23, 19) (1, 16) (26, 16) (26, 7) (26, 17) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 20) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 7) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 5) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 28) (20, 10) (28, 6) (28, 20) (28, 25) (3, 7) (3, 22) (21, 8) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 11) (19, 8) (19, 23) (19, 4) (19, 0) (2, 24) (2, 14) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 12) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 22) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 27) (25, 28) (25, 9) (25, 14) (0, 19) (0, 29) (16, 1) (16, 26) (7, 26) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 27) (11, 9) (11, 13) (13, 11) (13, 10) (29, 23) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 12) (24, 2) (24, 27) (24, 12) (24, 10) (27, 17) (27, 7) (27, 24) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 25) (10, 20) (10, 13) (10, 24) (10, 12) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 24) (12, 10) (18, 15) (18, 20) 

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. (8, 23, 29, 5, 20, 15)
2. (8, 23, 29, 12, 22, 3)
3. (8, 23, 14, 2, 24, 27)
4. (8, 19, 4, 22, 3, 7)
5. (8, 19, 4, 9, 25, 28)
6. (8, 19, 4, 22, 12, 10)
7. (23, 29, 0, 19, 8, 21)
8. (23, 29, 12, 24, 27, 17)
9. (23, 14, 25, 9, 19, 8)
10. (1, 16, 26, 7, 3, 22)
11. (5, 29, 0, 19, 8, 21)
12. (5, 6, 7, 3, 22, 4)
13. (5, 6, 28, 25, 14, 2)
14. (6, 5, 29, 0, 19, 8)
15. (6, 28, 25, 9, 8, 21)
16. (15, 20, 28, 25, 14, 2)
17. (15, 17, 26, 16, 1, 8)
18. (20, 28, 25, 14, 2, 24)
19. (20, 10, 12, 29, 0, 19)
20. (3, 22, 4, 19, 8, 9)
21. (21, 8, 19, 0, 29, 12)
22. (9, 4, 22, 12, 29, 0)
23. (9, 25, 28, 6, 5, 29)
24. (16, 1, 8, 19, 0, 29)
25. (7, 3, 22, 4, 9, 8)
26. (7, 26, 16, 1, 8, 21)
27. (25, 28, 6, 5, 29, 0)
28. (0, 19, 8, 23, 14, 25)
29. (27, 17, 26, 16, 1, 8)
30. (17, 15, 20, 28, 25, 14)

Next, let's identify the cycles with exactly one chord (4-cycle) and count the number of such chordal cycles:
1. <8, 23, 14, 25, 9>  [(1)]
2. <8, 23, 29, 0, 19>  [(2)]
3. <8, 19, 4, 22, 3>  [(3)]
4. <11, 9, 25, 28, 6>  [(4)]
5. <12, 29, 0, 19, 8>  [(5)]
6. <15, 20, 28, 25, 14>  [(6)]
7. <17, 26, 16, 1, 8>  [(7)]
8. <20, 10, 12, 29, 0>  [(8)]
9. <3, 22, 4, 19, 8>  [(9)]
10. <9, 25, 28, 6, 5>  [(10)] 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
