Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
1. Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 1 - 5
2. Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 7 - 5
3. Cycle 3: 9 - 1 - 11 - 9
4. Cycle 4: 4 - 7 - 6 - 4
5. Cycle 5: 10 - 11 - 1 - 10
6. Cycle 6: 13 - 8 - 2 - 13
7. Cycle 7: 12 - 5 - 10 - 12
8. Cycle 8: 0 - 9 - 1 - 0
9. Cycle 9: 14 - 9 - 4 - 14
10. Cycle 10: 2 - 7 - 6 - 2
11. Cycle 11: 6 - 14 - 4 - 6
12. Cycle 12: 3 - 7 - 6 - 3
13. Cycle 13: 3 - 13 - 8 - 3
14. Cycle 14: 12 - 3 - 13 - 12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
1. Cycle 1 does not have a chord.
2. Cycle 2 does not have a chord.
3. Cycle 3 does not have a chord.
4. Cycle 4 has a chord: Chord: (4, 14)
5. Cycle 5 does not have a chord.
6. Cycle 6 has a chord: Chord: (8, 2)
7. Cycle 7 does not have a chord.
8. Cycle 8 does not have a chord.
9. Cycle 9 does not have a chord.
10. Cycle 10 does not have a chord.
11. Cycle 11 does not have a chord.
12. Cycle 12 does not have a chord.
13. Cycle 13 does not have a chord.
14. Cycle 14 has a chord: Chord: (13, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 9 chordal 4-cycles in the graph: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 5, 9, 1>
<2, 13, 8, 2>
<4, 7, 6, 4>
<10, 11, 1, 10>
<6, 14, 4, 6>
<12, 3, 13, 12>
<5, 9, 1, 5>
<9, 1, 11, 9>
<3, 7, 6, 3>
