Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  

Cycles of length 4:
- (4, 9, 10, 4)
- (4, 9, 12, 4)
- (4, 8, 10, 4)
- (4, 8, 7, 4)
- (4, 11, 3, 4)
- (4, 11, 1, 4)
- (4, 2, 0, 4)

- (5, 6, 12, 9)
- (5, 6, 12, 7)
- (5, 6, 13, 12)
- (5, 8, 7, 6)
- (5, 8, 10, 4)
- (5, 8, 1, 6)

- (9, 4, 8, 5)
- (9, 4, 10, 8)
- (9, 4, 11, 3)
- (9, 4, 2, 0)
- (9, 10, 8, 5)
- (9, 10, 0, 2)
- (9, 12, 6, 5)
- (9, 12, 7, 8)

- (6, 12, 7, 8)
- (6, 12, 9, 4)
- (6, 13, 12, 9)
- (6, 13, 14, 1)
- (6, 1, 8, 5)

- (12, 9, 10, 4)
- (12, 9, 4, 8)
- (12, 7, 8, 5)
- (12, 7, 11, 4)
- (12, 13, 6, 5)
- (12, 13, 14, 1)
- (12, 0, 2, 4)
- (12, 0, 3, 11)
- (12, 11, 7, 8)

- (0, 12, 7, 8)
- (0, 2, 4, 9)
- (0, 2, 1, 6)
- (0, 2, 1, 14)
- (0, 10, 9, 4)
- (0, 10, 8, 5)
- (0, 3, 11, 4)
- (0, 3, 8, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- < (4, 9, 10, 4), (9, 10) >
- < (5, 8, 7, 6), (8, 7) >
- < (6, 12, 7, 8), (12, 7) >
- < (9, 12, 7, 8), (9, 12) >
- < (12, 13, 6, 5), (13, 6) >
- < (0, 2, 1, 6), (2, 1) >

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
