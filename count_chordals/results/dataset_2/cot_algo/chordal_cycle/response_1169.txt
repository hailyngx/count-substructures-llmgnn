Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 6) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 14) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 1) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 12) (19, 0) (19, 12) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 16) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (7, 16) (3, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 14) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 19) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (11, 18, 6, 12)
- Cycle 2: (5, 13, 9, 11)
- Cycle 3: (2, 6, 18, 11)
- Cycle 4: (5, 16, 0, 19)
- Cycle 5: (15, 12, 6, 2)
- Cycle 6: (1, 14, 4, 3)
- Cycle 7: (17, 1, 15, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1: <1, (11, 6), 5>
- Cycle 2: <2, (13, 9), 11>
- Cycle 3: <3, (6, 18), 11>
- Cycle 4: <4, (16, 0), 19>
- Cycle 5: <5, (15, 2), 6>
- Cycle 6: <6, (1, 14), 3>
- Cycle 7: <7, (17, 1), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number inside brackets is [7].
