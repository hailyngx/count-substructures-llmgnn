Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 9) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Possible cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (0, 1, 10, 8) 
- (0, 3, 12, 4) 
- (0, 3, 9, 7) 
- (0, 4, 12, 2) 
- (0, 4, 9, 3) 
- (1, 6, 2, 14) 
- (1, 6, 2, 12) 
- (1, 7, 8, 5) 
- (2, 5, 11, 12) 
- (2, 5, 7, 14) 
- (2, 6, 1, 10) 
- (2, 12, 11, 9) 
- (3, 4, 12, 0) 
- (3, 8, 7, 1) 
- (3, 8, 10, 14) 
- (4, 12, 0, 3) 
- (5, 7, 9, 13) 
- (7, 13, 10, 1) 
- (7, 13, 9, 5) 
- (8, 10, 14, 2) 
- (9, 11, 12, 2) 
- (9, 13, 7, 14) 
- (10, 13, 7, 1) 

Step 2:
Chorded 4-cycles:
- <0, (1, 10), 8, (0, 3)>
- <0, (3, 12), 4, (0, 4)>
- <0, (3, 9), 7, (0, 4)>
- <1, (6, 2), 14, (1, 10)>
- <1, (7, 8), 5, (1, 6)>
- <2, (5, 11), 12, (2, 6)>
- <5, (7, 9), 13, (5, 2)>
- <7, (13, 10), 1, (7, 1)>
- <7, (13, 9), 5, (7, 5)>
- <8, (10, 14), 2, (8, 3)>
- <9, (11, 12), 2, (9, 4)>
- <9, (13, 7), 14, (9, 11)>

Step 3:
Total number of chordless 4-cycles: [0]
