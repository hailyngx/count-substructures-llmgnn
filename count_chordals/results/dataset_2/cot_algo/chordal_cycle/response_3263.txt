Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 19) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 27) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 26) (27, 13) (27, 12) (27, 20) (4, 8) (4, 0) (2, 12) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 23) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 6) (26, 12) (26, 19) (26, 10) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 24) (17, 28) (17, 9) (17, 15) (9, 17) (9, 29) (9, 23) (22, 28) (22, 10) (22, 0) (22, 15) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 20) (16, 12) (16, 20) (28, 1) (28, 17) (28, 22) (28, 23) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 23) (29, 24) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 22) (10, 15) (15, 17) (15, 22) (15, 10) (0, 4) (0, 22) (0, 3) (11, 19) (11, 3) (6, 19) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 25) (24, 1) (24, 29) (24, 6) (24, 25) (14, 6) (14, 5) (23, 18) (23, 9) (23, 28) (23, 29) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 14) (20, 27) (20, 3) (20, 16) (25, 6) (25, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (7, 21, 19, 26) with edges (7, 21), (21, 19), (19, 26), (26, 12), (12, 2), (2, 18), (18, 23), (23, 9), (9, 17), (17, 28), (28, 1), (1, 5), (5, 29), (29, 23), (23, 18), (18, 2), (2, 12), (12, 26), (26, 19), (19, 21), (21, 7)
- Cycle 2: (27, 13, 8, 4) with edges (27, 13), (13, 8), (8, 4), (4, 0), (0, 22), (22, 10), (10, 15), (15, 17), (17, 28), (28, 22), (22, 0), (0, 3), (3, 8), (8, 13), (13, 27)
- Cycle 3: (9, 17, 15, 10) with edges (9, 17), (17, 15), (15, 10), (10, 26), (26, 12), (12, 27), (27, 13), (13, 8), (8, 3), (3, 11), (11, 19), (19, 21), (21, 7), (7, 10), (10, 22), (22, 28), (28, 17), (17, 9), (9, 23), (23, 18), (18, 2), (2, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has chord (12, 26)
- Cycle 2 has chord (8, 13)
- Cycle 3 has chord (10, 26)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

There are no chordless 4-cycles in this graph.
