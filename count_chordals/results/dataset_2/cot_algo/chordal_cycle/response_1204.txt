Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 7) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 13) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 2) (11, 19) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 19) (15, 8) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 12) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 6) (10, 0) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 19) (2, 14) (2, 6) (18, 12) (18, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 18) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 18) (6, 16) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 7, 16, 1, 3, 17, 5) with 2 chords: (7, 3)
- Cycle 2: (9, 7, 16, 1, 3, 17, 9) with 2 chords: (7, 3)
- Cycle 3: (9, 15, 14, 4, 0, 10, 12, 9) with no chords
- Cycle 4: (9, 15, 14, 2, 6, 16, 7, 9) with no chords
- Cycle 5: (9, 15, 19, 4, 0, 10, 13, 9) with no chords
- Cycle 6: (15, 8, 16, 7, 9, 12, 18, 15) with no chords
- Cycle 7: (8, 15, 14, 2, 6, 16, 7, 8) with no chords
- Cycle 8: (8, 19, 4, 0, 10, 16, 7, 8) with no chords
- Cycle 9: (8, 19, 4, 14, 15, 9, 12, 8) with no chords

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: (5, 7, 16, 1, 3, 17, 5) <7, 3>
- Cycle 2: (9, 7, 16, 1, 3, 17, 9) <7, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]
