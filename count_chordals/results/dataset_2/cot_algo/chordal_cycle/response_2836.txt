Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 7) (9, 10) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 11, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 4, 3, 2, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 1, 2, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 6, 10, 7, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 7, 10, 4, 0)
- Cycle 6: (2, 0, 14, 5, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 1, 6, 14, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 3, 8, 5, 2)
- Cycle 9: (4, 10, 7, 12, 4)
- Cycle 10: (7, 9, 10, 4, 7)
- Cycle 11: (9, 10, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 12: (11, 0, 6, 1, 11)
- Cycle 13: (11, 13, 1, 6, 11)
- Cycle 14: (12, 7, 10, 9, 12)
- Cycle 15: (13, 1, 6, 10, 13)

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (14, 5), 2>

Step 3:
As there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
