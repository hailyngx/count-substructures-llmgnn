Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (3, 10) (3, 19) (2, 28) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 16) (15, 20) (15, 17) (20, 15) (20, 29) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 24) (0, 23) (0, 6) (14, 23) (14, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 10) (9, 7) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 21) (16, 18) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 10) (21, 29) (21, 12) (21, 26) (21, 11) (17, 15) (17, 25) (17, 6) (25, 17) (25, 23) (25, 28) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 26) (26, 21) (26, 10) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 27) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 21) (11, 22) (12, 21) (12, 5) (12, 28) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 22) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 24) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 27) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 13) (24, 4) (24, 22) (28, 2) (28, 25) (28, 12) (23, 0) (23, 14) (23, 16) (23, 25) (27, 6) (27, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-10-8-16-18-4-13-7-19-3
- Cycle 2: 8-9-29-20-15-17-25-23-16-8
- Cycle 3: 8-10-3-19-7-13-4-18-16-8
- Cycle 4: 8-6-17-15-20-29-9-7-6
- Cycle 5: 9-8-6-0-23-25-17-15-20-29
- Cycle 6: 21-29-9-8-16-23-25-28-12-21
- Cycle 7: 10-3-19-7-6-0-23-16-10
- Cycle 8: 11-2-28-25-17-6-7-13-4-11
- Cycle 9: 27-6-0-23-25-28-12-22-24-27
- Cycle 10: 12-21-29-20-15-17-6-7-13-12
- Cycle 11: 13-4-18-16-23-25-17-6-7-13
- Cycle 12: 5-14-23-0-6-7-13-27-22-5

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (8,16)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (8,10)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (6,20)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (15,29)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (9,23)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (3,16)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (2,28)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (0,23)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (15,6)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (4,16)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph = [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (8,16)>
- <3, (8,10)>
- <4, (6,20)>
- <5, (15,29)>
- <6, (9,23)>
- <7, (3,16)>
- <8, (2,28)>
- <9, (0,23)>
- <10, (15,6)>
- <11, (4,16)>
