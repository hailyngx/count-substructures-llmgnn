- Cycle 2: (0, 10, 12, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 10, 12, 8, 11, 3, 6, 2, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 5, 1, 6, 3, 11, 13, 9, 1)
- Cycle 5: (0, 5, 1, 14, 4, 7, 2, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 5, 12, 11, 7, 2, 13, 5)
- Cycle 7: (0, 5, 14, 1, 9, 13, 11, 7, 4, 0)
- Cycle 8: (1, 6, 2, 7, 4, 5, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 6, 2, 13, 9, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 6, 3, 11, 7, 2, 13, 5, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 12, 5, 0, 10, 11, 7, 4, 14, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 12, 5, 13, 9, 1)
- Cycle 13: (1, 14, 4, 7, 2, 13, 5, 12, 1)
- Cycle 14: (4, 5, 0, 10, 12, 5, 13, 9, 1, 6, 3, 11, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 5, 0, 14, 1, 6, 3, 11, 7, 2, 13, 4)
- Cycle 16: (4, 14, 0, 5, 1, 6, 3, 11, 7, 2, 13, 4)
- Cycle 17: (5, 0, 10, 11, 7, 2, 13, 9, 1, 6, 3, 5)
- Cycle 18: (5, 0, 14, 1, 12, 10, 11, 7, 2, 13, 5)
- Cycle 19: (5, 12, 1, 6, 3, 11, 7, 2, 13, 9, 13, 5)

Step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: (0, 10, 11, 7, 4, 5, 0) with chord (10, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: (0, 5, 1, 6, 3, 11, 13, 9, 1) with chord (5, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: (1, 6, 3, 11, 7, 2, 13, 5, 1) with chord (6, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: (4, 5, 0, 10, 12, 5, 13, 9, 1, 6, 3, 11, 4) with chord (10, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 10, 11, 7> with chord (10, 4)
<0, 5, 1, 6, 3, 11, 13, 9, 1> with chord (5, 9)
<1, 6, 3, 11, 7, 2, 13, 5> with chord (6, 13)
<4, 5, 0, 10, 12, 5, 13, 9, 1, 6, 3, 11> with chord (10, 9)
