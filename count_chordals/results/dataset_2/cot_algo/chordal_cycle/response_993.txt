Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 11) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 10) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 16) (12, 5) (4, 15) (4, 18) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (17, 7) (17, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 0) (0, 19) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 0) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (9, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 4, 18, 7, 13, 2)
- Cycle 2: (10, 11, 15, 4, 18, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (11, 15, 4, 18, 14, 8, 10)
- Cycle 4: (7, 18, 4, 15, 3, 11, 10)
- Cycle 5: (16, 12, 5, 14, 18, 7, 5)
- Cycle 6: (8, 3, 11, 10, 6, 17, 7)
- Cycle 7: (8, 10, 5, 12, 16, 19, 0)
- Cycle 8: (8, 10, 6, 17, 7, 18, 14)
- Cycle 9: (2, 13, 7, 18, 4, 15, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle 1 <3, 15, 4, 18, 7, 13, 2> has exactly one chord (7, 18).
- The cycle 2 <10, 11, 15, 4, 18, 7, 5> has exactly one chord (4, 18).
- The cycle 3 <11, 15, 4, 18, 14, 8, 10> has exactly one chord (4, 18).
- The cycle 4 <7, 18, 4, 15, 3, 11, 10> has exactly one chord (4, 15).
- The cycle 5 <16, 12, 5, 14, 18, 7, 5> has exactly one chord (5, 14).
- The cycle 6 <8, 3, 11, 10, 6, 17, 7> has exactly one chord (10, 6).
- The cycle 7 <8, 10, 5, 12, 16, 19, 0> has exactly one chord (12, 16).
- The cycle 8 <8, 10, 6, 17, 7, 18, 14> has exactly one chord (6, 17).
- The cycle 9 <2, 13, 7, 18, 4, 15, 11> has exactly one chord (4, 18).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <3, 15, 4, 18, 7, 13, 2>
- <10, 11, 15, 4, 18, 7, 5>
- <11, 15, 4, 18, 14, 8, 10>
- <7, 18, 4, 15, 3, 11, 10>
- <16, 12, 5, 14, 18, 7, 5>
- <8, 3, 11, 10, 6, 17, 7>
- <8, 10, 5, 12, 16, 19, 0>
- <8, 10, 6, 17, 7, 18, 14>
- <2, 13, 7, 18, 4, 15, 11>
