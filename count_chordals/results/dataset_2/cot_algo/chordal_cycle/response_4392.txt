Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (5, 3) (5, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
Let's follow the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 6-9-4-2-6
- Cycle 2: 6-10-2-4-6
- Cycle 3: 6-14-9-4-6
- Cycle 4: 6-14-10-2-6
- Cycle 5: 9-12-0-7-9
- Cycle 6: 1-3-8-11-1
- Cycle 7: 3-5-8-14-3
- Cycle 8: 3-7-0-12-3
- Cycle 9: 10-11-8-2-10
- Cycle 10: 10-7-0-1-10
- Cycle 11: 11-14-8-5-11
- Cycle 12: 2-8-3-7-2
- Cycle 13: 8-5-3-1-8
- Cycle 14: 8-2-10-6-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <6, (9, 4), 2, 6>
- <6, (10, 2), 4, 6>
- <6, (14, 9), 4, 6>
- <6, (14, 10), 2, 6>
- <9, (12, 0), 7, 9>
- <1, (3, 8), 11, 1>
- <3, (5, 8), 14, 3>
- <3, (7, 0), 12, 3>
- <10, (11, 8), 2, 10>
- <10, (7, 0), 1, 10>
- <11, (14, 8), 5, 11>
- <2, (8, 3), 7, 2>
- <8, (5, 3), 1, 8>
- <8, (2, 10), 6, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 14

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
