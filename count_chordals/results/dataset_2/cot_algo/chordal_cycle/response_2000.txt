- Cycle <1, 5, 14, 6>
- Cycle <1, 7, 11, 3>
- Cycle <1, 10, 15, 10>
- Cycle <2, 8, 3, 11>
- Cycle <2, 8, 6, 14>
- Cycle <2, 8, 3, 13>
- Cycle <2, 8, 6, 12>
- Cycle <2, 9, 0, 16>
- Cycle <2, 9, 18, 17>
- Cycle <2, 9, 18, 17>
- Cycle <2, 9, 18, 17>
- Cycle <3, 11, 1, 5>
- Cycle <3, 11, 7, 1>

- Cycle <4, 16, 2, 9>
- Cycle <4, 16, 0, 9>
- Cycle <4, 17, 18, 9>
- Cycle <4, 17, 19, 12>
- Cycle <5, 12, 6, 14>
- Cycle <5, 14, 6, 12>
- Cycle <5, 1, 7, 11>
- Cycle <5, 1, 12, 19>
- Cycle <5, 1, 11, 3>
- Cycle <6, 12, 5, 1>
- Cycle <6, 12, 19, 17>
- Cycle <6, 8, 3, 11>
- Cycle <6, 8, 2, 9>
- Cycle <6, 14, 5, 1>
- Cycle <6, 14, 5, 2>
- Cycle <7, 1, 5, 14>
- Cycle <7, 1, 12, 6>
- Cycle <7, 11, 3, 13>
- Cycle <8, 2, 16, 4>
- Cycle <8, 3, 13, 10>
- Cycle <8, 3, 11, 1>
- Cycle <8, 3, 11, 7>
- Cycle <8, 6, 12, 19>
- Cycle <9, 2, 16, 0>
- Cycle <9, 2, 8, 3>
- Cycle <10, 15, 10, 13>
- Cycle <12, 1, 7, 11>
- Cycle <12, 1, 5, 14>
- Cycle <12, 19, 3, 11>
- Cycle <13, 10, 15, 10>
- Cycle <13, 19, 17, 4>
- Cycle <13, 19, 17, 18>
- Cycle <14, 5, 1, 12>
- Cycle <14, 5, 2, 16>
- Cycle <14, 6, 12, 19>
- Cycle <16, 0, 9, 2>
- Cycle <17, 18, 9, 0>
- Cycle <19, 12, 1, 5>

Step 2:
After checking each cycle, we find two chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 5, 12, 6> with the chord (1, 6)
- <1, 5, 14, 6> with the chord (1, 6)

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final result is [2].
