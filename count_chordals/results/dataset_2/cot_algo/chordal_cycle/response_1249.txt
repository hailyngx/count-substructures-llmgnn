Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 9) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- (1, 3, 5, 1)
- (1, 11, 5, 1)
- (1, 11, 12, 1)
- (1, 5, 3, 1)
- (3, 1, 11, 3)
- (3, 5, 1, 3)
- (3, 5, 7, 3)
- (3, 7, 13, 3)
- (3, 7, 5, 3)
- (5, 1, 11, 5)
- (5, 3, 7, 5)
- (5, 7, 3, 5)
- (5, 7, 13, 5)
- (5, 11, 1, 5)
- (7, 3, 5, 7)
- (7, 3, 13, 7)
- (7, 5, 3, 7)
- (7, 13, 6, 7)
- (7, 13, 5, 7)
- (11, 1, 5, 11)
- (11, 3, 7, 11)
- (11, 5, 1, 11)
- (11, 8, 12, 11)
- (12, 1, 11, 12)
- (12, 4, 10, 12)
- (12, 6, 13, 12)
- (12, 9, 14, 12)
- (13, 5, 7, 13)
- (13, 7, 3, 13)
- (13, 7, 6, 13)
- (13, 9, 10, 13)
- (14, 3, 5, 14)
- (14, 4, 5, 14)
- (14, 8, 11, 14)
- (14, 9, 13, 14)

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (3, 5), 1>
- <1, (11, 5), 1>
- <1, (11, 12), 1>
- <1, (3, 5), 1>
- <3, (1, 11), 3>
- <3, (5, 7), 3>
- <5, (1, 11), 5>
- <7, (3, 13), 7>
- <11, (5, 1), 11>
- <12, (1, 11), 12>
- <13, (5, 7), 13>
- <14, (3, 5), 14>

Step 3:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final answer is [12].
