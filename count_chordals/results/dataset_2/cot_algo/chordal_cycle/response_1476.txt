- Cycle 30: (5, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 31: (2, 6, 1, 8)
- Cycle 32: (6, 1, 8, 7)
- Cycle 33: (1, 8, 7, 3)
- Cycle 34: (8, 7, 3, 0)

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (5, 4), 7>
- <2, (9, 6), 4>
- <3, (7, 9), 6>
- <4, (6, 4), 9>
- <5, (4, 5), 8>
- <6, (5, 8), 2>
- <7, (8, 2), 9>
- <8, (2, 9), 6>
- <9, (9, 6), 7>
- <10, (6, 7), 4>
- <11, (7, 4), 8>
- <12, (4, 8), 5>
- <13, (8, 5), 1>
- <14, (5, 1), 7>
- <15, (1, 7), 0>
- <16, (7, 0), 3>
- <17, (0, 3), 6>
- <18, (3, 6), 9>
- <19, (6, 9), 2>
- <20, (9, 2), 8>
- <21, (2, 8), 4>
- <22, (8, 4), 7>
- <23, (4, 7), 1>
- <24, (7, 1), 0>
- <25, (1, 0), 9>
- <26, (0, 9), 4>
- <27, (9, 4), 5>
- <28, (4, 5), 2>
- <29, (5, 2), 6>
- <30, (2, 6), 1>
- <31, (6, 1), 8>
- <32, (1, 8), 7>
- <33, (8, 7), 3>
- <34, (7, 3), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 34 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Hence, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [34].
