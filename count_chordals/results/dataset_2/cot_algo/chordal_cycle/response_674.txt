Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 4) (7, 11) (7, 15) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 14) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 13) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 3) (19, 11) (19, 18) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 15) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 14) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 16, 12, 5)
- Cycle 2: (11, 19, 18, 5, 14, 12, 13, 1, 6, 4, 0, 17, 10, 11)
- Cycle 3: (17, 0, 13, 12, 16, 15, 14, 5, 18, 19, 11, 10, 17)
- Cycle 4: (8, 1, 6, 4, 0, 13, 12, 16, 15, 14, 5, 9, 8)
- Cycle 5: (3, 18, 19, 11, 10, 17, 0, 13, 12, 16, 15, 14, 5, 9, 8, 15, 7, 11, 2, 3)
  
Step 2:
- Only Cycle 1 has exactly one chord, which is (9, 12).
- Only Cycle 2 has exactly one chord, which is (18, 14).
- Only Cycle 3 has exactly one chord, which is (0, 12).
- Only Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Only Cycle 5 has exactly one chord, which is (18, 11).

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [4].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 16, 12>
- Cycle 2: <11, 19, 18, 5>
- Cycle 3: <17, 0, 13, 12>
- Cycle 5: <3, 18, 19, 11>
