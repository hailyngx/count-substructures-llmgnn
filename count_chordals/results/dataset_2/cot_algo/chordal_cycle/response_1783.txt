Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 12) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 2, 1, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 7, 3, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 0, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 10, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 14, 4, 7, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 10, 1, 12, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 0, 11, 6, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 3, 6, 14, 7)
- Cycle 9: (1, 8, 0, 11, 1)
- Cycle 10: (3, 7, 12, 1, 3)
- Cycle 11: (10, 2, 12, 8, 10)
- Cycle 12: (11, 2, 12, 13, 11)
- Cycle 13: (6, 14, 9, 10, 6)

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (2, 10), 5>
- <4, (7, 12), 10>
- <7, (4, 0), 3>
- <9, (14, 4), 7>
- <11, (2, 12), 6>

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [5].
