Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 11) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 8, 0, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 12, 4, 1, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 10, 2, 0, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 1, 4, 12, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 7, 14, 3, 9)
- Cycle 7: (1, 3, 6, 0, 1)
- Cycle 8: (3, 14, 7, 11, 3)
- Cycle 9: (6, 5, 8, 0, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 3, 14, 7, 6)
- Cycle 11: (0, 6, 13, 14, 0)
- Cycle 12: (0, 14, 7, 11, 0)
- Cycle 13: (4, 1, 9, 12, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 0, 8, 5, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 12, 9, 5, 4)
- Cycle 16: (12, 5, 8, 0, 12)
- Cycle 17: (7, 9, 12, 4, 7)
- Cycle 18: (7, 6, 3, 14, 7)
- Cycle 19: (7, 11, 1, 9, 7)
- Cycle 20: (11, 1, 9, 7, 11)
- Cycle 21: (11, 0, 6, 3, 11)
- Cycle 22: (11, 2, 10, 5, 11)
- Cycle 23: (2, 0, 14, 13, 2)
- Cycle 24: (10, 5, 8, 0, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 2 has a chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (5, 12)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (9, 1)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (6, 5)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (6, 3)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 14 has a chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 15 has a chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 17 has a chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 18 has a chord: (9, 14)
- Cycle 19 has a chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 21 has a chord: (1, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are a total of 13 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, 8, 0, (5, 6)>
<5, 12, 4, (5, 12)>
<9, 1, 4, (9, 1)>
<9, 7, 14, (9, 7)>
<1, 3, 6, (1, 3)>
<6, 5, 8, (6, 5)>
<6, 3, 14, (6, 3)>
<1, 9, 12, (1, 9)>
<1, 4, 12, (1, 4)>
<12, 5, 8, (12, 5)>
<7, 9, 12, (7, 9)>
<7, 6, 3, (7, 6)>
<11, 1, 9, (11, 1)>
