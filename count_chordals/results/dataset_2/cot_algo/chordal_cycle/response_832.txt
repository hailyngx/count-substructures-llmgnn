Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 4) (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 24) (6, 17) (6, 10) (3, 21) (3, 10) (25, 15) (25, 0) (18, 27) (18, 10) (18, 20) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 12) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 21) (29, 5) (29, 2) (29, 28) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 1) (20, 9) (20, 18) (20, 2) (28, 22) (28, 29) (28, 15) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 7) (15, 25) (15, 28) (27, 9) (27, 18) (27, 14) (1, 26) (1, 0) (1, 8) (21, 3) (21, 2) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 14) (11, 5) (11, 23) (4, 26) (4, 22) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 16) (24, 5) (24, 0) (24, 16) (24, 7) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) (12, 23) (12, 19) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 14) (7, 8) (7, 24) (7, 13) (14, 27) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 13) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <9, 26, 4, 22>: cycle of length 4
- <9, 26, 1, 0>: cycle of length 4
- <9, 26, 1, 8>: cycle of length 4
- <9, 26, 4, 22, 23>: cycle of length 5
- <9, 26, 1, 0, 25>: cycle of length 5
- <9, 26, 1, 8, 2>: cycle of length 5
- <9, 26, 4, 22, 28>: cycle of length 5
- <9, 26, 4, 22, 23, 11>: cycle of length 6
- <9, 26, 1, 0, 25, 15>: cycle of length 6
- <9, 26, 1, 8, 2, 29>: cycle of length 6
- <9, 26, 4, 22, 28, 15>: cycle of length 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <9, 26, 1, 0>: has 2 chords (5, 9) and (26, 4)
- <9, 26, 1, 8>: has 2 chords (5, 9) and (26, 4)
- <9, 26, 4, 22, 23>: has 1 chord (26, 1)
- <9, 26, 4, 22, 28>: has 1 chord (26, 1)
- <9, 26, 1, 0, 25>: has 1 chord (26, 4)
- <9, 26, 4, 22, 23, 11>: has 1 chord (26, 1)
- <9, 26, 1, 0, 25, 15>: has 1 chord (26, 4)
- <9, 26, 1, 8, 2>: has 1 chord (26, 4)
- <9, 26, 4, 22, 28, 15>: has 1 chord (26, 1)
- <9, 26, 1, 8, 2, 29>: has 1 chord (26, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are no chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
