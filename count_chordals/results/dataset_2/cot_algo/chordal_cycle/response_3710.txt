Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (13, 22, 26, 2, 13) with edges (13, 22), (22, 26), (26, 2), (2, 13), (13, 22)
- Cycle 2: (13, 22, 27, 11, 13) with edges (13, 22), (22, 27), (27, 11), (11, 13), (13, 22)
- Cycle 3: (15, 19, 28, 8, 15) with edges (15, 19), (19, 28), (28, 8), (8, 15), (15, 19)
- Cycle 4: (15, 19, 3, 23, 15) with edges (15, 19), (19, 3), (3, 23), (23, 15), (15, 19)
- Cycle 5: (2, 26, 17, 25, 2) with edges (2, 26), (26, 17), (17, 25), (25, 2), (2, 26)
- Cycle 6: (2, 0, 13, 22, 2) with edges (2, 0), (0, 13), (13, 22), (22, 2), (2, 0)
- Cycle 7: (8, 28, 19, 3, 8) with edges (8, 28), (28, 19), (19, 3), (3, 8), (8, 28)
- Cycle 8: (8, 6, 21, 2, 8) with edges (8, 6), (6, 21), (21, 2), (2, 8), (8, 6)
- Cycle 9: (21, 28, 19, 3, 21) with edges (21, 28), (28, 19), (19, 3), (3, 21), (21, 28)
- Cycle 10: (21, 6, 10, 12, 21) with edges (21, 6), (6, 10), (10, 12), (12, 21), (21, 6)
- Cycle 11: (27, 22, 13, 0, 27) with edges (27, 22), (22, 13), (13, 0), (0, 27), (27, 22)
- Cycle 12: (14, 16, 24, 12, 14) with edges (14, 16), (16, 24), (24, 12), (12, 14), (14, 16)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (26, 22)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (27, 22)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (26, 2)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (28, 19)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (21, 2)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (28, 19)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (12, 21)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (26, 22)>
<2, (27, 22)>
<5, (26, 2)>
<7, (28, 19)>
<8, (21, 2)>
<9, (28, 19)>
<10, (12, 21)>
