Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 16) (27, 5) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 24) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 22) (17, 26) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 16) (2, 18) (2, 23) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 12) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 23) (29, 7) (29, 0) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 21) (22, 17) (22, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 26) (12, 14) (12, 18) (19, 7) (19, 21) (19, 10) (10, 19) (26, 17) (26, 20) (26, 6) (11, 6) (11, 24) (24, 27) (24, 14) (24, 11) (24, 25) (0, 29) (0, 9) (0, 23) (7, 29) (7, 22) (7, 19) (7, 28) (7, 5) (21, 13) (21, 9) (21, 19) (23, 2) (23, 18) (23, 20) (23, 0) (16, 27) (16, 13) (16, 4) (28, 7) (28, 4) (28, 5) (28, 25) (25, 24) (25, 28) (4, 16) (4, 28) (5, 27) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
  <5, 14, 24, 27>
  <5, 27, 16, 13>
  <6, 1, 3, 9>
  <7, 19, 21, 13>
  <7, 19, 21, 9>
  <7, 19, 10, 21>
  <7, 22, 17, 26>
  <7, 22, 17, 20>
  <7, 22, 17, 14>
  <7, 28, 4, 16>
  <7, 28, 4, 25>
  <13, 14, 24, 27>
  <13, 21, 19, 7>
  <16, 13, 21, 19>
  <16, 27, 24, 14>
  <18, 3, 1, 6>
  <18, 3, 9, 21>
  <18, 12, 14, 24>
  <19, 7, 22, 17>
  <23, 0, 9, 21>
  <23, 18, 3, 1>
  <23, 20, 17, 22>
  <24, 14, 17, 20>
  <24, 14, 17, 22>
  <24, 11, 6, 1>
  <25, 24, 27, 5>
  <28, 7, 22, 17>

Step 2 & 3:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
  <5, 14, 24, 27> with the chord (13, 16)
  <5, 27, 16, 13> with the chord (14, 24)
  <7, 19, 10, 21> with the chord (13, 21)
  <18, 3, 9, 21> with the chord (1, 6)
  <23, 0, 9, 21> with the chord (3, 18)
  
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
