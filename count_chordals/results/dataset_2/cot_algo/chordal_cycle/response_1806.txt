Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 19) (1, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 9) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 19) (19, 1) (19, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 10) (11, 15) (11, 0) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 10) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (10, 3), (3, 10), (10, 6), (6, 2), (2, 18), (18, 9), (9, 10)
- Cycle 2: (10, 6), (6, 2), (2, 18), (18, 9), (9, 10), (10, 13), (13, 2)
- Cycle 3: (10, 13), (13, 2), (2, 18), (18, 9), (9, 10), (10, 6), (6, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 6), (6, 10), (10, 9), (9, 16), (16, 12), (12, 7), (7, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 7), (7, 12), (12, 16), (16, 9), (9, 10), (10, 6), (6, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 7), (7, 12), (12, 16), (16, 9), (9, 18), (18, 2), (2, 6)
- Cycle 7: (2, 18), (18, 9), (9, 16), (16, 12), (12, 7), (7, 2), (2, 6)
- Cycle 8: (2, 18), (18, 9), (9, 16), (16, 12), (12, 8), (8, 17), (17, 18), (18, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 18), (18, 9), (9, 16), (16, 12), (12, 8), (8, 19), (19, 1), (1, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 8, 17, 18>
- <2, 6, 9, 18>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
[2]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [2].
