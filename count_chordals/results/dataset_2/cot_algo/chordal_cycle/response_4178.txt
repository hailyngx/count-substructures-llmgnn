Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 24) (12, 29) (27, 10) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 26) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 25) (28, 16) (28, 13) (28, 10) (28, 15) (7, 9) (25, 16) (25, 22) (25, 21) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 29) (0, 23) (5, 17) (5, 3) (26, 4) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 29) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 14) (23, 0) (23, 13) (11, 24) (24, 12) (24, 4) (24, 11) (24, 13) (24, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 17) (29, 12) (29, 0) (29, 18) (29, 21) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 24) (2, 1) (2, 14) (20, 8) (20, 22) (20, 10) (21, 25) (21, 0) (21, 29) (21, 9) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 15) (9, 13) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 9) (22, 16) (22, 25) (22, 20) (14, 19) (14, 1) (14, 2) (8, 6) (8, 20) (10, 27) (10, 28) (10, 1) (10, 20) (13, 28) (13, 23) (13, 24) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the given graph, but for this problem, we are interested in cycles of length exactly 4. 
Let's find these cycles:
- Cycle 1: (12, 24, 2, 1, 12)
- Cycle 2: (12, 24, 4, 19, 12)
- Cycle 3: (12, 24, 13, 1, 12)
- Cycle 4: (12, 24, 2, 14, 12)
- Cycle 5: (27, 10, 28, 16, 27)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- The cycle <12, 24, 2, 1, 12> has a chord (24, 2).
- The cycle <12, 24, 4, 19, 12> has a chord (24, 19).
- The cycle <12, 24, 13, 1, 12> has a chord (24, 13).
- The cycle <12, 24, 2, 14, 12> has a chord (24, 14).
- The cycle <27, 10, 28, 16, 27> has a chord (10, 16).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

It appears that each cycle has exactly one chord, so there are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
