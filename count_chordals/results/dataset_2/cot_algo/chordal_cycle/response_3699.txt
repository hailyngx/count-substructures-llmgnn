Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 8) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 16) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 14) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 19) (11, 4) (11, 2) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 0) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 16) (2, 10) (2, 11) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 9) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 19) (14, 8) (18, 17) (18, 0) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 18) (0, 9) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 8, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 6, 15, 7, 5, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 13, 19, 8, 1>
- Cycle 4: <10, 17, 12, 4, 11, 2, 10>
- Cycle 5: <16, 15, 7, 19, 13, 9, 16>
- Cycle 6: <16, 15, 6, 19, 8, 3, 1, 5, 7, 15>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Out of the listed cycles, the following chordal 4-cycle is found:
- <1, (3, 8), 1> with chord (3, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
