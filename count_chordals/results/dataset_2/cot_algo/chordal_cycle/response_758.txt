Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 14) (3, 25) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 5) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 29) (25, 15) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 7) (23, 1) (23, 8) (23, 16) (23, 10) (0, 20) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 28) (28, 20) (28, 27) (28, 5) (29, 25) (29, 6) (14, 21) (14, 5) (10, 21) (10, 23) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 24) (17, 3) (17, 25) (17, 10) (17, 6) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 12) (4, 15) (4, 2) (27, 28) (27, 22) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 4) (15, 24) (18, 21) (18, 9) (18, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 26) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 23) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 6) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 29) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 22) (24, 10) (24, 15) (24, 16) (5, 3) (5, 28) (5, 14) (5, 2) (22, 27) (22, 6) (22, 11) (11, 9) (11, 22) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <1, 21, 10, 2, 1>
- <1, 21, 14, 5, 1>
- <1, 21, 18, 12, 2, 10, 23, 8, 20, 3, 17, 10, 2, 4, 15, 1>
- <3, 17, 6, 16, 24, 15, 4, 2, 5, 28, 20, 8, 23, 1, 15, 25, 3>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle <1, 21, 10, 2, 1> has one chord: (10, 2)
- Cycle <1, 21, 14, 5, 1> has one chord: (14, 5)
- Cycle <1, 21, 18, 12, 2, 10, 23, 8, 20, 3, 17, 10, 2, 4, 15, 1> has no chords
- Cycle <3, 17, 6, 16, 24, 15, 4, 2, 5, 28, 20, 8, 23, 1, 15, 25, 3> has no chords

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Since there are 2 chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 21, 10, (2), 1>
- <1, 21, 14, (5), 1>
