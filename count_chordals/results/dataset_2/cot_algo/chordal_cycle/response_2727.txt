Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (10, 7) (10, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-3-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-8-6-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-13-14-1
- Cycle 4: 2-0-7-10-12-1-2
- Cycle 5: 2-5-6-8-4-1-2
- Cycle 6: 3-1-4-8-6-13-3
- Cycle 7: 4-8-6-13-14-1-4
- Cycle 8: 6-5-2-0-7-10-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (3, 4), 1> has one chord 3-4
- <1, (4, 8), 6, 1> has one chord 4-8
- <1, (4, 13), 14, 1> has one chord 4-13
- <2, (0, 7), 10, 12, 1, 2> has one chord 0-7
- <2, (5, 6), 8, 4, 1, 2> has one chord 5-6
- <3, (1, 4), 8, 6, 13, 3> has one chord 1-4
- <4, (8, 6), 13, 14, 1, 4> has one chord 8-6
- <6, (5, 2), 0, 7, 10, 6> has one chord 5-2

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
