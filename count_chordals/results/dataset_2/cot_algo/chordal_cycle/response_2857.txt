Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 19) (26, 28) (26, 0) (15, 9) (27, 0) (27, 7) (0, 26) (0, 27) (0, 23) (4, 12) (4, 23) (18, 9) (18, 8) (3, 11) (3, 29) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 17) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 25) (21, 11) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 5) (21, 25) (28, 26) (28, 24) (28, 10) (5, 21) (5, 2) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 25) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 24) (12, 22) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 16) (1, 24) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 25) (25, 6) (25, 21) (25, 19) (25, 17) (25, 13) (14, 24) (14, 29) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (23, 0) (23, 4) (29, 3) (29, 1) (29, 14) (29, 22) (13, 21) (13, 25) (13, 16) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 20) (24, 28) (24, 12) (24, 1) (24, 14) (7, 27) (7, 19) (8, 18) (8, 11) (22, 12) (22, 29) (22, 20) (20, 16) (20, 22) (10, 28) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1:  
There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.  
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 25, 19, 17, 11)  
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 21, 11, 8, 18, 9)  
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 21, 11, 8, 18, 16)  
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 21, 11, 8, 18, 16, 20, 22, 29)  
- Cycle 5: (1, 12, 24, 28, 26, 0)  
- Cycle 6: (1, 12, 24, 28, 26, 0, 23, 4)  
- Cycle 7: (1, 12, 24, 14, 10, 28, 26, 0)  
- Cycle 8: (1, 12, 24, 14, 10, 28, 26, 0, 23, 4)  
- Cycle 9: (1, 12, 22, 29, 3, 11)  

Step 2:  
By checking each cycle in Step 1, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:  
- <1, 6, 21, 11> with chords (6, 11)  
- <1, 12, 24, 28> with chords (12, 28)  

Step 3:  
The number of chordless cycles found is [7].  
Unique chordal 4-cycles:  
- <1, 6, 21, 11>  
- <1, 12, 24, 28>
