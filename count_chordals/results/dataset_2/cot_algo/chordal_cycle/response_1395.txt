Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 12) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 18) (13, 2) (13, 7) (4, 16) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 15) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 12) (1, 10) (1, 7) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 18) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 10) (3, 17) (3, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 17) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 14) (18, 16) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 2 - 5 - 9 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 2: 2 - 15 - 11 - 17 - 2
- Cycle 3: 2 - 8 - 18 - 16 - 2
- Cycle 4: 2 - 13 - 7 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 5: 2 - 0 - 18 - 16 - 2
- Cycle 6: 2 - 15 - 10 - 18 - 2
- Cycle 7: 2 - 13 - 7 - 1 - 2
- Cycle 8: 2 - 5 - 9 - 6 - 14 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 9: 2 - 15 - 10 - 1 - 7 - 13 - 2

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
From the cycles listed above, cycles 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have exactly one chord. 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are <1, (9, 6)> and <3, (16, 18)> .

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
