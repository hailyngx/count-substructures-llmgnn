Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle <1, 3, 2, 5>
2. Cycle <1, 3, 2, 8>
3. Cycle <1, 3, 2, 4>
4. Cycle <1, 3, 5, 6>
5. Cycle <1, 6, 5, 7>
6. Cycle <1, 6, 8, 5>
7. Cycle <1, 6, 8, 2>
8. Cycle <1, 6, 4, 9>
9. Cycle <3, 2, 8, 7>
10. Cycle <3, 5, 6, 1>
11. Cycle <5, 8, 7, 0>
12. Cycle <6, 8, 7, 0>
13. Cycle <2, 8, 7, 0>
14. Cycle <8, 7, 0, 9>
15. Cycle <7, 0, 9, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle <1, 3, 2, 5> has chord (1, 2).
2. Cycle <1, 3, 2, 8> has chord (1, 2).
3. Cycle <1, 3, 2, 4> has chord (1, 2).
4. Cycle <1, 3, 5, 6> has chord (3, 5).
5. Cycle <1, 6, 5, 7> has chord (6, 5).
6. Cycle <1, 6, 8, 5> has chord (1, 5).
7. Cycle <1, 6, 8, 2> has chord (6, 2).
8. Cycle <1, 6, 4, 9> has chord (6, 4).
9. Cycle <3, 2, 8, 7> has chord (2, 8).
10. Cycle <3, 5, 6, 1> has chord (5, 6).
11. Cycle <5, 8, 7, 0> has chord (8, 7).
12. Cycle <6, 8, 7, 0> has chord (8, 7).
13. Cycle <2, 8, 7, 0> has chord (8, 7).
14. Cycle <8, 7, 0, 9> has chord (7, 0).
15. Cycle <7, 0, 9, 4> has chord (0, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
We found 0 chordless 4-cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles is [0].
