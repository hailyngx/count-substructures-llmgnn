Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 2) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 17) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 11) (9, 19) (1, 14) (1, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 14) (18, 16) (13, 15) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 7) (8, 19) (8, 7) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 8) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (12, 14) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 11-16-2-6-11
- Cycle 2: 11-15-3-6-11
- Cycle 3: 11-15-13-5-11
- Cycle 4: 11-15-19-9-11
- Cycle 5: 11-15-17-13-11
- Cycle 6: 3-15-13-17-3
- Cycle 7: 3-15-19-9-3
- Cycle 8: 3-15-11-16-3
- Cycle 9: 6-3-15-11-6
- Cycle 10: 6-3-15-13-6
- Cycle 11: 6-3-14-1-6
- Cycle 12: 6-3-15-19-6
- Cycle 13: 9-11-15-19-9
- Cycle 14: 9-11-15-3-9
- Cycle 15: 9-19-15-11-9
- Cycle 16: 9-19-15-3-9
- Cycle 17: 16-11-15-3-16
- Cycle 18: 16-11-15-13-16
- Cycle 19: 16-11-2-6-16
- Cycle 20: 5-13-15-17-5
- Cycle 21: 5-13-15-3-5
- Cycle 22: 5-13-17-7-5
- Cycle 23: 5-13-0-10-5
- Cycle 24: 4-1-14-3-4
- Cycle 25: 4-1-14-12-4
- Cycle 26: 4-1-14-3-4
- Cycle 27: 4-14-3-15-4
- Cycle 28: 4-14-3-6-4
- Cycle 29: 4-14-1-6-4
- Cycle 30: 4-14-1-3-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <19, (15, 3), 9>
- <5, (13, 15), 17>
- <5, (10, 0), 13>
- <4, (1, 14), 3>
- <4, (1, 14), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]
