Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0-6-5-10-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-8-10-11-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-7-2-11-0
- Cycle 4: 0-1-12-2-7-0
- Cycle 5: 0-1-12-4-3-0
- Cycle 6: 0-8-12-4-3-0
- Cycle 7: 0-8-12-13-7-0
- Cycle 8: 0-1-12-13-10-0
- Cycle 9: 0-1-10-11-14-0
- Cycle 10: 0-6-14-11-2-0
- Cycle 11: 0-6-14-3-4-0
- Cycle 12: 0-5-14-11-2-0
- Cycle 13: 0-5-10-13-7-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <0, (6, 10), 5>
- <0, (8, 11), 10>
- <0, (1, 7), 2>
- <0, (1, 12), 7>
- <0, (1, 12), 4>
- <0, (8, 12), 4>
- <0, (8, 13), 12>
- <0, (1, 13), 12>
- <0, (1, 11), 14>
- <0, (6, 11), 14>
- <0, (3, 14), 4>
- <0, (5, 11), 14>
- <0, (5, 13), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles = [13]
