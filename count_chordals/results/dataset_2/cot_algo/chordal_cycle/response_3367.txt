Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 12) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 8) (3, 17) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 6) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 21) (29, 7) (29, 6) (29, 18) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 11) (20, 18) (20, 5) (20, 28) (25, 26) (25, 22) (5, 20) (5, 12) (5, 1) (8, 26) (8, 0) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 24) (13, 22) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 25) (22, 13) (22, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 18) (7, 15) (7, 29) (7, 22) (7, 0) (7, 11) (6, 15) (6, 29) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 12) (21, 2) (21, 6) (21, 24) (4, 12) (27, 10) (27, 1) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 4) (11, 17) (11, 7) (16, 9) (16, 18) (1, 5) (1, 23) (1, 27) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 24) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 28) (28, 2) (28, 20) (28, 19) (18, 29) (18, 20) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 16) (24, 23) (24, 21) (24, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- <2, 23, 1, 5, 12, 6>
- <7, 15, 6, 13, 22, 25, 26, 8, 0, 14, 17, 3>
- <7, 15, 6, 21, 24, 10, 27, 1, 5, 12, 6>
- <7, 15, 6, 29, 18, 20, 28, 19, 13, 6>
- <7, 15, 6, 29, 18, 0, 14, 17, 11, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <2, 23, 1, 5, 12, 6> has chord (5, 1)
- <7, 15, 6, 13, 22, 25, 26, 8, 0, 14, 17, 3> has chord (26, 17)
- <7, 15, 6, 21, 24, 10, 27, 1, 5, 12, 6> has chord (21, 10)
- <7, 15, 6, 29, 18, 20, 28, 19, 13, 6> has chord (29, 19)
- <7, 15, 6, 29, 18, 0, 14, 17, 11, 7> has chord (29, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are [0] chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
