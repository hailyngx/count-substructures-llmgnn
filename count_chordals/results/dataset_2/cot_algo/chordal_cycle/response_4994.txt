Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

1. Cycle 1 <5, 7, 9, 0> has a chord (0, 9)
2. Cycle 2 <5, 9, 13, 12> has a chord (5, 13)
3. Cycle 3 <5, 9, 13, 3> has a chord (5, 13)
4. Cycle 4 <5, 9, 4, 10> has a chord (9, 5)
5. Cycle 5 <2, 5, 8, 14> has a chord (2, 8)
6. Cycle 6 <3, 5, 8, 13> has a chord (8, 5)
7. Cycle 7 <3, 5, 12, 13> has a chord (5, 13)
8. Cycle 8 <1, 4, 5, 10> has a chord (4, 5)
9. Cycle 9 <8, 9, 12, 13> has a chord (9, 12)
10. Cycle 10 <3, 5, 9, 13> has a chord (5, 13)
11. Cycle 11 <0, 4, 9, 11> has a chord (9, 0)
12. Cycle 14 <0, 2, 4, 8> has a chord (0, 4)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [8]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, 7, 9, 0>, <5, 9, 13, 12>, <5, 9, 13, 3>, <9, 5, 4, 10>, <2, 5, 8, 14>, <3, 5, 8, 13>, <3, 5, 12, 13>, <1, 4, 5, 10>
