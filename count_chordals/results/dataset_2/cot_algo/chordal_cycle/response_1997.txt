Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 5) (9, 13) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. 

Here is the list of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, (1, 6), 13, 5)>
<0, (13, 3), 2, 8)>
<0, (13, 5), 11, 2)>
<1, (0, 13), 5, 11)>
<2, (8, 14), 4, 12)>
<3, (9, 13), 5, 10)>
<4, (6, 12), 14, 8)>
<5, (11, 13), 3, 10)>
<6, (1, 14), 12, 4)>
<8, (2, 10), 13, 5)>

Therefore, the final count of the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
