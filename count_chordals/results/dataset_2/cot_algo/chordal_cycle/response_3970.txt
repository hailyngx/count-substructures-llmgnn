Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (1, 5, 3, 9, 1)
2. (1, 9, 8, 6, 4, 1)
3. (0, 9, 5, 2, 0)
4. (0, 9, 8, 6, 4, 0)
5. (4, 6, 8, 9, 4)
6. (6, 4, 0, 7, 6)

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. (1, 5, 3, 9, 1) - <1, (5, 9), 3>
2. (1, 9, 8, 6, 4, 1) - <2, (9, 6), 8>
3. (0, 9, 5, 2, 0) - <3, (9, 2), 5>
4. (0, 9, 8, 6, 4, 0) - <4, (9, 6), 8>
5. (4, 6, 8, 9, 4) - <5, (6, 9), 8>
6. (6, 4, 0, 7, 6) - <6, (4, 7), 0>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
