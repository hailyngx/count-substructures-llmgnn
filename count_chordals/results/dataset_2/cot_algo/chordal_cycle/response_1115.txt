    Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (28, 26), 25)>

        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6, (24, 16), 3)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <15, (18, 27), 4)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <16, (24, 16), 3)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <17, (18, 27), 4)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <18, (26, 28), 1)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <19, (26, 28), 16)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <20, (19, 0), 22)>
