Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 17) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 20) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 25) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 23) (1, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 17) (8, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 20) (7, 22) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 19) (6, 26) (6, 28) (6, 25) (28, 6) (28, 23) (19, 26) (19, 12) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 27) (2, 4) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 0) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 20) (20, 5) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 17) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 29) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 27) (25, 15) (25, 6) (27, 19) (27, 10) (11, 4) (23, 1) (23, 28) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 22) (29, 24) (14, 12) (14, 13) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 18) (24, 12) (24, 19) (24, 29) (22, 7) (22, 29) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- <0, 5, 7, 12>
- <1, 3, 15, 25>
- <1, 3, 13, 14>
- <1, 13, 14, 12>
- <4, 10, 18, 2>
- <6, 25, 15, 3>
- <7, 5, 20, 17>
- <7, 20, 17, 8>
- <10, 4, 11, 27>
- <12, 7, 5, 0>
- <12, 7, 29, 24>
- <12, 14, 13, 1>
- <12, 19, 17, 8>
- <19, 12, 7, 5>
- <19, 26, 9, 17>
- <20, 7, 5, 0>
- <20, 17, 19, 26>
- <26, 19, 12, 7>
- <29, 7, 5, 0>

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are:
- <1, 13, 14, 12, (1, 14)>
- <4, 10, 18, 2, (4, 18)>
- <12, 7, 29, 24, (12, 29)>
- <19, 12, 7, 5, (12, 5)>
- <29, 7, 5, 0, (7, 0)>

Step 3: 
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
