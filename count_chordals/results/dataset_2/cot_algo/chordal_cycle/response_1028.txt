Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, such as:
1. Cycle {4, 0, 9, 1, 4}
2. Cycle {4, 6, 9, 7, 4}
3. Cycle {4, 6, 1, 8, 4}
4. Cycle {7, 4, 0, 9, 7}
5. Cycle {7, 9, 6, 1, 7}
6. Cycle {6, 4, 3, 8, 6}
7. Cycle {9, 7, 4, 1, 9}
... and more.

Step 2: 
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle {4, 0, 9, 1, 4} has a chord (0, 1).
- Cycle {4, 6, 9, 7, 4} has a chord (6, 7).
- Cycle {4, 6, 1, 8, 4} has a chord (6, 8).
... and more.

Step 3: 
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are [3] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<4, 0, 9, 1> with a chord (0, 1)
<4, 6, 9, 7> with a chord (6, 7)
<4, 6, 1, 8> with a chord (6, 8)
