Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 12) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (1, 4, 13, 5)
2. (1, 4, 13, 12)
3. (1, 4, 10, 6)
4. (1, 4, 10, 14)
5. (1, 3, 9, 8)
6. (3, 9, 14, 6)
7. (3, 9, 14, 10)
8. (3, 9, 0, 12)
9. (3, 1, 12, 13)
10. (3, 1, 12, 0)
11. (3, 1, 14, 6)
12. (3, 1, 14, 10)
13. (1, 12, 0, 9)
14. (1, 14, 6, 10)
15. (4, 13, 12, 0)
16. (4, 13, 12, 1)
17. (4, 10, 6, 14)
18. (14, 6, 10, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
1. <1, 4, 13, 5> (Chord: (1, 13))
2. <1, 4, 13, 12> (Chord: (4, 13))
3. <1, 4, 10, 6> (Chord: (4, 6))
4. <1, 4, 10, 14> (Chord: (4, 10))
5. <1, 3, 9, 8> (Chord: (3, 9))
6. <3, 9, 14, 6> (Chord: (9, 14))
7. <3, 9, 14, 10> (Chord: (9, 10))
8. <3, 9, 0, 12> (Chord: (9, 0))
9. <3, 1, 12, 13> (Chord: (1, 12))
10. <3, 1, 12, 0> (Chord: (1, 12))
11. <3, 1, 14, 6> (Chord: (1, 14))
12. <3, 1, 14, 10> (Chord: (1, 14))
13. <1, 12, 0, 9> (Chord: (12, 0))
14. <1, 14, 6, 10> (Chord: (6, 14))
15. <4, 13, 12, 0> (Chord: (13, 12))
16. <4, 13, 12, 1> (Chord: (13, 12))
17. <4, 10, 6, 14> (Chord: (10, 6))
18. <14, 6, 10, 4> (Chord: (6, 10))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 18 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [18].
