Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 6) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 8 - 10 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 1 - 13 - 6 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 3: 3 - 1 - 8 - 10 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 4: 4 - 0 - 11 - 6 - 13 - 4
- Cycle 5: 7 - 6 - 13 - 10 - 7
- Cycle 6: 8 - 1 - 9 - 7 - 3 - 8
- Cycle 7: 11 - 0 - 5 - 6 - 11
- Cycle 8: 12 - 9 - 8 - 10 - 7 - 12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 8 - 10 - 4 - 0 has one chord: (1, 10)
- Cycle 2: 0 - 1 - 13 - 6 - 5 - 0 has one chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 3: 3 - 1 - 8 - 10 - 7 - 3 has one chord: (1, 10)
- Cycle 4: 4 - 0 - 11 - 6 - 13 - 4 has one chord: (0, 6)
- Cycle 6: 8 - 1 - 9 - 7 - 3 - 8 has one chord: (1, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [3]

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 1, 8, (10, 4)>
<0, 1, 13, (6, 5)>
<8, 1, 9, (7, 3)>
