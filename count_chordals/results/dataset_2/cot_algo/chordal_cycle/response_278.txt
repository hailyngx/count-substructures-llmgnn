Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 19) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 0) (18, 13) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (15, 17) (15, 7) (13, 17) (13, 18) (13, 19) (16, 7) (16, 3) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 9) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (6, 17) (6, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 9) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 3) (8, 7) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 3) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 9) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 2, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (9, 11, 14, 12, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 11, 14, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 11, 19, 13, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 11, 19, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 14, 12, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 14, 11, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 14, 11, 19, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 14, 11, 19, 13, 9)
- Cycle 10: (3, 4, 5, 2, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 4, 5, 0, 3)
- Cycle 12: (3, 4, 17, 13, 3)
- Cycle 13: (3, 4, 17, 6, 3)
- Cycle 14: (3, 4, 19, 11, 3)
- Cycle 15: (3, 9, 11, 14, 3)
- Cycle 16: (3, 9, 11, 19, 3)
- Cycle 17: (3, 9, 14, 12, 3)
- Cycle 18: (3, 9, 14, 11, 3)
- Cycle 19: (3, 9, 19, 11, 3)
- Cycle 20: (3, 16, 7, 15, 3)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (2, 4), 5>
- <9, (11, 14), 12>
- <9, (11, 19), 13>
- <3, (4, 5), 2>
- <3, (4, 19), 11>

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles = [5]
