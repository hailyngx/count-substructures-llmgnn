Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 13) (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (10, 18) (10, 1) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 17) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 18) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 18) (17, 2) (17, 1) (17, 3) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 17) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 13) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 14) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing:
- Cycle with nodes: 1-6-9-13-15-1
- Cycle with nodes: 1-6-7-15-13-1
- Cycle with nodes: 1-6-9-13-4-19-0-15-1
- Cycle with nodes: 1-6-7-15-0-19-4-13-1
- Cycle with nodes: 1-6-7-15-13-9-12-2-1
- Cycle with nodes: 1-6-9-13-15-7-16-13-1
- Cycle with nodes: 1-6-9-12-2-14-18-10-1

Step 2:
Checking for chords:
- <1, 6, 9, 13, (15, 1)> - Chord: (15, 1)
- <1, 6, 7, 15, (13, 1)> - Chord: (13, 1)
- <1, 6, 7, 15, (0, 19)> - Chord: (0, 19)
- <1, 6, 7, 15, (13, 9)> - Chord: (13, 9)
- <1, 6, 9, 13, (15, 1)> - Chord: (15, 1)
- <1, 6, 9, 13, (7, 16)> - Chord: (7, 16)
- <1, 6, 9, 12, (2, 14)> - Chord: (2, 14)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
