Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 7, 0, 3> (Chord: 0, 3)
- <1, 14, 13, 12> (Chord: 13, 12)
- <1, 2, 6, 13> (Chord: 6, 13)
- <1, 2, 10, 4> (Chord: 10, 4)
- <1, 2, 5, 12> (Chord: 5, 12)
- <3, 12, 5, 2> (Chord: 5, 2)
- <7, 1, 6, 13> (Chord: 6, 13)
- <2, 1, 7, 0> (Chord: 7, 0)
- <13, 14, 9, 7> (Chord: 9, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
- There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
