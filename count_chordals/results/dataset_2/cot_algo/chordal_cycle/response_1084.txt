Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 5) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 18) (2, 11) (2, 7) (18, 10) (18, 12) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 7) (5, 16) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 15) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 19) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 13) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 13) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (6, 11), 13>
2. <2, (7, 12), 10>
3. <5, (14, 19), 7>
4. <10, (17, 18), 12>
5. <11, (16, 5), 2>
6. <12, (18, 10), 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As all cycles have at least one chord, there are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
