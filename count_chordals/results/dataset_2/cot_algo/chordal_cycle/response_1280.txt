Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 15) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 1) (17, 10) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 18) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 6) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (4, 19) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 0) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 18) (0, 6) (0, 18) (0, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (1, 5, 9, 2, 1)
2. (1, 14, 8, 13, 7, 3, 6, 1)
3. (1, 14, 8, 7, 3, 6, 1)
4. (1, 14, 8, 7, 13, 6, 1)
5. (1, 14, 8, 12, 13, 7, 3, 6, 1)
6. (1, 14, 8, 12, 13, 6, 1)
7. (1, 6, 3, 7, 8, 14, 1)
8. (1, 6, 3, 7, 13, 8, 14, 1)
9. (1, 6, 13, 8, 7, 3, 6, 1)
10. (1, 6, 13, 8, 14, 1)
11. (2, 16, 7, 3, 6, 1, 5, 9, 2)
12. (4, 2, 9, 15, 10, 18, 7, 8, 14, 1, 6, 3, 7, 16, 2)
13. (7, 3, 6, 1, 5, 9, 2, 16, 11, 14, 8, 13, 7)
14. (18, 5, 1, 14, 8, 7, 3, 6, 1, 5, 9, 15, 10, 17, 10, 18)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
1. <1, (2, 16), 9>
2. <2, (4, 9), 15>
3. <1, (6, 14), 8>
4. <1, (6, 14), 8>
5. <1, (6, 14), 8>

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
