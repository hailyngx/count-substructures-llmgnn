Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 15) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (1, 2) (1, 11) (6, 8) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 16) (19, 10) (19, 15) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 13) (5, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 15) (16, 9) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- <0, 7, 11, 4, 8>
- <0, 7, 11, 1, 2>
- <0, 7, 2, 1, 11>
- <0, 15, 4, 8, 14>
- <0, 15, 2, 1, 11>
- <0, 15, 19, 10, 17>
- <0, 15, 19, 10, 9>
- <0, 12, 18, 13, 10>
- <0, 12, 18, 13, 3>
- <0, 12, 14, 8, 4>
- <1, 11, 7, 0, 15>
- <1, 11, 4, 8, 14>
- <2, 1, 11, 7, 0>
- <2, 1, 11, 4, 8>
- <3, 13, 18, 12, 0>
- <4, 11, 7, 0, 15>
- <4, 11, 1, 2, 7>
- <4, 8, 14, 12, 18>
- <4, 8, 14, 12, 0>
- <4, 15, 0, 12, 18>
- <4, 15, 0, 7, 2>
- <5, 12, 18, 13, 10>
- <8, 14, 12, 18, 0>
- <8, 14, 12, 0, 15>
- <10, 17, 3, 13, 18>
- <10, 17, 3, 13, 18>
- <10, 17, 3, 13, 18>
- <11, 7, 0, 15, 19>
- <11, 9, 16, 15, 0>
- <12, 0, 15, 19, 10>
- <14, 8, 4, 11, 1>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 7, 11, 4, 8> [Chord: (0, 4)]
- <0, 15, 19, 10, 17> [Chord: (15, 17)]
- <0, 12, 18, 13, 10> [Chord: (12, 13)]

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles found: [0]
