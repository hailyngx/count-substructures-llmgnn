2. (6, 11, 19, 12)
3. (6, 9, 12, 14)
4. (6, 9, 12, 19)
5. (6, 9, 0, 10)
6. (6, 9, 0, 10, 5)
7. (6, 8, 12, 14)
8. (6, 8, 12, 19)
9. (6, 8, 3, 17)
10. (11, 19, 12, 14)
11. (11, 19, 12, 8)
12. (16, 14, 18, 8)
13. (16, 14, 12, 8)
14. (16, 15, 2, 18)
15. (16, 15, 2, 14)

18. (9, 6, 11, 19)
19. (9, 6, 7, 17)
20. (9, 6, 8, 12)
21. (9, 0, 10, 18)
22. (9, 0, 10, 5)
23. (9, 12, 14, 18)
24. (9, 12, 14, 16)
25. (9, 12, 19, 11)
26. (9, 12, 8, 6)
27. (2, 15, 16, 14)
28. (2, 15, 16, 18)
29. (18, 14, 16, 2)
30. (18, 14, 16, 15)
31. (3, 11, 19, 12)
32. (3, 11, 6, 7)
33. (3, 11, 6, 9)
34. (3, 17, 7, 5)
35. (3, 17, 7, 6)
36. (3, 17, 7, 17)
37. (3, 17, 7, 6)
38. (3, 8, 12, 19)
39. (3, 8, 12, 14)
40. (3, 8, 12, 9)
41. (1, 10, 0, 9)
42. (1, 10, 0, 10)
43. (1, 10, 0, 5)
44. (5, 10, 1, 13)
45. (5, 10, 1, 10)
46. (5, 10, 0, 9)
47. (17, 7, 6, 9)
48. (17, 7, 6, 8)
49. (17, 3, 11, 19)
50. (17, 3, 11, 6)
51. (11, 19, 13, 3)
52. (11, 19, 13, 1)

Step 2:
By checking each cycle, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<6, 11, 19, 12> with the chord (6, 12)

So, the number of chordless cycles found is [1].
