Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 4, 9)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 3, 7)
- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 9, 6)
- Cycle 4: (1, 4, 7, 0)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 6, 2)
- Cycle 6: (1, 0, 7, 3)
- Cycle 7: (5, 3, 7, 0)
- Cycle 8: (5, 3, 8, 9)
- Cycle 9: (5, 4, 9, 8)
- Cycle 10: (5, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 11: (9, 4, 7, 3)
- Cycle 12: (9, 4, 1, 0)
- Cycle 13: (9, 4, 2, 6)
- Cycle 14: (9, 8, 3, 7)
- Cycle 15: (4, 7, 3, 5)
- Cycle 16: (4, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 17: (4, 6, 2, 1)
- Cycle 18: (7, 0, 1, 5)
- Cycle 19: (7, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 20: (7, 3, 8, 9)
- Cycle 21: (7, 4, 2, 1)
- Cycle 22: (6, 9, 8, 3)
- Cycle 23: (6, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 24: (2, 4, 9, 8)

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, the cycles with exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes) are: 
- <1, (4, 9), 6>
- <1, (4, 7), 0>
- <1, (4, 6), 2>
- <5, (3, 8), 9>
- <5, (4, 9), 8>
- <7, (0, 1), 5>
- <7, (3, 8), 9>
- <9, (4, 2), 6>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 16, so the final count is [16]. 

I have listed each of the unique chordal 4-cycles inside <> above. Let me know if you need clarification!
