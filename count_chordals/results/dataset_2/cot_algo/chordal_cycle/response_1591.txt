Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles of length 4 in this graph:
1. Cycle: 5-2-4-7-5
2. Cycle: 5-1-7-4-5
3. Cycle: 5-7-3-1-5
4. Cycle: 5-7-2-4-5
5. Cycle: 9-6-4-7-9
6. Cycle: 9-8-3-7-9
7. Cycle: 9-0-6-4-9
8. Cycle: 4-7-3-6-4
9. Cycle: 4-0-6-9-4
10. Cycle: 7-5-2-4-7
11. Cycle: 7-4-6-3-7
12. Cycle: 7-3-8-1-7
13. Cycle: 7-1-5-2-7
14. Cycle: 1-5-2-7-1
15. Cycle: 1-7-3-8-1
16. Cycle: 1-3-6-9-1
17. Cycle: 3-7-1-5-3
18. Cycle: 3-1-2-7-3
19. Cycle: 3-6-0-9-3
20. Cycle: 3-2-8-1-3
21. Cycle: 6-9-0-4-6
22. Cycle: 6-4-7-3-6
23. Cycle: 6-3-8-9-6
24. Cycle: 6-0-4-7-6
25. Cycle: 8-9-0-6-8
26. Cycle: 8-3-7-4-8
27. Cycle: 8-2-7-1-8
28. Cycle: 2-5-1-7-2
29. Cycle: 2-4-7-3-2
30. Cycle: 2-7-3-1-2
31. Cycle: 2-1-5-7-2
32. Cycle: 2-3-6-9-2
33. Cycle: 2-8-3-7-2
34. Cycle: 0-9-8-3-0
35. Cycle: 0-4-6-3-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

There are two chordal 4-cycles in this graph:
1. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (1, 7), 4>
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (6, 4), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 33 chordless cycles out of the 35 cycles mentioned above.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [2].
