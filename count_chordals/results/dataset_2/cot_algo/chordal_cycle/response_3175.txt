Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 12) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 8) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 6) (1, 8) (1, 19) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 1) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 12) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (8,17,14,10)
- (12,16,11,13)
- (3,15,14,17)
- (0,2,8,17)
- (6,4,12,16)
- (7,3,15,14)
- (10,14,17,5)
- (2,8,1,9)
- (1,8,17,14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <2, (9, 16), 10>
- <7, (13, 4), 6>
- <0, (15, 17), 5>
- <3, (14, 7), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [4].
