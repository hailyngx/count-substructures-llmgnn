Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (18, 10) (18, 15) (19, 13) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 18) (3, 0) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 16) (8, 5) (8, 11) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 6) (2, 17) (2, 13) (9, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 6) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 15) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 12 - 1 - 4
        - Cycle 2: 4 - 10 - 18 - 15 - 14 - 4
        - Cycle 3: 4 - 14 - 15 - 13 - 19 - 13 - 2 - 17 - 4
        - Cycle 4: 4 - 17 - 16 - 5 - 1 - 12 - 7 - 4
        - Cycle 5: 4 - 1 - 5 - 16 - 17 - 12 - 6 - 11 - 0 - 4
        - Cycle 6: 7 - 12 - 6 - 16 - 17 - 2 - 13 - 14 - 15 - 18 - 10 - 0 - 11 - 8 - 5 - 7
        - Cycle 7: 10 - 0 - 3 - 11 - 8 - 5 - 16 - 6 - 12 - 7 - 4
        ... and several more cycles
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 is chordless
        - Cycle 2 contains one chord: (15, 18)
        - Cycle 3 contains one chord: (15, 18)
        - Cycle 4 contains one chord: (16, 5)
        - Cycle 5 is chordless
        - Cycle 6 contains one chord: (7, 12)
        - Cycle 7 is chordless
        ... and more cycles

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are several chordless cycles found, the number of chordless cycles is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <4, 7, 12, 1>
        <4, 1, 5, 16>
        <7, 12, 6, 16>
        <10, 0, 3, 11>
        <12, 7, 4, 17>
