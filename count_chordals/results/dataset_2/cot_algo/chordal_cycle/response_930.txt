Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 1) (8, 6) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 6) (2, 17) (2, 11) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (0, 13) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 16) (1, 9) (1, 12) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 5) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 3) (4, 3) (12, 10) (12, 1) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 4) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 5) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 11) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  

Cycles of length 4:  
- Cycle 1: (6, 14, 7, 10)  
- Cycle 2: (6, 14, 16, 5)  
- Cycle 3: (6, 2, 17, 19)  
- Cycle 4: (6, 2, 11, 13)  
- Cycle 5: (6, 2, 11, 18)  
- Cycle 6: (6, 11, 18, 19)  
- Cycle 7: (6, 11, 18, 15)  
- Cycle 8: (6, 11, 5, 16)  
- Cycle 9: (6, 8, 13, 11)  
- Cycle 10: (6, 8, 13, 0)  
- Cycle 11: (6, 8, 13, 11)  
- Cycle 12: (6, 8, 13, 0)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  

Chordal Cycles:  
<1, (6, 2), 13, 11>  
<2, (6, 11), 18, 13>  
<3, (6, 18), 19, 11>  
<4, (6, 8), 13, 11>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.  
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.  

Final answer: [4]
