Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (6, 10) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (13, 7) (13, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 1-7-10-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-7-10-12-1
- Cycle 3: 1-11-10-6-1
- Cycle 4: 1-11-10-12-1
- Cycle 5: 1-11-9-6-1
- Cycle 6: 1-11-9-12-1
- Cycle 7: 4-2-3-5-4
- Cycle 8: 4-2-5-14-4
- Cycle 9: 4-12-10-6-4
- Cycle 10: 4-12-10-11-4
- Cycle 11: 4-12-0-6-4
- Cycle 12: 4-12-0-11-4
- Cycle 13: 7-10-11-14-7
- Cycle 14: 7-10-11-1-7
- Cycle 15: 7-10-12-0-7
- Cycle 16: 7-10-12-4-7
- Cycle 17: 7-10-6-9-7
- Cycle 18: 7-10-6-1-7
- Cycle 19: 7-13-1-11-7
- Cycle 20: 7-13-1-3-7
- Cycle 21: 7-13-1-2-7
- Cycle 22: 10-12-0-6-10
- Cycle 23: 10-12-0-11-10
- Cycle 24: 10-12-4-7-10
- Cycle 25: 10-12-4-2-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 11, 10, 6> (chord: 11-6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 11, 10, 12> (chord: 11-12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, 2, 3, 5> (chord: 2-5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 2, 5, 14> (chord: 2-14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, 12, 0, 6> (chord: 12-0)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <7, 10, 11, 1> (chord: 10-1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, 10, 12, 0> (chord: 10-0)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <7, 13, 1, 11> (chord: 13-11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <10, 12, 4, 7> (chord: 12-4)
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles is [9].
