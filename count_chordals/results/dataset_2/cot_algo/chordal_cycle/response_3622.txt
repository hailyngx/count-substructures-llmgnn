Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- (1, 7, 9, 0, 1)
- (2, 8, 6, 4, 2)
- (3, 5, 2, 8, 3)
- (4, 8, 6, 3, 4)
- (6, 4, 2, 8, 6)
- (9, 7, 1, 5, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (7, 9), 0, 1>
- <2, (8, 6), 4, 2>
- <3, (5, 2), 8, 3>
- <4, (8, 6), 3, 4>
- <6, (4, 2), 8, 6>
- <9, (7, 1), 5, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final answer is [6].
