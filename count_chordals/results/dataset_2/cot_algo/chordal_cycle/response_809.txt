Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:  
- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 8, 5, 0)  
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 8, 1, 0)  
- Cycle 3: (0, 7, 1, 5, 0)  
- Cycle 4: (0, 2, 6, 3, 0)  

Step 2: Check for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:  
- Cycle 1: (0, 4), (8, 5) -> Chord (4, 5)  
- Cycle 2: (5, 8), (1, 0) -> Chord (5, 1)  
- Cycle 3: (1, 5), (7, 0) -> Chord (1, 7)  
- Cycle 4: (0, 2), (6, 3) -> Chord (0, 6)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:  
Number of chordless cycles = 0  

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles is [0].  
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, (4, 5)>.
