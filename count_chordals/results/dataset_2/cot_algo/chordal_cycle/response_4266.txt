Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 2) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 7) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (2, 8, 11, 6, 2)
- Cycle 2: (2, 4, 3, 7, 2)
- Cycle 3: (2, 3, 11, 8, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 7, 6, 11, 2)
- Cycle 5: (8, 9, 13, 12, 8)
- Cycle 6: (8, 11, 3, 4, 2)
- Cycle 7: (8, 0, 12, 1, 8)
- Cycle 8: (8, 7, 6, 11, 8)
- Cycle 9: (3, 11, 8, 0, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 7, 6, 11, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 4, 2, 8, 3)
- Cycle 12: (11, 8, 0, 12, 11)
- Cycle 13: (11, 3, 4, 2, 11)
- Cycle 14: (11, 6, 7, 8, 11)
- Cycle 15: (9, 8, 11, 6, 9)
- Cycle 16: (9, 13, 1, 12, 9)
- Cycles 17 to 48: More cycles can be found but they are not 4-cycles and will not form chordal 4-cycles.

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Only Cycle 8: (8, 7, 6, 11, 8) has a chord (6, 8).

Step 3:
Count of chordless 4-cycles: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <8, (6, 8), 7>
