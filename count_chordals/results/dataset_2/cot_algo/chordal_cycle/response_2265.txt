Step 2 and Step 3:

The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are as follows: 
<5, (14, 0), 27>
<9, (7, 11), 18>
<14, (16, 28), 22>
<0, (27, 11), 6>
<13, (17, 4), 0>
<13, (17, 4), 14>
<13, (17, 4), 7>
<13, (17, 4), 15>
<13, (15, 2), 19>
<13, (15, 2), 18>
<13, (15, 2), 4>
<22, (19, 1), 26>
<22, (19, 1), 2>
<22, (28, 14), 0>
<19, (1, 26), 10>
<19, (1, 26), 20>
<19, (2, 15), 13>
<19, (2, 15), 18>
<19, (2, 15), 4>

<26, (21, 28), 22>
<26, (10, 24), 25>
<26, (10, 24), 11> 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [24].
