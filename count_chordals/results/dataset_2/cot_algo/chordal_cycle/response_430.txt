Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: {0, 3, 5, 14}
- Cycle 2: {1, 2, 13, 14}
- Cycle 3: {1, 2, 9, 6}
- Cycle 4: {1, 4, 0, 13}
- Cycle 5: {1, 10, 7, 0}
- Cycle 6: {3, 5, 14, 11}
- Cycle 7: {6, 9, 7, 0}
- Cycle 8: {6, 8, 14, 5}
- Cycle 9: {6, 8, 1, 4}
- Cycle 10: {6, 8, 12, 3}
- Cycle 11: {6, 11, 3, 0}
- Cycle 12: {6, 12, 13, 2}
- Cycle 13: {7, 9, 2, 13}
- Cycle 14: {8, 11, 3, 0}
- Cycle 15: {8, 11, 14, 5}
- Cycle 16: {8, 12, 13, 2}
- Cycle 17: {9, 2, 13, 1}
- Cycle 18: {10, 1, 4, 0}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-Cycle 1: <0, 5, 14, 3, (0, 14)>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 2: <2, 9, 6, 1, (2, 6)>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 3: <4, 1, 13, 0, (1, 13)>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 4: <7, 9, 2, 13, (9, 2)>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 5: <8, 12, 13, 2, (8, 13)>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 6: <8, 11, 3, 0, (8, 3)>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 7: <11, 14, 5, 3, (11, 5)>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 8: <6, 8, 1, 4, (8, 1)>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 9: <6, 12, 13, 2, (12, 13)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
- Therefore, the final count is [9].
