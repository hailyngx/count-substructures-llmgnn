Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 15) (15, 16) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 13) (20, 25) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 5) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 2) (22, 11) (22, 23) (23, 22) (23, 13) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 14) (29, 11) (29, 24) (19, 15) (19, 25) (19, 26) (19, 4) (19, 13) (26, 28) (26, 19) (1, 10) (17, 11) (17, 9) (3, 2) (21, 9) (21, 24) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 0) (9, 17) (9, 21) (18, 24) (18, 0) (7, 28) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 15) (14, 28) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 5) (5, 20) (5, 25) (5, 12) (5, 4) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 8) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 3) (13, 27) (13, 23) (13, 19) (13, 14) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 21) (24, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle: 11 - 16 - 15 - 27 - 11 (Chordless)
2. Cycle: 11 - 16 - 2 - 25 - 11 (Chordless)
3. Cycle: 11 - 16 - 15 - 19 - 11 (Chordless)
4. Cycle: 11 - 16 - 15 - 14 - 11 (Chordless)
5. Cycle: 11 - 16 - 2 - 20 - 11 (Chordless)
6. Cycle: 11 - 16 - 2 - 3 - 11 (Chordless)
7. Cycle: 11 - 15 - 27 - 13 - 11 (Chordless)
8. Cycle: 11 - 15 - 19 - 26 - 11 (Chordless)
9. Cycle: 11 - 2 - 20 - 24 - 11 (Chordless)
10. Cycle: 11 - 2 - 25 - 19 - 11 (Chordless)
11. Cycle: 11 - 2 - 25 - 5 - 11 (Chordless)
12. Cycle: 11 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 11 (Chordless)
13. Cycle: 11 - 16 - 15 - 14 - 4 - 19 - 25 - 2 - 11 (Chordless)
14. Cycle: 11 - 16 - 2 - 25 - 19 - 15 - 14 - 28 - 26 - 11 (Chordless)
15. Cycle: 11 - 16 - 15 - 27 - 13 - 23 - 22 - 11 (Chordless)
16. Cycle: 11 - 2 - 20 - 24 - 29 - 24 - 21 - 9 - 17 - 11 (Chordless)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- None of the cycles listed above have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 16 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Putting the final number inside brackets, the count is [16].
