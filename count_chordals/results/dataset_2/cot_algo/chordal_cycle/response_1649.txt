Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (5, 0) (5, 3) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 15) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 15) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 7) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (9, 3) (9, 10) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 12) (1, 19) (1, 4) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 12) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 17-14-13-19-17
- Cycle 2: 2-8-16-7-6-13-14-17-11-2
- Cycle 3: 2-8-16-7-6-13-19-1-4-12-15-8
- Cycle 4: 2-8-15-12-4-1-19-13-6-7-16-2
- Cycle 5: 2-11-17-14-13-6-7-16-8-2

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 17-14-13-19-17 has chord (13, 19)

Step 3:
The total number of chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<17, 13, 19, 14>
