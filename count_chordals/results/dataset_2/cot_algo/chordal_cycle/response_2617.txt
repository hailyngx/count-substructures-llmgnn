Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (8, 18), 4, 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (2, 13), 7, 1>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (7, 13), 2, 1>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, (11, 17), 14, 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, (5, 15), 16, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordless cycles in the graph is [55].
