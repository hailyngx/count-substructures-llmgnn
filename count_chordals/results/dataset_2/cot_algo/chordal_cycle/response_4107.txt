        - <19, 13, 7, 0>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

        - <6, 5, 17, 20> (Chord: 17-20)
        - <9, 18, 22, 12> (Chord: 18-22)
        - <18, 23, 8, 24> (Chord: 8-24)
        - <22, 12, 14, 28> (Chord: 12-14)
        - <5, 6, 27, 20> (Chord: 6-20)
        - <2, 24, 16, 12> (Chord: 16-12)
        - <4, 29, 25, 2> (Chord: 29-2)
        - <11, 28, 14, 20> (Chord: 14-20)
        - <17, 20, 27, 21> (Chord: 20-27)
        - <0, 3, 9, 8> (Chord: 3-9)
        - <7, 16, 24, 8> (Chord: 16-24)
        - <12, 22, 18, 23> (Chord: 22-18)
        - <29, 25, 10, 5> (Chord: 25-10)
        - <24, 15, 25, 29> (Chord: 15-29)
        - <26, 0, 7, 13> (Chord: 0-7)
        - <27, 6, 5, 10> (Chord: 6-5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

        There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [16].
