Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle 1: 0-4-8-7-0
2. Cycle 2: 0-3-7-8-0
3. Cycle 3: 1-4-8-9-1
4. Cycle 4: 1-5-7-8-1
5. Cycle 5: 2-3-4-9-2
6. Cycle 6: 3-4-8-9-3
7. Cycle 7: 3-7-6-5-3
8. Cycle 8: 4-8-7-6-4
9. Cycle 9: 5-9-8-7-5

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
Checking Cycle 1: 0-4-8-7-0 (Chords: 4-7)
Checking Cycle 2: 0-3-7-8-0 (Chords: 3-8)
Checking Cycle 3: 1-4-8-9-1 (Chords: 4-9)
Checking Cycle 4: 1-5-7-8-1 (Chords: 5-8)
Checking Cycle 5: 2-3-4-9-2 (Chords: 3-4)
Checking Cycle 6: 3-4-8-9-3 (Chords: 4-8)
Checking Cycle 7: 3-7-6-5-3 (Chords: 7-6)
Checking Cycle 8: 4-8-7-6-4 (Chords: 8-7)
Checking Cycle 9: 5-9-8-7-5 (Chords: 9-7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [] as there are no chordless cycles. 

Please note that the unique chordal 4-cycles found are <0, (4, 7)> <1, (4, 9)> <2, (3, 8)> <3, (5, 8)> <4, (3, 4)> <5, (4, 8)> <6, (6, 7)> <7, (7, 8)> <8, (7, 9)>.
