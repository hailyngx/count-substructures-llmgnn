Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 7, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 9, 4, 0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 7, 5, 6, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 9, 8, 2, 3)
- Cycle 6: (4, 7, 0, 6, 4)
- Cycle 7: (0, 4, 7, 5, 0)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (6, 5)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (8, 3)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (0, 6)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (4, 7)


Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (5, 3), 6)>
<3, (7, 3), 1)>
<9, (9, 4), 1)>
<6, (6, 5), 3)>
<3, (8, 3), 9)>
<4, (0, 6), 7)>
<0, (4, 7), 5)>
