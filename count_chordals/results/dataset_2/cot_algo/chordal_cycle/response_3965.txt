Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 16) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 0) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 18) (5, 3) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 19) (2, 9) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 6) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 2) (13, 17) (13, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 9) (18, 8) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 12) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 3-15-16-17-3
- Cycle 2: 4-8-1-6-4
- Cycle 3: 4-19-5-3-4
- Cycle 4: 9-10-11-0-9

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (15, 17)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (8, 6)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (19, 3)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (10, 0)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<3, 15, 16, 17> (15, 17)
<4, 8, 1, 6> (8, 6)
<4, 19, 5, 3> (19, 3)
<9, 10, 11, 0> (10, 0)
