Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 5 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 2 - 5 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 3: 1 - 5 - 4 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 7 - 5 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 5: 4 - 8 - 9 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 6: 4 - 5 - 2 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 7: 6 - 5 - 4 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 8: 6 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 9: 6 - 7 - 1 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 10: 7 - 5 - 2 - 0 - 7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Potential chordal 4-cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 5 - 4 - 0 with chord (1, 5) 
- Potential chordal 4-cycle 2: 0 - 2 - 5 - 4 - 0 with chord (2, 5)
- Potential chordal 4-cycle 3: 1 - 5 - 4 - 8 - 1 with chord (5, 8)
- Potential chordal 4-cycle 4: 1 - 7 - 5 - 2 - 1 with chord (7, 5)
- Potential chordal 4-cycle 5: 4 - 8 - 9 - 1 - 4 with chord (8, 1)
- Potential chordal 4-cycle 6: 4 - 5 - 2 - 3 - 4 with chord (5, 3)
- Not chordal
- Not chordal
- Potential chordal 4-cycle 7: 6 - 5 - 4 - 8 - 6 with chord (5, 8)
- Potential chordal 4-cycle 8: 6 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 6 with chord (4, 3)
- Potential chordal 4-cycle 9: 6 - 7 - 1 - 9 - 6 with chord (7, 9) 
- Potential chordal 4-cycle 10: 7 - 5 - 2 - 0 - 7 with chord (5, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count is [6]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are as follows:
- <0, 1, 5, 4> with chord (1, 5)
- <0, 2, 5, 4> with chord (2, 5)
- <1, 5, 4, 8> with chord (5, 8)
- <1, 7, 5, 2> with chord (7, 5)
- <4, 8, 9, 1> with chord (8, 1)
- <7, 5, 2, 0> with chord (5, 2)
