Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 6-9-1-6
        - Cycle 2: 6-2-7-5-6
        - Cycle 3: 9-8-7-5-9
        - Cycle 4: 9-0-7-5-9
        - Cycle 5: 9-1-7-5-9
        - Cycle 6: 9-0-3-8-9
        - Cycle 7: 5-1-0-7-5
        - Cycle 8: 2-6-9-1-2
        - Cycle 9: 8-9-1-0-8
        - Cycle 10: 8-7-0-3-8
        - Cycle 11: 0-9-1-6-0
        - Cycle 12: 0-7-1-6-0
        - Cycle 13: 0-7-5-1-0
        - Cycle 14: 0-7-3-8-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - <6, (1, 9), 6>
        - <6, (2, 5), 7, 6>
        - <9, (7, 5), 8, 9>
        - <9, (0, 5), 7, 9>
        - <9, (1, 5), 7, 9>
        - <9, (3, 8), 0, 9>
        - <5, (0, 7), 1, 5>
        - <2, (1, 9), 6, 2>
        - <8, (0, 1), 9, 8>
        - <8, (0, 3), 7, 8>
        - <0, (1, 6), 9, 0>
        - <0, (1, 7), 6, 0>
        - <0, (5, 1), 7, 0>
        - <0, (3, 8), 7, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
