Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 27) (21, 10) (21, 16) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 29) (12, 8) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 11) (27, 1) (27, 12) (28, 1) (28, 3) (28, 14) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 4) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (22, 0) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (13, 20) (13, 15) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 17) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 16) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 6) (6, 26) (6, 3) (6, 24) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 7) (16, 21) (16, 10) (16, 14) (11, 12) (11, 5) (0, 8) (0, 22) (0, 25) (2, 23) (2, 9) (2, 25) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 7) (4, 29) (4, 5) (4, 20) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 13) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 19) (7, 24) (7, 14) (19, 10) (19, 20) (25, 29) (25, 0) (25, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph where every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-27-12-8-1
- Cycle 2: 8-23-29-4-8
- Cycle 3: 12-27-1-28-12
- Cycle 4: 26-1-28-3-26
- Cycle 5: 10-26-1-27-10
- Cycle 6: 5-11-12-27-5
- Cycle 7: 6-26-18-15-6
- Cycle 8: 7-24-6-3-7
- Cycle 9: 2-23-8-0-2
- Cycle 10: 14-8-12-27-14
- Cycle 11: 20-13-15-18-20
- Cycle 12: 16-21-10-26-16
- Cycle 13: 17-12-27-1-17
- Cycle 14: 25-29-4-5-25
- Cycle 15: 22-0-8-12-22
- Cycle 16: 19-10-26-18-19

Step 2:
Among these cycles, there are three chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (12, 8), 27, 28>
- <26, (1, 28), 3, 18>
- <10, (26, 1), 27, 16>

Step 3:
As there are three chordal 4-cycles found, the final count of chordless cycles is [13].
