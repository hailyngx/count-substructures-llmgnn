Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-6-4-9-5 (of length 5)
- Cycle 2: 5-7-1-3-2-5 (of length 5)
- Cycle 3: 5-7-1-2-9-5 (of length 5)
- Cycle 4: 5-0-4-6-1-5 (of length 5)
- Cycle 5: 5-0-4-9-2-5 (of length 5)
- Cycle 6: 5-0-3-1-2-5 (of length 5)
- Cycle 7: 5-9-4-8-7-5 (of length 5)
- Cycle 8: 9-2-1-3-0-9 (of length 5)
- Cycle 9: 9-4-8-7-2-9 (of length 5)
- Cycle 10: 6-1-7-5-9-6 (of length 5)
- Cycle 11: 6-4-9-2-1-6 (of length 5)
- Cycle 12: 1-3-0-4-9-1 (of length 5)
- Cycle 13: 1-7-5-9-2-1 (of length 5)
- Cycle 14: 1-3-2-9-5-1 (of length 5)
- Cycle 15: 3-0-4-6-1-3 (of length 5)
- Cycle 16: 3-1-2-9-4-3 (of length 5)
- Cycle 17: 4-0-7-5-1-4 (of length 5)
- Cycle 18: 4-8-7-5-1-4 (of length 5)
- Cycle 19: 4-9-2-7-0-4 (of length 5)
- Cycle 20: 8-9-2-1-7-8 (of length 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <5, (1, 6), 4>
- <5, (7, 1), 3>
- <5, (7, 1), 2>
- <5, (0, 4), 9>
- <5, (0, 4), 2>
- <5, (0, 3), 1>
- <5, (9, 4), 8>
- <9, (2, 1), 3>
- <9, (4, 8), 7>
- <6, (1, 7), 5>
- <6, (4, 9), 2>
- <1, (3, 0), 4>
- <1, (7, 5), 9>
- <1, (3, 2), 5>
- <3, (0, 4), 6>
- <3, (1, 2), 9>
- <4, (8, 7), 5>
- <4, (7, 1), 8>
- <4, (9, 2), 7>
- <8, (2, 1), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
