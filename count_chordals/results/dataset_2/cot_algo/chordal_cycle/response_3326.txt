Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <9, (26, 15), 4>, <9, (23, 15), 4>, <9, (26, 3), 28>, <9, 23, (15, 4)>, <9, 23, (1, 29)>
- <4, (15, 26), 8>, <4, (6, 22), 8>, <4, (15, 23), 20>, <4, (8, 13), 15>, <4, 6, (25, 8)>
- <13, (15, 4), 8>, <13, 27, (10, 3)>, <13, 27, (2, 22)>, <16, 28, (3, 26)>, <16, 28, (14, 11)>
- <20, (4, 15), 18>, <25, 6, (4, 8)>, <27, (13, 15), 4>, <27, (13, 18), 10>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 18 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [18].
