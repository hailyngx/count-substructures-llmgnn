Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 0, 8, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 9, 0, 11, 21, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 9, 0, 29, 22, 11, 8, 20, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 9, 0, 29, 26, 4, 24, 19, 29, 0, 11, 21, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 13, 25, 3, 6, 2, 17, 10, 15, 7, 18, 26, 4, 24, 19, 29, 22, 11, 21, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (5, 13, 25, 3, 6, 2, 17, 10, 15, 7, 27, 2, 6, 26, 18, 7, 15, 23, 17, 6)
        - Cycle 7: (5, 20, 8, 11, 21, 5)
        - Cycle 8: (5, 20, 8, 11, 22, 29, 0, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 9: (5, 20, 8, 22, 29, 0, 9, 13, 25, 3, 6, 2, 17, 10, 15, 7, 18, 26, 4, 24, 19, 29, 22)
        - Cycle 10: (5, 20, 16, 20, 8, 11, 21, 5)
        - Cycle 11: (5, 20, 16, 20, 8, 22, 29, 0, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 12: (5, 20, 16, 20, 8, 22, 29, 0, 11, 21, 5)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1 has 0 chord.
        - Cycle 2 has 0 chord.
        - Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (0, 29)
        - Cycle 4 has 0 chord.
        - Cycle 5 has 0 chord.
        - Cycle 6 has 0 chord.
        - Cycle 7 has 0 chord.
        - Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (8, 20)
        - Cycle 9 has 0 chord.
        - Cycle 10 has 0 chord.
        - Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (8, 22)
        - Cycle 12 has 1 chord: (8, 11)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        There are [4] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
        
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        <3, (0, 29), 0, 13>
        <8, (8, 20), 20, 16>
        <8, (8, 22), 29, 0>
        <8, (8, 11), 11, 21>
