Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- 5-9-6-4
- 5-9-8-10
- 5-11-10-8
- 9-8-2-11
- 9-12-4-3
- 6-4-3-12
- 10-8-2-7
- 10-1-6-4
- 11-2-8-7
- 11-13-1-6
- 2-8-1-14
- 2-7-5-9
- 8-10-1-14
- 8-2-12-4
- 8-7-5-9
- 0-14-1-6
- 14-12-4-3
- 3-12-2-7
- 4-6-1-10
- 4-3-12-14
- 12-9-5-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- 5-9-6-4 <(5, 6)>
- 5-9-8-10 <(9, 10)>
- 5-11-10-8 <(5, 10)>
- 9-8-2-11 <(8, 11)>
- 9-12-4-3 <(9, 4)>
- 6-4-3-12 <(6, 3)>
- 10-8-2-7 <(8, 2)>
- 10-1-6-4 <(10, 6)>
- 11-2-8-7 <(2, 11)>
- 11-13-1-6 <(13, 6)>
- 2-8-1-14 <(8, 14)>
- 2-7-5-9 <(5, 7)>
- 8-10-1-14 <(10, 1)>
- 8-2-12-4 <(8, 12)>
- 8-7-5-9 <(5, 8)>
- 0-14-1-6 <(0, 1)>
- 14-12-4-3 <(12, 3)>
- 3-12-2-7 <(12, 7)>
- 4-6-1-10 <(6, 10)>
- 4-3-12-14 <(3, 4)>
- 12-9-5-7 <(9, 5)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are [21] chordal 4-cycles. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 9, 6, 4> with chord (5, 6)
<5, 9, 8, 10> with chord (9, 10)
<5, 11, 10, 8> with chord (5, 10)
<9, 8, 2, 11> with chord (8, 11)
<9, 12, 4, 3> with chord (9, 4)
<6, 4, 3, 12> with chord (6, 3)
<10, 8, 2, 7> with chord (8, 2)
<10, 1, 6, 4> with chord (10, 6)
<11, 2, 8, 7> with chord (2, 11)
<11, 13, 1, 6> with chord (13, 6)
<2, 8, 1, 14> with chord (8, 14)
<2, 7, 5, 9> with chord (5, 7)
<8, 10, 1, 14> with chord (10, 1)
<8, 2, 12, 4> with chord (8, 12)
<8, 7, 5, 9> with chord (5, 8)
<0, 14, 1, 6> with chord (0, 1)
<14, 12, 4, 3> with chord (12, 3)
<3, 12, 2, 7> with chord (12, 7)
<4, 6, 1, 10> with chord (6, 10)
<4, 3, 12, 14> with chord (3, 4)
<12, 9, 5, 7> with chord (9, 5)
