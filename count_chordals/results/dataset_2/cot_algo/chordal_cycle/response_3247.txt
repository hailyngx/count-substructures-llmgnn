Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-4-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-4-8-6
- Cycle 3: 6-9-4-3-6
- Cycle 4: 6-9-1-7-6
- Cycle 5: 6-9-1-5-6
- Cycle 6: 6-9-2-7-6
- Cycle 7: 6-9-2-3-6
- Cycle 8: 6-4-9-2-6
- Cycle 9: 6-4-9-3-6
- Cycle 10: 6-4-3-2-6
- Cycle 11: 6-8-4-9-6
- Cycle 12: 6-8-4-3-6
- Cycle 13: 6-0-7-1-6
- Cycle 14: 6-0-7-2-6
- Cycle 15: 6-0-2-5-6

Step 2:
For each cycle from Step 1, check for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: <6, 4>
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <6, 8>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <6, 4>
- Cycle 4 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 5 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <6, 2>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <6, 2>
- Cycle 8 has a chord: <6, 3>
- Cycle 9 has a chord: <6, 3>
- Cycle 10 has a chord: <6, 4>
- Cycle 11 has a chord: <6, 9>
- Cycle 12 has a chord: <6, 8>
- Cycle 13 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 14 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 15 does not have exactly one chord

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <6, 4, 9, 6>
- <6, 8, 4, 9, 6>
- <6, 9, 4, 3, 6>
- <6, 9, 2, 7, 6>
- <6, 4, 9, 2, 6>
- <6, 4, 9, 3, 6>
- <6, 8, 4, 3, 6>
- <6, 9, 3, 2, 6>
