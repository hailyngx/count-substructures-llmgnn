Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 17) (16, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (18, 19) (5, 14) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (15, 1) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 13) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 3) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 17) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4: 
    - (11, 1, 10, 4)
    - (17, 16, 6, 4)
    - (17, 5, 14, 9)
    - (5, 19, 18, 11)
    - (19, 8, 0, 4)
    - (19, 5, 14, 9)
    - (10, 4, 9, 13)
    - (1, 11, 19, 5)
    - (0, 4, 10, 1)
    - (6, 16, 17, 5)
    
Step 2:
- Checking for chords:
    - <1, (10, 4), 11>
    - <16, (6, 4), 17>
    - <5, (14, 9), 17>
    - <19, (18, 11), 5>
    - <8, (0, 4), 19>
    - <19, (14, 9), 5>
    - <10, (4, 9), 13>
    - <11, (19, 5), 1>
    - <4, (10, 1), 0>
    - <17, (16, 6), 5>

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (10, 4), 11>
- <16, (6, 4), 17>
- <5, (14, 9), 17>
- <19, (18, 11), 5>
- <8, (0, 4), 19>
- <19, (14, 9), 5>
- <10, (4, 9), 13>
- <11, (19, 5), 1>
- <4, (10, 1), 0>
- <17, (16, 6), 5>
