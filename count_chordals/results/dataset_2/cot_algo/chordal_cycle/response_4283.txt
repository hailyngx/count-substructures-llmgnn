Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-6-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-9-6-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-8-9-6-0
- Cycle 4: 0-8-1-2-0
- Cycle 5: 0-7-1-2-0
- Cycle 6: 0-7-3-2-0
- Cycle 7: 0-5-3-2-0
- Cycle 8: 0-5-7-1-0
- Cycle 9: 0-5-4-6-0
- Cycle 10: 0-5-4-3-0

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (2, 6), 4>  (Cycle 1)

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
