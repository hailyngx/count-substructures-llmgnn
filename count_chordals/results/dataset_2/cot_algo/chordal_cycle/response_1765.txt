Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles with length 4:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-2-3-1
- Cycle 2: 4-5-13-12-4
- Cycle 3: 7-3-2-6-7
- Cycle 4: 8-9-14-0-8
- Cycle 5: 10-12-13-7-10
- Cycle 6: 11-4-1-3-11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 3, 6, 2>
- <4, 13, 12, 5>
- <7, 2, 6, 3>
- <8, 0, 14, 9>
- <11, 4, 1, 3>
- <10, 12, 13, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
