Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 19) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 9) (19, 5) (19, 3) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (3, 19) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 0) (16, 17) (16, 10) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 1) (15, 9) (15, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (18, 13) (18, 3) (10, 7) (10, 16) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

Candidate cycles: 
1. Cycle 1: (6, 9, 11, 6)
2. Cycle 2: (6, 9, 19, 5, 14, 7, 12, 6)
3. Cycle 3: (7, 12, 4, 13, 17, 7)
4. Cycle 4: (9, 19, 3, 0, 9)
5. Cycle 5: (13, 17, 16, 10, 8, 6, 12, 13)
6. Cycle 6: (1, 4, 12, 7, 14, 5, 19, 3, 1)
7. Cycle 7: (11, 6, 12, 7, 14, 5, 19, 9, 11)
8. Cycle 8: (2, 13, 17, 7, 14, 5, 19, 3, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <1, (6, 11), 9>
2. <2, (12, 7), 6>
3. <3, (4, 13), 17>
4. <4, (0, 9), 19>
5. <5, (10, 8), 6>
6. <6, (1, 4), 12>
7. <7, (11, 9), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
