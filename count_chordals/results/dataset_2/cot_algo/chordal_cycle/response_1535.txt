Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 9, 11, 5)
- (8, 12, 6, 8)
- (8, 12, 10, 8)
- (8, 12, 11, 8)
- (8, 12, 10, 6, 8)
- (8, 12, 10, 4, 8)
- (13, 7, 14, 13)
- (0, 9, 11, 0)
- (1, 14, 7, 1)
- (1, 14, 4, 1)
- (2, 6, 12, 2)
- (2, 7, 11, 2)
- (4, 11, 7, 4)
- (4, 11, 12, 4)
- (7, 11, 12, 7)
- (6, 14, 1, 6)
- (6, 14, 4, 6)
- (10, 8, 12, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle found:
- <5, 9, 11, (12, 8, 6)>
- <8, 12, 10, (6, 4, 8)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 17 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
