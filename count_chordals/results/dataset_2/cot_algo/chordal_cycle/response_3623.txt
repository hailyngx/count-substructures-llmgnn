Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-7-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-7-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-8-7-4-0
- Cycle 4: 0-8-7-5-0
- Cycle 5: 0-1-8-7-0
- Cycle 6: 0-1-5-7-0
- Cycle 7: 1-5-7-4-1
- Cycle 8: 1-8-7-4-1
- Cycle 9: 4-7-2-3-4
- Cycle 10: 4-0-3-2-4

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, (4, 7), 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, (5, 4), 7>
- Cycle 3: <0, (8, 7), 4>
- Cycle 4: <0, (7, 5), 8>
- Cycle 5: <0, (1, 8), 7>
- Cycle 6: <0, (5, 7), 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, (5, 7), 4>
- Cycle 8: <1, (7, 4), 8>
- Cycle 9: <4, (2, 3), 7>
- Cycle 10: <4, (0, 2), 3>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
