Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 8) (15, 9) (15, 1) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 10) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 0) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (12, 3) (12, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 11) (5, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (18, 12) (18, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

Cycles of length 4:
- (11, 7, 4, 5, 11)
- (11, 16, 19, 0, 11)
- (11, 7, 19, 0, 11)
- (11, 5, 4, 0, 11)
  
Cycles of length 5:
- (11, 7, 4, 0, 19, 11)
- (11, 5, 4, 7, 11, 16)
- (16, 0, 4, 7, 11, 16)
- (16, 19, 0, 4, 7, 16)
- (16, 11, 7, 4, 5, 16)
- (6, 9, 15, 1, 17, 6)
- (6, 14, 7, 11, 5, 6)
- (6, 2, 14, 7, 11, 6)
- (6, 8, 10, 0, 19, 6)
- (9, 15, 1, 3, 12, 9)
- (4, 7, 11, 5, 4, 14)
- (4, 0, 10, 8, 4, 7)
- (7, 11, 5, 4, 0, 7)
- (7, 19, 0, 4, 10, 7)
- (7, 14, 2, 6, 9, 7)
- (7, 13, 1, 15, 9, 7)
- (1, 3, 12, 18, 13, 1)
- (1, 17, 16, 11, 7, 1)
- (3, 1, 15, 9, 6, 3)
- (17, 16, 11, 7, 14, 17)
- (10, 8, 17, 1, 3, 10)
- (8, 6, 2, 14, 7, 8)
- (19, 16, 11, 7, 14, 19)
- (0, 4, 10, 8, 6, 0)
- (12, 3, 1, 17, 8, 12)
- (2, 6, 14, 7, 13, 2)
- (5, 11, 7, 4, 0, 5)
- (14, 7, 11, 5, 4, 14)
- (18, 12, 3, 1, 17, 18)
- (13, 7, 11, 5, 4, 13)


Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only the cycle (11, 7, 4, 5, 11) has exactly one chord (11, 4).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [29]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <1, (11, 4), 5>
