Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 5 -> 9 -> 4 -> 5
- Cycle 2: 5 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5
- Cycle 3: 5 -> 1 -> 10 -> 5
- Cycle 4: 5 -> 4 -> 12 -> 5
- Cycle 5: 9 -> 3 -> 4 -> 9
- Cycle 6: 9 -> 1 -> 13 -> 9
- Cycle 7: 9 -> 10 -> 5 -> 9
- Cycle 8: 1 -> 6 -> 3 -> 1
- Cycle 9: 1 -> 10 -> 8 -> 1
- Cycle 10: 3 -> 9 -> 4 -> 3
- Cycle 11: 3 -> 0 -> 12 -> 3
- Cycle 12: 3 -> 8 -> 14 -> 3
- Cycle 13: 7 -> 6 -> 1 -> 7
- Cycle 14: 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 7
- Cycle 15: 7 -> 6 -> 11 -> 7
- Cycle 16: 12 -> 0 -> 3 -> 12
- Cycle 17: 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0
- Cycle 18: 0 -> 2 -> 6 -> 0
- Cycle 19: 4 -> 3 -> 9 -> 4
- Cycle 20: 4 -> 12 -> 0 -> 4
- Cycle 21: 6 -> 1 -> 13 -> 6
- Cycle 22: 6 -> 13 -> 2 -> 6
- Cycle 23: 6 -> 11 -> 7 -> 6
- Cycle 24: 11 -> 7 -> 6 -> 11
- Cycle 25: 14 -> 7 -> 6 -> 14
- Cycle 26: 14 -> 8 -> 1 -> 14
- Cycle 27: 2 -> 0 -> 12 -> 2
- Cycle 28: 8 -> 1 -> 5 -> 8
- Cycle 29: 8 -> 10 -> 1 -> 8
- Cycle 30: 8 -> 14 -> 7 -> 8
- Cycle 31: 10 -> 5 -> 9 -> 10
- Cycle 32: 10 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10
- Cycle 33: 10 -> 8 -> 14 -> 10
- Cycle 34: 13 -> 9 -> 4 -> 13
- Cycle 35: 13 -> 6 -> 1 -> 13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (4, 12)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (1, 13)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (0, 12)
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: (8, 14)
- Cycle 13 has 1 chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 14 has 1 chord: (6, 3)
- Cycle 15 has 1 chord: (6, 11)
- Cycle 17 has 1 chord: (3, 4)
- Cycle 18 has 1 chord: (2, 6)
- Cycle 19 has 1 chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 21 has 1 chord: (1, 13)
- Cycle 22 has 1 chord: (6, 13)
- Cycle 23 has 1 chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 24 has 1 chord: (6, 11)
- Cycle 25 has 1 chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 26 has 1 chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 27 has 1 chord: (0, 12)
- Cycle 28 has 1 chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 30 has 1 chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 33 has 1 chord: (8, 14)
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 9 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, 9, 4, 5>
<5, 1, 6, 5>
<5, 1, 10, 5>
<1, 6, 3, 1>
<9, 10, 5, 9>
<13, 9, 4, 13>
<13, 6, 1, 13>
<2, 0, 12, 2>
<8, 10, 1, 8>
