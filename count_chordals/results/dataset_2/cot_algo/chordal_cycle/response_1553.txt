Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 16) (8, 18) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (0, 17) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 12) (10, 4) (10, 16) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 11) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 18) (5, 4) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (3, 14) (3, 9) (16, 8) (16, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 17) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 3) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: (1, 13, 7, 1)  
- Cycle 2: (1, 13, 7, 11, 1)  
- Cycle 3: (1, 13, 7, 11, 18, 14, 1)  
- Cycle 4: (1, 13, 7, 11, 18, 14, 6, 1)  
- Cycle 5: (1, 13, 7, 11, 18, 14, 3, 9, 1)  
- Cycle 6: (1, 13, 7, 11, 18, 14, 3, 9, 3, 1)  
- Cycle 7: (1, 13, 7, 11, 18, 14, 6, 19, 17, 2, 4, 10, 16, 8, 18, 11, 7, 1)  
- Cycle 8: (1, 15, 12, 11, 7, 13, 19, 6, 0, 17, 2, 5, 4, 10, 16, 8, 18, 11, 12, 15, 1)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).  
From the cycles listed above, the following chordal 4-cycle is found:  
<1, 13, 7, 11>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found above.  
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
