Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 16) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (17, 1) (17, 4) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 18) (7, 5) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 14) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 4) (13, 9) (18, 6) (19, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 1) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 16) (16, 15) (16, 4) 

Response:
Following Step 1:
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
    - Cycle 1: 3 - 15 - 16 - 4 - 3
    - Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 11 - 8 - 5
    - Cycle 3: 5 - 11 - 8 - 12 - 5
    - Cycle 4: 12 - 8 - 14 - 2 - 12
    - Cycle 5: 4 - 16 - 15 - 8 - 4

Following Step 2:
- Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
    - Cycle 1: 3 - 15 - 16 - 4 - 3 has exactly one chord 15-4
    - Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 11 - 8 - 5 has exactly one chord 9-8
    - Cycle 3: 5 - 11 - 8 - 12 - 5 has exactly one chord 11-12
    - Cycle 4: 12 - 8 - 14 - 2 - 12 has exactly one chord 8-14
    - Cycle 5: 4 - 16 - 15 - 8 - 4 has exactly one chord 16-15

Following Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
    - The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Thus, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- Cycle <3, 15-4, 16>
- Cycle <5, 9-8, 11>
- Cycle <5, 11-12, 8>
- Cycle <12, 8-14, 2>
- Cycle <4, 16-15, 8>
