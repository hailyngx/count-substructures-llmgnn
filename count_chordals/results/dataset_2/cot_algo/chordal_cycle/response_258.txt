Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-3-6
- Cycle 2: 6-5-3-6
- Cycle 3: 6-8-4-5
- Cycle 4: 6-3-2-5
- Cycle 5: 6-0-8-7
- Cycle 6: 9-8-4-5
- Cycle 7: 9-3-2-5
- Cycle 8: 9-0-8-7
- Cycle 9: 3-2-4-5
- Cycle 10: 3-5-7-2
- Cycle 11: 8-4-2-5
- Cycle 12: 8-7-5-2
- Cycle 13: 8-0-6-9
- Cycle 14: 5-2-4-8
- Cycle 15: 5-7-8-4

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <6, 9, 3, 6> - Chord: (9, 3)
- <6, 5, 3, 6> - Chord: (5, 3)
- <6, 8, 4, 5> - Chord: (8, 4)
- <6, 3, 2, 5> - Chord: (3, 5)
- <6, 0, 8, 7> - Chord: (0, 8)
- <9, 8, 4, 5> - Chord: (8, 5)
- <9, 3, 2, 5> - Chord: (3, 5)
- <9, 0, 8, 7> - Chord: (0, 8)
- <3, 2, 4, 5> - Chord: (2, 5)
- <3, 5, 7, 2> - Chord: (5, 7)
- <8, 4, 2, 5> - Chord: (4, 5)
- <8, 7, 5, 2> - Chord: (7, 5)
- <8, 0, 6, 9> - Chord: (0, 9)
- <5, 2, 4, 8> - Chord: (2, 4)
- <5, 7, 8, 4> - Chord: (7, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
