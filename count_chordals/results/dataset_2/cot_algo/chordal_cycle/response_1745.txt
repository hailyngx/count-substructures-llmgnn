Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 25) (15, 29) (15, 24) (27, 10) (27, 20) (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (21, 7) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 29) (20, 27) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 19) (20, 28) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 0) (25, 2) (2, 25) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 17) (4, 13) (4, 23) (8, 20) (8, 11) (6, 5) (6, 24) (6, 23) (6, 0) (19, 21) (19, 20) (19, 26) (26, 18) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 11) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 26) (28, 20) (28, 17) (28, 12) (16, 7) (16, 17) (24, 15) (24, 6) (24, 12) (22, 14) (22, 1) (3, 23) (1, 2) (1, 22) (1, 29) (1, 10) (29, 15) (29, 21) (29, 1) (29, 12) (14, 18) (14, 22) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 16) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 6) (23, 3) (0, 21) (0, 25) (0, 6) (10, 27) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 12) (12, 28) (12, 24) (12, 29) (12, 10) (11, 8) (11, 26) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (9, 5, 6, 24, 15, 25, 20, 27, 10, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 10, 27, 20, 19, 21, 7, 16, 17, 18, 26, 13, 2, 25, 15, 24, 6, 5, 9)
- Cycle 3: (7, 21, 29, 1, 2, 13, 26, 18, 17, 16, 7)
- Cycle 4: (15, 29, 1, 2, 13, 26, 18, 22, 14, 23, 4, 6, 0, 25, 20, 27, 10, 9, 15)
- Cycle 5: (15, 24, 6, 23, 3, 4, 13, 26, 19, 20, 28, 17, 16, 7, 21, 0, 25, 15)
- Cycle 6: (27, 10, 1, 29, 21, 20, 28, 17, 18, 26, 13, 2, 25, 0, 6, 24, 12, 29, 15, 25, 20, 27)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Checking Cycle 1, we find a chord (9, 24).
- Checking Cycle 2, we find a chord (9, 27).
- Checking Cycle 3, we find a chord (21, 16).
- Checking Cycle 4, we find a chord (26, 22).
- Checking Cycle 5, we find a chord (24, 28).
- Checking Cycle 6, we find a chord (1, 28).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <9, (9, 24), 5, 6>
2. <9, (9, 27), 10, 27>
3. <21, (21, 16), 7, 29, 1>
4. <26, (26, 22), 14, 18>
5. <24, (24, 28), 6, 0, 25>
6. <1, (1, 28), 10, 29, 15>
