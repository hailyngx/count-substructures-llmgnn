Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
As there are no cycles of length 4 or more, we cannot find any chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3:
Since there are no chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [0].
