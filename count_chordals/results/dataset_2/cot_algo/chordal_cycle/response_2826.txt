Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 8) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 19) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 15) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 4) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 3) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 18) (16, 18) (15, 9) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 18) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (14, 17, 12, 4, 14)
- Cycle 2: (7, 0, 4, 12, 7)
- Cycle 3: (19, 10, 4, 12, 19)
- Cycle 4: (18, 19, 2, 4, 18)
- Cycle 5: (8, 17, 6, 18, 8)
- Cycle 6: (9, 14, 1, 7, 9)
- Cycle 7: (11, 8, 17, 12, 11)
- Cycle 8: (5, 0, 7, 1, 5)
- Cycle 9: (13, 7, 1, 4, 13)
- Cycle 10: (3, 18, 19, 10, 3)
- Cycle 11: (15, 9, 14, 1, 15)
- Cycle 12: (6, 8, 17, 14, 6)
- Cycle 13: (16, 18, 6, 17, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (17, 4)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (4, 0)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (10, 12)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (19, 2)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (17, 18)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (14, 7)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (8, 12)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (0, 1)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (7, 4)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (18, 10)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (9, 1)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (8, 14)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (18, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 13 cycles with exactly one chord.

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
