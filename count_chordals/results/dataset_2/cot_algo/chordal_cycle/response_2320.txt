Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following chordal 4-cycle and its unique chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, 1, 6>
  - Chord: (0, 1, 5, 6)
