Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 6) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 4) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 19) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 15) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 17) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (16, 7) (16, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (19, 11) (19, 17) (8, 14) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (0, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 14, 11)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 7, 12, 9)
        - Cycle 3: (7, 6, 1, 18)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 3, 4, 10, 13)
        - Cycle 5: (17, 2, 14, 8)
        - Cycle 6: (6, 17, 12, 13)
        - Cycle 7: (15, 18, 2, 14)
        - Cycle 8: (13, 0, 13, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 14)
        - Cycle 2 has one chord: (7, 9)
        - Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 18)
        - Cycle 4 has one chord: (4, 10)
        - Cycle 5 has one chord: (2, 14)
        - Cycle 6 has one chord: (17, 13)
        - Cycle 7 has one chord: (18, 14)
        - Cycle 8 has one chord: (13, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (9, 14), 11)>, <2, (7, 9), 4)>, <3, (1, 18), 6)>, <4, (4, 10), 13)>, <5, (2, 14), 8)>, <6, (17, 13), 12)>, <7, (18, 14), 2)>, <8, (13, 10), 0)>
