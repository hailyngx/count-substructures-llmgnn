Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 15) (4, 17) (8, 11) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 15) (1, 5) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 13) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 17) (19, 9) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 12) (16, 10) (16, 17) (17, 4) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 15) (15, 4) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 17) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 5, 17)
- Cycle 2: (2, 15, 17, 5)
- Cycle 3: (3, 6, 7, 11)
- Cycle 4: (3, 6, 12, 13)
- Cycle 5: (6, 7, 11, 12)
- Cycle 6: (9, 14, 13, 12)
- Cycle 7: (9, 14, 3, 6)
- Cycle 8: (11, 12, 10, 16)
- Cycle 9: (15, 17, 16, 10)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 17)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (2, 5)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (6, 11)
- Cycle 4 is chordal <3, (6, 12), 13)>
- Cycle 5 has a chord (7, 12)
- Cycle 6 is chordal <9, (13, 14), 12)>
- Cycle 7 has a chord (3, 14)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (11, 16)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (15, 16)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, (6, 12), 13>
- <9, (13, 14), 12>
