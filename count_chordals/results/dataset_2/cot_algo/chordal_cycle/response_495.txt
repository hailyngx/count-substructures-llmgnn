Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 2, 5>
2. Cycle <5, 9, 4, 5>
3. Cycle <5, 7, 4, 5>
4. Cycle <6, 9, 4, 6>
5. Cycle <6, 4, 7, 6>
6. Cycle <6, 4, 2, 6>
7. Cycle <6, 1, 7, 6>
8. Cycle <4, 9, 6, 4>
9. Cycle <4, 7, 1, 4>
10. Cycle <7, 5, 9, 7>
11. Cycle <7, 0, 4, 7>
12. Cycle <1, 6, 4, 1>
13. Cycle <1, 7, 5, 1>
14. Cycle <2, 5, 9, 2>
15. Cycle <2, 4, 9, 2>
16. Cycle <2, 1, 7, 2>
17. Cycle <3, 6, 9, 3>
18. Cycle <8, 5, 9, 8>
19. Cycle <8, 4, 9, 8>
20. Cycle <8, 0, 7, 8>
21. Cycle <0, 9, 4, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
1. Chordal 4-cycle <5, (9, 2), 5>
2. Chordal 4-cycle <5, (4, 9), 5>
3. Chordal 4-cycle <5, (4, 7), 5>
4. Chordal 4-cycle <6, (4, 9), 6>
5. Chordal 4-cycle <6, (4, 7), 6>
6. Chordal 4-cycle <6, (4, 2), 6>
7. Chordal 4-cycle <6, (1, 7), 6>
8. Chordal 4-cycle <4, (9, 6), 4>
9. Chordal 4-cycle <4, (7, 1), 4>
10. Chordal 4-cycle <7, (5, 9), 7>
11. Chordal 4-cycle <7, (0, 4), 7>
12. Chordal 4-cycle <1, (6, 4), 1>
13. Chordal 4-cycle <1, (7, 5), 1>
14. Chordal 4-cycle <2, (5, 9), 2>
15. Chordal 4-cycle <2, (4, 9), 2>
16. Chordal 4-cycle <2, (1, 7), 2>
17. Chordal 4-cycle <3, (6, 9), 3>
18. Chordal 4-cycle <8, (5, 9), 8>
19. Chordal 4-cycle <8, (4, 9), 8>
20. Chordal 4-cycle <8, (0, 7), 8>
21. Chordal 4-cycle <0, (9, 4), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 21 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [21].
