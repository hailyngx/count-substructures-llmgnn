Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 1, 3, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 8, 4, 6)
- Cycle 3: (9, 1, 3, 7, 9)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 7, 4, 8, 3)
- Cycle 6: (7, 0, 5, 2, 7)
- Cycle 7: (0, 5, 2, 9, 0)
- Cycle 8: (5, 2, 1, 8, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Checking Cycle 1: (6, 9, 1, 3, 6) - Chord: (9, 3) - <1, (9, 3), 6>
- Checking Cycle 2: (6, 9, 8, 4, 6) - Chord: (9, 4) - <2, (9, 4), 6>
- Checking Cycle 3: (9, 1, 3, 7, 9) - Chord: (1, 7) - <3, (1, 7), 9>
- Checking Cycle 4: (1, 3, 7, 0, 1) - Chord: (3, 0) - <4, (3, 0), 1>
- Checking Cycle 5: (3, 7, 4, 8, 3) - Chord: (7, 8) - <5, (7, 8), 3>
- Checking Cycle 6: (7, 0, 5, 2, 7) - Chord: (0, 5) - <6, (0, 5), 7>
- Checking Cycle 7: (0, 5, 2, 9, 0) - Chord: (5, 2) - <7, (5, 2), 0>
- Checking Cycle 8: (5, 2, 1, 8, 5) - Chord: (2, 1) - <8, (2, 1), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
