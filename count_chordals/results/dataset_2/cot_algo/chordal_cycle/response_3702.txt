Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 15) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 18) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 10) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 19) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 12) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-10-2-13-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-10-2-12-3-14-1-9-15-16-0
        - Cycle 3: 0-10-2-12-3-13-5-4-9-1-14-17-18-6-0
        - Cycle 4: 1-14-3-12-2-10-0-6-18-17-4-9-15-16-0-7-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        Considering the cycles from Step 1:
        - Cycle 1 has no chords.
        - Cycle 2 has one chord: (2, 12).
        - Cycle 3 has one chord: (4, 1).
        - Cycle 4 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        Since there are 2 chordal cycles, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        - <0, 10, 2, 12, 3, 14, 1, 9>
        - <0, 10, 2, 12, 3, 13, 5, 4, 9, 1>
