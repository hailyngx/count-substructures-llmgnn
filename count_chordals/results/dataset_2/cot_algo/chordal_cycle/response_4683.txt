Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 5) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle <6, 1, 9, 0, 8, 6>
2. Cycle <6, 2, 7, 11, 6>
3. Cycle <6, 4, 9, 8, 6>
4. Cycle <6, 13, 10, 14, 6>
5. Cycle <9, 8, 12, 0, 9>
6. Cycle <9, 4, 8, 12, 9>
7. Cycle <8, 13, 10, 14, 8>
8. Cycle <13, 10, 14, 11, 13>
9. Cycle <4, 6, 1, 9, 4>
10. Cycle <4, 9, 3, 7, 4>
11. Cycle <4, 8, 0, 2, 4>
12. Cycle <12, 8, 9, 4, 12>
13. Cycle <0, 9, 3, 12, 0>
14. Cycle <14, 10, 13, 6, 14>
15. Cycle <3, 7, 11, 14, 3>
16. Cycle <11, 14, 1, 6, 11>
17. Cycle <1, 6, 2, 14, 1>
18. Cycle <10, 14, 11, 5, 10>
19. Cycle <2, 0, 8, 13, 2>
20. Cycle <5, 12, 0, 2, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (1, 9), 0, 8, 6>
2. Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (2, 7), 11, 6>
3. Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (4, 9), 8, 6>
4. Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (13, 10), 14, 6>
5. Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, (8, 12), 0, 9>
6. Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, (4, 8), 12, 9>
7. Chordal 4-cycle found: <8, (13, 10), 14, 8>
8. Chordal 4-cycle found: <13, (10, 14), 11, 13>
9. Chordal 4-cycle found: <4, (6, 1), 9, 4>
10. Chordal 4-cycle found: <4, (9, 3), 7, 4>
11. Chordal 4-cycle found: <4, (8, 0), 2, 4>
12. Chordal 4-cycle found: <12, (8, 9), 4, 12>
13. Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, (9, 3), 12, 0>
14. Chordal 4-cycle found: <14, (10, 13), 6, 14>
15. Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (7, 11), 14, 3>
16. Chordal 4-cycle found: <11, (14, 1), 6, 11>
17. Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (6, 2), 14, 1>
18. Chordal 4-cycle found: <10, (14, 11), 5, 10>
19. Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, (0, 8), 13, 2>
20. Chordal 4-cycle found: <5, (12, 0), 2, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [20].
