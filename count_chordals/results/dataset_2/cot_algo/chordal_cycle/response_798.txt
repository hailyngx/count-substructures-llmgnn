Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (13, 3), 10, 26, 28, 16, (22, 0), 12, 1>
- <3, (15, 0), 22, 16, 28, 26, (10, 3)>
- <0, (22, 16), 28, 26, 18, 23, 7, 6, (27, 0)>
- <0, (22, 16), 28, 26, 10, (3, 15)>
- <1, (13, 3), 15, 0, 12, 1>
- <1, (13, 3), 10, 26, 28, 16, (22, 0), 25, 23, 7, 6, (27, 0), 12, 1>
- <14, (0, 27), 8, 24, 5, 21, 17, 19, 8, 27, 29, 11, 14>
- <17, (21, 5), 24, 8, 19, 10, 3, 15, 0, 14, 17>
- <17, (21, 5), 18, 26, 10, 3, 13, 1, 12, 4, 6, 27, (29, 11), 17>
- <18, (26, 10), 3, 13, 1, 12, 0, 25, 23, 7, 6, 4, 12, 18>
- <2, (28, 26), 10, 3, 15, 0, 25, 23, 7, 6, 4, 12, 1, 19, 10, 26, 18, 5, 21, 17, 14, 11, 29, 6, 4, 6, 27, (29, 11), 9, 2>
- <5, (21, 17), 14, 0, 27, 6, 4, 12, 1, 13, 3, 10, 26, 28, 16, 22, 0, 25, 23, 7, 6, 29, (11, 17), 5>
- <6, 27, 0, 25, 23, 7, 6, 29, (11, 14), 0, 22, 16, 28, 26, 18, 5, 21, 17, 19, 10, 3, 13, 1, 12, 6>
- <7, 6, 4, 12, 0, 27, 29, (11, 14), 9, 2, 28, 16, 22, 0, 12, 1, 19, 8, 27, 29, (6, 7)>
- <11, (14, 0), 22, 16, 28, 2, 9, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [14].
