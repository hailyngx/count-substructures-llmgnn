Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 11) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 12) (11, 17) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 15) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: First, let's list all the cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 7, 4, 1>
2. <0, 7, 4, 16>
3. <0, 7, 19, 12>
4. <1, 4, 16, 10>
5. <1, 3, 5, 14>
6. <1, 3, 8, 13>
7. <1, 13, 7, 19>
8. <3, 5, 14, 13>
9. <4, 7, 19, 13>
10. <6, 9, 18, 17>
11. <7, 4, 16, 10>
12. <7, 19, 12, 9>
13. <9, 6, 10, 7>
14. <10, 7, 4, 1>
15. <10, 7, 19, 12>
16. <10, 16, 4, 1>
17. <12, 9, 18, 17>
18. <12, 14, 5, 3>
19. <12, 19, 7, 4>
20. <13, 1, 4, 7>
21. <13, 1, 3, 8>
22. <13, 7, 4, 16>
23. <14, 5, 3, 1>
24. <14, 12, 19, 7>
25. <15, 16, 4, 1>
26. <16, 4, 7, 0>
27. <16, 10, 6, 9>
28. <17, 1, 4, 7>
29. <17, 6, 9, 18>
30. <17, 18, 9, 6>
31. <18, 9, 6, 10>
32. <19, 7, 4, 1>
33. <19, 7, 10, 16>
34. <19, 12, 14, 5>

Step 2: Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- From the listed cycles, only the following cycles have exactly one non-adjacent chord:
    1. <1, 4, 16, 10> with chord (4, 10)
    2. <12, 9, 18, 17> with chord (9, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
   There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found which are <1, 4, 16, 10> and <12, 9, 18, 17>. 
   So the final count is [2].
