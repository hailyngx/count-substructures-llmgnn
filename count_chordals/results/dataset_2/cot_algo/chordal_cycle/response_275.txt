Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 14) (16, 15) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 17) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (17, 18) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 15) (12, 8) (12, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (11, 7, 19, 5, 11)
- Cycle 2: (7, 15, 16, 14, 7)
- Cycle 3: (5, 19, 3, 14, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 1, 4, 8, 9)
- Cycle 5: (4, 18, 17, 12, 4)
- Cycle 6: (8, 12, 18, 17, 8)
- Cycle 7: (2, 4, 1, 14, 2)
- Cycle 8: (0, 6, 5, 19, 0)
- Cycle 9: (6, 5, 19, 7, 6)
- Cycle 10: (3, 19, 7, 11, 3)
- Cycle 11: (13, 9, 1, 4, 13)
- Cycle 12: (15, 13, 2, 8, 15)
- Cycle 13: (10, 3, 19, 5, 10)
- Cycle 14: (12, 8, 4, 1, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 has a chord: (7, 5)
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has no chords
- Cycle 4 has no chords
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (8, 18)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (8, 18)
- Cycle 7 has no chords
- Cycle 8 has no chords
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (7, 11)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (8, 2)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (19, 5)
- Cycle 14 has a chord: (4, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

From the above analysis, we can see that there are 4 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final count is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (4, 18), 12>
- <2, (8, 18), 17>
- <10, (7, 11), 3>
- <11, (9, 4), 13>
