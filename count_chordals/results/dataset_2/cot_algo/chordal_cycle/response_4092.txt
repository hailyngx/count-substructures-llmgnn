Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<0, (10, 7), 8>
<0, (19, 11), 3>
<0, (2, 14), 8>
<1, (19, 11), 7>
<1, (2, 14), 7>
<5, (19, 11), 14>
<15, (19, 11), 9>
<16, (19, 11), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final answer is [8].
