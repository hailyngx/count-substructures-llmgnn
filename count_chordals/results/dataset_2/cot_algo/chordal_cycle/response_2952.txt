Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 3, 9, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 5, 4, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 5, 6, 9)
- Cycle 6: (4, 5, 6, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 9, 6, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 3, 9, 4)
- Cycle 9: (6, 5, 4, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 9, 5, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 4, 9, 6)
- Cycle 12: (6, 4, 3, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (5, 6) and (9, 6)
- Cycle 2 has 2 chords: (5, 9) and (4, 9)
- Cycle 3 has 2 chords: (5, 3) and (4, 9)
- Cycle 4 has 0 chords
- Cycle 5 has 0 chords
- Cycle 6 has 0 chords
- Cycle 7 has 2 chords: (4, 6) and (9, 6)
- Cycle 8 has 2 chords: (4, 3) and (9, 3)
- Cycle 9 has 0 chords
- Cycle 10 has 0 chords
- Cycle 11 has 0 chords
- Cycle 12 has 0 chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are a total of 3 chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord, so the final count is [3].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 6), (9, 6)>
- <2, (5, 9), (4, 9)>
- <3, (5, 3), (4, 9)>
