Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (7, 11) (7, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 11, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 10, 8, 11, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 5, 14, 2, 0, 13, 4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 9, 4, 14, 2, 0, 13, 9, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 10, 8, 14, 2, 0, 13, 4, 3)
- Cycle 6: (5, 12, 13, 0, 2, 14, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 7, 11, 8, 14, 0, 13, 12, 5)
- Cycle 8: (1, 6, 12, 13, 0, 2, 14, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 9: (3, 1, 11, 7, 5, 2, 14, 13, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 12, 5, 7, 11, 8, 10, 3, 1)
- Cycle 11: (4, 9, 13, 0, 2, 14, 5, 12, 1)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The cycle <1, 3, 11, 1> has 1 chord: (1, 3)
- The cycle <3, 10, 8, 11, 1> has 1 chord: (10, 11)
- The cycle <1, 3, 5, 14, 2, 0, 13, 4, 1> has 1 chord: (4, 1)
- The cycle <1, 9, 4, 14, 2, 0, 13, 9, 1> has 1 chord: (13, 9)
- The cycle <3, 10, 8, 14, 2, 0, 13, 4, 3> has 1 chord: (3, 10)
- No chord found in the remaining cycles.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordless cycles: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 3, 11, 1>
- <3, 10, 8, 11, 1>
- <1, 3, 5, 14, 2, 0, 13, 4, 1>
- <1, 9, 4, 14, 2, 0, 13, 9, 1>
- <3, 10, 8, 14, 2, 0, 13, 4, 3>
