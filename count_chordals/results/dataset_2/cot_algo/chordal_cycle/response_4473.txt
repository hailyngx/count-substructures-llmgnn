Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- 3-4-9-5-3
- 0-4-9-5-0
- 1-6-5-7-1
- 7-5-9-4-3-7
- 3-4-2-1-6-3
- 3-7-1-2-4-3
- 0-1-2-4-3-0
- 1-7-3-4-9-1
- 1-7-2-4-9-1

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <2, (5, 9), 3>
- <0, (4, 9), 5>
- <6, (5, 7), 1>
- <5, (9, 4), 3, 7>
- <3, (4, 2), 1, 6>
- <2, (3, 7), 4, 1>
- <1, (0, 2), 4, 3>
- <8, (1, 9), 4, 7>
- <9, (1, 2), 4, 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of [9] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
