Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 6) (5, 21) (5, 16) (6, 23) (6, 11) (6, 19) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 20) (4, 23) (4, 27) (4, 25) (18, 9) (18, 25) (18, 13) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 25) (28, 20) (29, 26) (29, 21) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 28) (11, 0) (11, 8) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 17) (14, 22) (14, 0) (27, 4) (27, 24) (27, 2) (1, 10) (15, 26) (15, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 24) (10, 20) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 21) (16, 25) (21, 5) (21, 29) (21, 0) (21, 16) (21, 20) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 0) (17, 0) (26, 29) (26, 15) (2, 27) (2, 10) (20, 22) (20, 12) (20, 28) (20, 10) (20, 21) (19, 6) (19, 24) (24, 27) (24, 10) (24, 19) (13, 18) (13, 9) (25, 4) (25, 18) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 8) (8, 22) (8, 11) (8, 15) (8, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: <22, 23, 6, 11, 22>
        - Cycle 2: <22, 20, 12, 7, 23, 6, 22>
        - Cycle 3: <22, 20, 10, 24, 27, 4, 23, 6, 22>
        - Cycle 4: <22, 14, 0, 11, 28, 16, 5, 21, 0, 14>
        - Cycle 5: <20, 12, 7, 11, 0, 21, 20>
        - Cycle 6: <20, 10, 2, 27, 4, 23, 6, 11, 0, 21, 20>
        - Cycle 7: <20, 28, 16, 5, 21, 0, 14, 22, 20>
        - Cycle 8: <20, 21, 5, 16, 28, 25, 18, 9, 7, 12, 20>
        - Cycle 9: <20, 21, 16, 25, 18, 13, 9, 7, 11, 0, 20>
        - Cycle 10: <20, 21, 0, 11, 7, 12, 20>
        - Cycle 11: <20, 10, 24, 27, 4, 25, 18, 13, 9, 7, 12, 20>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - Chordal 4-cycle <22, 23, 6, 11> with chord (22, 20) inside <>
        - Chordal 4-cycle <22, 20, 12, 7> with chord (22, 14) inside <>
        - Chordal 4-cycle <22, 14, 0, 11> with chord (22, 8) inside <>
        - Chordal 4-cycle <20, 21, 5, 16> with chord (20, 28) inside <>
        - Chordal 4-cycle <20, 10, 24, 27> with chord (20, 21) inside <>
        - Chordal 4-cycle <20, 28, 25, 18> with chord (20, 10) inside <>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        - There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Final count: [5]
