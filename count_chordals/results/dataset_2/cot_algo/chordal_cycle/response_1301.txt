Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-1-14-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-11-14-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-8-12-1-0
- Cycle 4: 1-9-6-12-1
- Cycle 5: 2-7-4-8-3-2
- Cycle 6: 2-1-14-11-2
- Cycle 7: 3-8-4-7-3
- Cycle 8: 4-5-10-1-4
- Cycle 9: 4-7-2-11-4
- Cycle 10: 5-6-9-10-5
- Cycle 11: 12-8-4-0-12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 14)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (11, 2)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (8, 12)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (6, 12)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (1, 11)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (5, 10)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (2, 7)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (0, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 4, 11, 2>
