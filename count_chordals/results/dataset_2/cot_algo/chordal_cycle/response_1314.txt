Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 4) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 6) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

Cycles of length 4:
1. (1, 3, 10, 4, 1)
2. (1, 3, 14, 5, 1)
3. (1, 8, 6, 10, 1)
4. (1, 12, 11, 0, 1)
5. (1, 7, 0, 11, 1)
6. (3, 1, 8, 13, 3)
7. (3, 10, 4, 11, 3)
8. (8, 9, 13, 11, 8)
9. (8, 1, 3, 14, 8)
10. (8, 14, 6, 10, 8)
11. (13, 9, 0, 7, 13)
12. (13, 8, 1, 7, 13)
13. (13, 11, 0, 2, 13)
14. (7, 9, 0, 11, 7)
15. (7, 1, 3, 14, 7)
16. (0, 9, 8, 1, 0)
17. (0, 7, 1, 3, 0)
18. (0, 11, 4, 2, 0)
19. (0, 4, 10, 6, 0)
20. (2, 9, 8, 1, 2)
21. (2, 12, 1, 3, 2)
22. (2, 0, 4, 11, 2)
23. (2, 4, 10, 6, 2)
24. (11, 5, 14, 3, 11)
25. (11, 13, 9, 0, 11)
26. (11, 12, 2, 4, 11)
27. (4, 5, 11, 0, 4)
28. (4, 10, 6, 8, 4)
29. (14, 5, 11, 12, 14)
30. (14, 3, 1, 8, 14)
31. (14, 6, 8, 13, 14)
32. (6, 8, 1, 7, 6)
33. (6, 14, 5, 4, 6)
34. (6, 10, 4, 0, 6)
35. (10, 1, 7, 0, 10)
36. (10, 3, 14, 6, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle:
<1, 3, 10, 4, (11, 12)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 36 chordless cycles in total.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
