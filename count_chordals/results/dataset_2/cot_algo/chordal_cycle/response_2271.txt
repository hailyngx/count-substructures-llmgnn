Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 3, 2, 5, 0>
- <0, 3, 6, 5, 0>
- <1, 6, 5, 7, 1>
- <2, 5, 7, 8, 2>
- <3, 4, 6, 5, 3>
- <4, 6, 7, 5, 4>
- <5, 6, 1, 8, 5>
- <6, 7, 5, 2, 6>
- <7, 8, 2, 9, 7>
- <8, 6, 0, 3, 8>
- <9, 7, 5, 2, 9>

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord (valid chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <3, 4, (6, 5), 3>
- <5, 6, (1, 8), 5>
- <6, 7, (5, 2), 6>
- <7, 8, (2, 9), 7>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [6].
