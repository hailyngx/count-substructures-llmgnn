Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 14) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle <5, 9, 1, 6>
- Cycle <5, 9, 3, 7>
- Cycle <5, 13, 2, 4>
- Cycle <5, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle <9, 3, 7, 13>
- Cycle <9, 1, 6, 5>
- Cycle <1, 6, 5, 4>
- Cycle <3, 7, 13, 2>
- Cycle <6, 1, 0, 2>
- Cycle <6, 1, 9, 3>
- Cycle <6, 4, 2, 13>
- Cycle <6, 4, 5, 9>
- Cycle <3, 12, 14, 6>
- Cycle <7, 3, 12, 6>
- Cycle <2, 13, 7, 3>
- Cycle <2, 13, 5, 4>
- Cycle <2, 0, 1, 6>
- Cycle <2, 0, 11, 8>
- Cycle <2, 4, 5, 9>
- Cycle <2, 4, 10, 14>
- Cycle <7, 14, 6, 4>
- Cycle <7, 14, 11, 8>
- Cycle <7, 0, 1, 6>
- Cycle <7, 0, 2, 13>
- Cycle <7, 0, 11, 8>
- Cycle <11, 8, 7, 3>
- Cycle <11, 8, 7, 14>
- Cycle <14, 11, 8, 7>
- Cycle <14, 11, 6, 4>
- Cycle <14, 12, 3, 7>
- Cycle <12, 3, 7, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <5, 9, 1, 6> with chord (5, 6)
2. <5, 13, 2, 4> with chord (13, 4)
3. <6, 1, 0, 2> with chord (1, 2)
4. <7, 3, 12, 6> with chord (3, 6)
5. <2, 0, 11, 8> with chord (0, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
