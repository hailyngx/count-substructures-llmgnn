Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 1, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 3, 6, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 3, 4, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 0, 4, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 0, 7, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (9, 4, 8, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 7: (9, 7, 0, 5, 9)
        - Cycle 8: (6, 9, 4, 8, 6)
        - Cycle 9: (6, 1, 2, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 10: (4, 0, 2, 1, 4)
        - Cycle 11: (4, 0, 3, 2, 4)
        - Cycle 12: (8, 4, 3, 2, 8)
        - Cycle 13: (8, 3, 0, 7, 8)
        - Cycle 14: (2, 4, 9, 7, 2)
        - Cycle 15: (2, 3, 8, 7, 2)
        - Cycle 16: (0, 4, 9, 5, 0)
        - Cycle 17: (0, 7, 8, 4, 0)
        - Cycle 18: (7, 8, 4, 9, 7)
        - Cycle 19: (7, 0, 5, 9, 7)
        - Cycle 20: (1, 6, 9, 5, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (6, 9), 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (4, 9), 7>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
