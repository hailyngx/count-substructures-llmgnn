Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        <0, 4, 5, 7>
        <0, 4, 8, 1>
        <0, 7, 5, 1>
        <2, 4, 6, 9>
        <2, 4, 8, 1>
        <2, 7, 5, 1>
        <3, 5, 7, 1>
        <3, 5, 4, 0>
        <3, 8, 4, 0>
        <6, 4, 8, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        The cycle <0, 4, 8, 1> has one chord: (4, 8)
        The cycle <2, 4, 8, 1> has one chord: (4, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are 8 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
