Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 5) (13, 19) (13, 14) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 17) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (8, 15) (8, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 17) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 12) (9, 2) (9, 16) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 18) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 4) (16, 9) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 3) (18, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 7, 19) with chord (3, 19)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 8, 11) with chord (3, 11)
- Cycle 3: (3, 18, 12, 0) with chord (3, 12)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 15, 7) with chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 10, 5) with chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 6: (1, 6, 5, 12) with chord (1, 12)
- Cycle 7: (2, 1, 3, 15) with chord (2, 15)
- Cycle 8: (2, 9, 16, 9) with chord (2, 16)
- Cycle 9: (2, 17, 7, 15) with chord (2, 15)
- Cycle 10: (4, 14, 13, 19) with chord (4, 19)
- Cycle 11: (4, 17, 12, 5) with chord (4, 12)
- Cycle 12: (4, 0, 12, 5) with chord (4, 12)
- Cycle 13: (4, 10, 5, 6) with chord (4, 6)

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 3, 15, 7> with chord (1, 7)
- <1, 6, 5, 12> with chord (1, 12)
- <2, 1, 3, 15> with chord (2, 15)
- <2, 9, 16, 9> with chord (2, 16)
- <4, 10, 5, 6> with chord (4, 6)

Step 3:
There are a total of [5] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
