Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 16) (6, 19) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 13) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 5) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 5) (14, 10) (14, 15) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 15) (1, 2) (1, 11) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 16) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 8) (15, 14) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
   - Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
      - Cycle 1: <4, 6, 16, 0>
      - Cycle 2: <4, 6, 19, 5>
      - Cycle 3: <4, 6, 3, 11>
      - Cycle 4: <4, 19, 5, 18>
      - Cycle 5: <4, 19, 6, 16>
      - Cycle 6: <6, 3, 11, 15>
      - Cycle 7: <6, 3, 5, 18>
      - Cycle 8: <6, 19, 5, 12>
      - Cycle 9: <6, 19, 4, 13>
      - Cycle 10: <16, 0, 2, 1>
      - Cycle 11: <16, 0, 5, 18>
      - Cycle 12: <16, 8, 9, 13>
      - Cycle 13: <16, 8, 10, 14>
      - Cycle 14: <5, 18, 2, 17>
      - Cycle 15: <5, 18, 2, 0>
      - Cycle 16: <5, 12, 10, 8>
      - Cycle 17: <5, 12, 11, 3>
      - Cycle 18: <5, 19, 6, 16>
      - Cycle 19: <5, 19, 4, 13>
      - Cycle 20: <5, 19, 4, 6>
      - Cycle 21: <19, 4, 13, 9>
      - Cycle 22: <19, 4, 6, 16>
   
Step 2:
   - Unique chordal 4-cycles:
      - <4, 6, 16, 0>, (4, 16)
      - <4, 19, 5, 18>, (4, 5)
      - <16, 8, 9, 13>, (8, 13)
      - <16, 8, 10, 14>, (8, 14)
      - <5, 12, 10, 8>, (12, 8)
      - <5, 12, 11, 3>, (12, 3)
      - <19, 4, 13, 9>, (4, 9)
      - <19, 4, 6, 16>, (4, 6)
   
Step 3:
   - Total number of chordal 4-cycles = [8]
