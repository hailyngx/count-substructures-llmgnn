Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 19) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 17) (3, 17) (3, 10) (0, 16) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 1) (19, 9) (19, 5) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 4) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 12) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 15) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 13) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (6, 9, 18, 7)
- (6, 9, 7, 2)
- (6, 13, 12, 5)
- (9, 18, 17, 6)
- (9, 18, 7, 0)
- (9, 7, 2, 0)
- (9, 7, 18, 17)
- (8, 10, 3, 17)
- (8, 10, 1, 5)
- (8, 12, 13, 4)
- (13, 16, 0, 2)
- (13, 16, 0, 7)
- (13, 16, 11, 15)
- (13, 6, 9, 18)
- (13, 6, 9, 7)
- (13, 6, 17, 3)
- (13, 12, 8, 10)
- (13, 12, 5, 1)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <6, (9, 18), 7>
- <6, (13, 12), 5>
- <9, (7, 18), 17>
- <8, (10, 3), 17>
- <8, (10, 1), 5>
- <13, (16, 0), 2>
- <13, (16, 11), 15>
- <13, (6, 9), 18>
- <13, (12, 8), 10>

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [9].
