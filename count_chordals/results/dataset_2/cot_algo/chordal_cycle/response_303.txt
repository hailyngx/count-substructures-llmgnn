Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-2-5-4
- Cycle 2: 4-9-6-0-4
- Cycle 3: 3-4-2-0-3
- Cycle 4: 3-9-6-0-3
- Cycle 5: 2-7-1-8-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, (7, 2), 5> with chord 2
- <4, (9, 6), 4> with chord 6
- <3, (4, 2), 0> with chord 2
- <3, (9, 6), 3> with chord 6
- <2, (7, 1), 8> with chord 1

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
