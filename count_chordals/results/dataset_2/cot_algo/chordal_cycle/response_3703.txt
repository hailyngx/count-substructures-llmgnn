Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 13) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 11) (17, 14) (17, 0) (4, 19) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (18, 15) (18, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 16) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 13) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 13) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 5) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 1) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 16) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

- Cycle 1: <3, 15, 18, 6>
- Cycle 2: <3, 15, 13, 4>
- Cycle 3: <3, 15, 18, 6, 7>
- Cycle 4: <3, 15, 13, 12>
- Cycle 5: <3, 14, 11, 5>
- Cycle 6: <3, 14, 17, 0>
- Cycle 7: <3, 14, 11, 5, 0>
- Cycle 8: <3, 14, 17, 0, 7>
- Cycle 9: <3, 14, 11, 5, 0, 1>
- Cycle 10: <15, 18, 6, 7, 10>
- Cycle 11: <15, 18, 6, 12, 13>
- Cycle 12: <15, 13, 19, 4>
- Cycle 13: <15, 13, 12, 6>
- Cycle 14: <15, 18, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 15: <15, 13, 12, 16, 1>
- Cycle 16: <14, 17, 0, 5>
- Cycle 17: <14, 11, 5, 1>
- Cycle 18: <14, 17, 0, 7, 6>
- Cycle 19: <14, 11, 5, 1, 0>
- Cycle 20: <15, 13, 12, 6, 7>
- Extra cycles that are not chordal 4-cycles.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal Cycle 1: <3, 15, 18, 6, (7)>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <3, 15, 13, 4, (19)>
- [2] chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
