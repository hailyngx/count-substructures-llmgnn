Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 5, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 8, 10, 11, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 8, 4, 5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 11, 13, 0, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 5, 6, 12, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 14, 12, 2, 3)
- Cycle 7: (4, 5, 7, 0, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 10, 11, 4)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord <1, 10>
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord <1, 8>
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord <1, 13>
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord <3, 12>
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord <3, 12>
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord <4, 7>
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord <4, 11>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

List of unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, 10, 8, 2>
