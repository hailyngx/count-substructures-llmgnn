Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 5-7-4-9-5
        - Cycle 2: 1-4-7-3-1
        - Cycle 3: 6-1-2-8-6
        - Cycle 4: 0-9-1-2-0

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: 5-7-(4, 9)-5 [Chord: (4,9)]
        - Cycle 2: 1-4-(7, 3)-1 [Chord: (7,3)]
        - Cycle 3: 1-2-(8, 6)-1 [Chord: (8,6)]
        - Cycle 4: 0-9-(1, 2)-0 [Chord: (1,2)]

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0] and the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (4, 9)>
<2, (7, 3)>
<3, (8, 6)>
<4, (1, 2)>
