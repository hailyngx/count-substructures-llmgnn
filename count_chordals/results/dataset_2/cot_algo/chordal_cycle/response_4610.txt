Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 15) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 17) (9, 3) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 7) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 0) (6, 3) (14, 8) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 9, 6>
2. <1, 10, 5, 18>
3. <1, 11, 17, 15>
4. <1, 13, 12, 16>
5. <3, 5, 18, 4>
6. <3, 6, 0, 13>
7. <4, 10, 1, 13>
8. <4, 15, 17, 8>
9. <5, 10, 1, 11>
10. <7, 12, 16, 17>
11. <7, 18, 4, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 11, 17, 15> has chord (1, 15)
- <1, 13, 12, 16> has chord (1, 16)
- <4, 10, 1, 13> has chord (4, 1)
- <5, 10, 1, 11> has chord (5, 1)
- <7, 12, 16, 17> has chord (7, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 6 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<1, 11, 17, 15>
<1, 13, 12, 16>
<4, 10, 1, 13>
<5, 10, 1, 11>
<7, 12, 16, 17>
