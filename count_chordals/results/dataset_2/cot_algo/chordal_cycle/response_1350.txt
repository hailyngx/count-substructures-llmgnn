<(18, 7, 0, 6), (18, 6)>
<(7, 19, 4, 11), (7, 11)>
<(12, 2, 16, 8), (12, 8)>
<(4, 19, 7, 5), (4, 5)>
<(8, 6, 0, 7), (8, 7)>
<(13, 4, 19, 7), (13, 7)>
<(15, 9, 0, 7), (15, 7)>

<(6, 0, 7, 19), (6, 19)>
<(10, 4, 19, 7), (10, 7)>

Step 3:
There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the answer is [16].
