Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 20) (3, 27) (3, 23) (3, 5) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 12) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 11) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 11) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 19) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 11) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 13) (28, 6) (28, 17) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 29) (21, 5) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 16) (29, 9) (29, 22) (29, 24) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 22) (2, 13) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 24) (11, 25) (24, 0) (24, 29) (24, 11) (24, 7) (24, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 16) (20, 26) (20, 19) (27, 3) (27, 7) (23, 3) (23, 12) (25, 15) (25, 11) (5, 3) (5, 21) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 23) (16, 8) (16, 1) (7, 18) (7, 24) (7, 27) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 2) (19, 14) (19, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <9, 26, 20, 19, 14, 0, 8, 9>
- Cycle 2: <9, 26, 20, 19, 14, 1, 4, 18, 10, 17, 28, 6, 9>
- Cycle 3: <9, 1, 4, 18, 13, 15, 8, 9>
- Cycle 4: <9, 1, 16, 8, 15, 13, 18, 4, 11, 6, 9>
- Cycle 5: <26, 20, 19, 14, 0, 2, 10, 17, 28, 6, 9, 26>
- Cycle 6: <26, 20, 19, 14, 0, 8, 15, 13, 18, 4, 1, 9, 26>
- Cycle 7: <3, 27, 7, 24, 11, 4, 1, 9, 8, 15, 12, 23, 3>
- Cycle 8: <15, 8, 0, 2, 10, 17, 28, 6, 11, 25, 15>
- Cycle 9: <15, 8, 0, 14, 19, 20, 26, 9, 1, 4, 11, 25, 15>
- Cycle 10: <15, 8, 0, 14, 19, 20, 26, 9, 29, 22, 2, 10, 17, 28, 6, 11, 25, 15>
- Cycle 11: <15, 13, 18, 4, 1, 9, 26, 20, 19, 14, 0, 8, 16, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (4, 17).
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (1, 15).
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (20, 9).
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (15, 26).
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (27, 2).
- Cycle 8 has no chords.
- Cycle 9 has no chords.
- Cycle 10 has no chords.
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (9, 20).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
