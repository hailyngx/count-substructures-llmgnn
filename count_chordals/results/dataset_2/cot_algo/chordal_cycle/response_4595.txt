Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (10, 13, 5, 8, 2, 13, 5, 10)
- Cycle 2: (12, 9, 1, 4, 0, 12, 4, 1, 9, 12)
- Cycle 3: (6, 7, 10, 13, 2, 6)
- Cycle 4: (3, 8, 2, 14, 0, 3)
- Cycle 5: (12, 9, 0, 14, 2, 13, 10, 12)
- Cycle 6: (6, 0, 14, 12, 6)
- Cycle 7: (3, 8, 5, 1, 4, 3)
- Cycle 8: (5, 7, 10, 13, 5)
- Cycle 9: (10, 13, 0, 4, 12, 10)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle <1, (4, 12), 9> (Cycle 2 with chord 12-4)
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, (0, 14), 12> (Cycle 6 with chord 14-0)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 7 chordless 4-cycles.

Therefore, the final count is [7].
