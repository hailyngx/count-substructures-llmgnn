Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 5, 9, 1)
- (1, 7, 4, 1)
- (1, 3, 4, 1)
- (1, 3, 2, 1)
- (1, 7, 2, 1)
- (2, 1, 5, 2)
- (2, 1, 7, 2)
- (2, 1, 3, 2)
- (2, 5, 9, 2)
- (2, 7, 1, 2)
- (3, 1, 7, 3)
- (3, 1, 4, 3)
- (3, 1, 2, 3)
- (3, 6, 7, 3)
- (3, 4, 7, 3)
- (3, 8, 0, 3)
- (4, 1, 7, 4)
- (4, 1, 3, 4)
- (4, 7, 6, 4)
- (5, 1, 9, 5)
- (5, 1, 7, 5)
- (5, 9, 2, 5)
- (6, 9, 2, 6)
- (6, 7, 4, 6)
- (7, 1, 5, 7)
- (7, 1, 3, 7)
- (7, 1, 2, 7)
- (7, 6, 4, 7)
- (8, 3, 1, 8)
- (8, 0, 7, 8)
- (9, 1, 5, 9)
- (9, 1, 7, 9)
- (9, 5, 2, 9)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The only cycle with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycle) is:
<1, (2, 7), 5>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
