Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (9, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 5, 1, 0)
- Cycle 2: (3, 4, 5, 3)
- Cycle 3: (4, 5, 6, 4)
- Cycle 4: (0, 5, 6, 0)
- Cycle 5: (4, 6, 8, 4)
- Cycle 6: (6, 8, 7, 6)
- Cycle 7: (0, 7, 6, 0)
- Cycle 8: (3, 7, 6, 3)
- Cycle 9: (4, 1, 2, 0, 4)
- Cycle 10: (5, 1, 2, 0, 5)
- Cycle 11: (0, 2, 1, 4, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 9 has one chord (0, 4)
- Cycle 10 has one chord (0, 5)
- Cycle 11 has one chord (0, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the count is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles with chords inside <>:
<1, (0, 4), 2>
<1, (0, 5), 2>
<1, (0, 4), 2>
