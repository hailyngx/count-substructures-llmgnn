Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are multiple cycles in the graph, such as:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-2-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-2-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-2-7-1-0
- Cycle 4: 1-7-2-6-1
- Cycle 5: 1-7-2-4-8-3-0-1
- Cycle 6: 3-8-4-6-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the cycles listed above, cycle 1 (0-5-2-6-0) has exactly one chord, which is (0, 2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Since we found one chordal 4-cycle, the final number is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 2, 6, 5>.
