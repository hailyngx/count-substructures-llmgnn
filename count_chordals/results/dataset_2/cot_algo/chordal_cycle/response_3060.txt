Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles with 4 or more nodes: 

- Cycle 1: 6-9-2-5-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-7-1-6
- Cycle 3: 6-1-5-2-6
- Cycle 4: 6-1-7-9-6
- Cycle 5: 6-8-4-9-6
- Cycle 6: 6-8-7-1-6
- Cycle 7: 6-8-3-0-6
- Cycle 8: 9-4-0-5-9
- Cycle 9: 9-4-2-7-9
- Cycle 10: 9-2-0-3-9
- Cycle 11: 4-5-1-7-4
- Cycle 12: 4-5-2-9-4
- Cycle 13: 4-2-0-3-4
- Cycle 14: 8-7-1-5-8
- Cycle 15: 8-7-9-4-8
- Cycle 16: 0-3-2-1-0

Step 2:
Chordal cycles found: 
- <6, (9, 2), 5, 1>
- <6, (9, 7), 1, 8>
- <6, (1, 5), 2, 6>
- <6, (8, 4), 9, 6>
- <6, (8, 7), 1, 6>
- <6, (8, 3), 0, 6>
- <9, (4, 0), 5, 9>
- <9, (4, 2), 7, 9>
- <9, (2, 0), 3, 9>
- <4, (5, 1), 7, 4>
- <4, (5, 2), 9, 4>
- <4, (2, 0), 3, 4>
- <8, (7, 1), 5, 8>
- <8, (7, 9), 4, 8>
- <0, (3, 2), 1, 0>

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles: [1]
