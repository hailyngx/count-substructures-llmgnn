Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.

Step 2: 
- Since there are no cycles to begin with, there are no cycles to check for chords.

Step 3:
- After steps 1 and 2, we did not find any chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [0].
