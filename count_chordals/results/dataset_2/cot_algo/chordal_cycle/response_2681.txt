- Cycle 30: 13-17-8-16-6-2-21-22-4-7-23-27-15-3-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle <7-4-22-29-15-3> has one chord (4, 15).
- The cycle <3-29-22-4-7-5-13-3> has one chord (4, 7).
- The cycle <3-15-27-23-5-13-3> has one chord (15, 5).
- The cycle <25-14-16-6-13-17-25> has one chord (14, 6).
- The cycle <25-10-12-7-5-23-27-15-25> has one chord (12, 23).
- The cycle <7-4-22-29-24-18-24-1-22-4-7> has one chord (1, 29).
- The cycle <13-5-7-23-27-15-29-22-4-13> has one chord (5, 22).
- The cycle <13-17-11-9-12-7-23-27-15-3-13> has one chord (9, 3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 30 cycles listed, and 8 of them have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [22].
