Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 9) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-12-5-1
- Cycle 3: 2-9-11-12-2
- Cycle 4: 2-6-13-0-2
- Cycle 5: 3-7-9-1-3
- Cycle 6: 3-13-11-8-3
- Cycle 7: 4-13-6-2-4
- Cycle 8: 5-12-4-1-5
- Cycle 9: 7-9-12-11-7
- Cycle 10: 8-3-0-13-8

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, 4, 5, 12> has a chord (4, 12)

Step 3:
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
