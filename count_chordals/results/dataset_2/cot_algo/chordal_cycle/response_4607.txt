Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 22) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 27) (4, 0) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 23) (7, 26) (21, 28) (21, 18) (21, 29) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 27) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 16) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 0) (1, 16) (1, 18) (26, 7) (26, 15) (26, 20) (28, 21) (28, 12) (28, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 20) (11, 9) (11, 23) (11, 15) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 27) (17, 25) (17, 22) (25, 13) (25, 17) (25, 10) (22, 5) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 19) (19, 22) (19, 3) (19, 12) (18, 21) (18, 1) (18, 0) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 15) (24, 16) (24, 3) (15, 26) (15, 11) (15, 16) (3, 19) (3, 2) (3, 24) (20, 26) (20, 14) (20, 12) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 20) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 25) (10, 2) (27, 9) (27, 8) (27, 23) (29, 4) (29, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (5, 6, 8, 13, 16, 1, 18, 21, 28, 10, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 22, 17, 25, 13, 8, 6, 10, 28, 21, 18, 0, 4, 2, 3, 19, 22)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 9, 11, 15, 26, 20, 14, 22)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 9, 27, 23, 7, 26, 20, 12, 28, 21, 29, 4, 0, 14, 20)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 9, 11, 15, 26, 7, 23, 27, 8, 6, 0, 4, 29, 21, 18, 1, 16)
        - Cycle 6: (8, 6, 0, 4, 29, 21, 28, 12, 19, 22, 14, 20, 26, 15, 11, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 7: (8, 6, 0, 4, 29, 21, 18, 1, 16, 13, 25, 17, 22, 14, 20, 26, 7)
        - Cycle 8: (8, 6, 10, 28, 12, 19, 3, 2, 4, 0, 18, 21, 29, 14, 22, 17, 25)
        - Cycle 9: (13, 8, 6, 0, 18, 21, 28, 12, 19, 3, 24, 16, 1, 18)
        - Cycle 10: (13, 8, 6, 5, 9, 11, 15, 26, 20, 14, 22, 19, 3, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        In the given cycles, the following cycle has exactly one chord: 
        - <5, (9, 27), 23, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        As we found one unique chordal 4-cycle, the count is [1].
