Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (16, 1) (16, 18) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 17) (8, 2) (8, 17) (4, 0) (4, 17) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 10) (1, 16) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (17, 2) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 2) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 9) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 10) (9, 19) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 0, 4, 17, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 0, 7, 5, 18, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 0, 7, 15, 2, 17, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 16, 18, 10, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 16, 18, 5, 7, 15, 19, 2, 17, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 13, 11, 15, 7, 0, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (1, 0), 4, 17, 1>
- <1, (1, 0), 7, 5, 18, 1>
- <1, (1, 0), 7, (7, 15), 2, 17, 1>
- <1, (1, 16), 18, 10, 1>
- <1, (1, 16), 18, 5, 7, (7, 15), 19, 2, 17, 1>
- <1, 13, 11, (11, 15), 7, 0, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
