Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 16) (13, 7) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 15) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 15) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 1) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 15) (14, 4) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 11) (9, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (2, 18, 4, 19) with edges (2, 18), (18, 4), (4, 19), (19, 2)
- Cycle 2: (5, 18, 4, 14) with edges (5, 18), (18, 4), (4, 14), (14, 5)
- Cycle 3: (7, 13, 16, 1) with edges (7, 13), (13, 16), (16, 1), (1, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord between vertices 2 and 4: <1, (2, 4), 3, 5>
- Cycle 2 has a chord between vertices 5 and 14: <2, (5, 14), 4, 18>
- Cycle 3 has a chord between vertices 7 and 16: <3, (7, 16), 13, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
- There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (2, 4), 3, 5>
<2, (5, 14), 4, 18>
<3, (7, 16), 13, 1>
