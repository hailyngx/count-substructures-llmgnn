Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 0) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (12, 10) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
The graph described has the following unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord:

<1, (2, 14), 9>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
