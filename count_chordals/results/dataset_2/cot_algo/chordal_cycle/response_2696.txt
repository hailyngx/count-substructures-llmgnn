Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-7-4-5 with corresponding edges (5, 9), (9, 7), (7, 4), (4, 5).
- Cycle 2: 5-1-3-4-5 with corresponding edges (5, 1), (1, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5).
- Cycle 3: 5-6-1-2-5 with corresponding edges (5, 6), (6, 1), (1, 2), (2, 5).
- Cycle 4: 5-8-2-3-5 with corresponding edges (5, 8), (8, 2), (2, 3), (3, 5).
- Cycle 5: 9-5-1-6-9 with corresponding edges (9, 5), (5, 1), (1, 6), (6, 9).
- Cycle 6: 9-3-1-2-9 with corresponding edges (9, 3), (3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 9).
- Cycle 7: 4-7-9-3-4 with corresponding edges (4, 7), (7, 9), (9, 3), (3, 4).
- Cycle 8: 7-4-0-5-7 with corresponding edges (7, 4), (4, 0), (0, 5), (5, 7).
- Cycle 9: 1-6-9-7-1 with corresponding edges (1, 6), (6, 9), (9, 7), (7, 1).
- Cycle 10: 3-2-5-8-3 with corresponding edges (3, 2), (2, 5), (5, 8), (8, 3).
- Cycle 11: 6-0-4-7-6 with corresponding edges (6, 0), (0, 4), (4, 7), (7, 6).

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 9 connecting non-adjacent nodes.
- Cycle 2 has a chord 1 connecting non-adjacent nodes.
- Cycle 3 has a chord 6 connecting non-adjacent nodes.
- Cycle 4 has a chord 8 connecting non-adjacent nodes.
- Cycle 5 has a chord 6 connecting non-adjacent nodes.
- Cycle 6 has a chord 3 connecting non-adjacent nodes.
- Cycle 8 has a chord 4 connecting non-adjacent nodes.
- Cycle 9 has a chord 6 connecting non-adjacent nodes.
- Cycle 10 has a chord 5 connecting non-adjacent nodes.
- Cycle 11 has a chord 0 connecting non-adjacent nodes.

Finally, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <5-9-7-4-5> with one chord (9). 

So, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].
