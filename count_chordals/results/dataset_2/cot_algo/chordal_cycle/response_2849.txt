Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 5, 13, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 13, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 11, 6, 13, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 3, 7, 8, 14, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 12, 10, 3, 2, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 6, 11, 14, 8, 7, 3, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 7, 6, 10, 12, 1, 2, 3>
- Cycle 8: <5, 7, 6, 10, 13, 5>
- Cycle 9: <9, 0, 4, 5, 13, 9>
- Cycle 10: <11, 0, 4, 5, 13, 9, 11>
- Cycle 11: <11, 0, 14, 1, 12, 10, 6, 11>
- Cycle 12: <12, 1, 3, 7, 6, 11, 14, 12>
- Cycle 13: <13, 5, 7, 8, 14, 11, 6, 13>
- Cycle 14: <14, 1, 3, 7, 8, 14>

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 4, 5, 13, 0> (Chord: (4, 13))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 9, 13, 5, 4, 0> (Chord: (9, 5))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 3, 7, 8, 14, 1> (Chord: (3, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 12, 10, 3, 2, 1> (Chord: (12, 2))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 6, 11, 14, 8, 7, 3, 2> (Chord: (6, 14))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <3, 7, 6, 10, 12, 1, 2, 3> (Chord: (7, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, 7, 6, 10, 13, 5> (Chord: (7, 13))
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <14, 1, 3, 7, 8, 14> (Chord: (1, 7))

Step 3:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles = [8]
