Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1: 8 - 13 - 7 - 3 - 8
2. Cycle 2: 10 - 11 - 1 - 6 - 10
3. Cycle 3: 4 - 12 - 7 - 13 - 4
4. Cycle 4: 9 - 10 - 2 - 11 - 9
5. Cycle 5: 1 - 12 - 0 - 6 - 1
6. Cycle 6: 5 - 0 - 12 - 4 - 5
7. Cycle 7: 3 - 6 - 0 - 5 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Cycle 1 has a chord between 13 and 3 - <1, (13, 3), 1>
2. Cycle 2 has a chord between 11 and 6 - <2, (11, 6), 10>
3. Cycle 3 has a chord between 12 and 7 - <3, (12, 7), 4>
4. Cycle 4 has a chord between 10 and 11 - <4, (10, 11), 2>
5. Cycle 5 has a chord between 12 and 1 - <5, (12, 1), 6>
6. Cycle 6 has a chord between 12 and 4 - <6, (12, 4), 7>
7. Cycle 7 has a chord between 6 and 0 - <7, (6, 0), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, all cycles have chords, so the number of chordless 4-cycles is [0].
