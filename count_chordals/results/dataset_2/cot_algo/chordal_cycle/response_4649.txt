Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 9) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 2) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 3) (0, 14) (0, 17) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 12) (1, 4) (1, 19) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (19, 5) (19, 1) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 3) (7, 17) (7, 2) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 12) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles with 4 or more nodes in the given graph are:
1. Cycle 0-17-16-4-1-19-5
2. Cycle 9-11-4-6
3. Cycle 9-11-2-12
4. Cycle 9-10-16-17
5. Cycle 10-16-4-6

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the cycle 9-11-4-6 has exactly one chord (9-6).

Step 3:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle in the given graph, which is <9, 11, (9, 6), 4, 6> with one chord 9-6.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].
