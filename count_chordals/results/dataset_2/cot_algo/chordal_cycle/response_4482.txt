Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 16, 12, 4>: Chord (16, 4)
- <0, 11, 26, 4>: Chord (11, 26)
- <0, 19, 26, 1>: Chord (19, 1)
- <1, 27, 16, 12>: Chord (27, 12)
- <4, 12, 16, 0>: Chord (12, 0)
- <4, 17, 27, 22>: Chord (17, 22)
- <5, 16, 12, 4>: Chord (16, 12)
- <9, 19, 26, 4>: Chord (19, 4)
- <16, 5, 15, 3>: Chord (5, 15)
- <23, 11, 0, 16>: Chord (11, 16)
- <25, 2, 10, 22>: Chord (2, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
