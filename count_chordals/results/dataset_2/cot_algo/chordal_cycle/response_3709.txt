Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 8) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 16) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (19, 1) (19, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (16, 17) (16, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 14) (6, 0) (6, 18) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 16) (2, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 2) (18, 6)

- Cycle 3: (5, 12, 0, 6)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 15, 13)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 10, 0)
- Cycle 6: (9, 4, 15, 13)
- Cycle 7: (9, 10, 0, 6)
- Cycle 8: (9, 2, 14, 8)
- Cycle 9: (1, 3, 8, 10)

- Cycle 16: (0, 10, 9, 4)
- Cycle 17: (0, 6, 18, 6)
- Cycle 18: (7, 19, 1, 3)
- Cycle 19: (7, 15, 4, 5)
- Cycle 20: (19, 1, 3, 8)
- Cycle 21: (19, 7, 15, 4)
- Cycle 22: (4, 15, 7, 0)
- Cycle 23: (12, 5, 14, 2)
- Cycle 24: (12, 0, 6, 18)
- Cycle 25: (12, 10, 0, 7)
- Cycle 26: (10, 9, 2, 14)
- Cycle 27: (10, 0, 7, 15)
- Cycle 28: (10, 8, 14, 2)
- Cycle 29: (14, 5, 9, 2)
- Cycle 30: (14, 2, 16, 17)
- Cycle 31: (16, 17, 3, 1)
- Cycle 32: (16, 2, 9, 4)
- Cycle 33: (8, 3, 1, 17)
- Cycle 34: (8, 10, 9, 2)
- Cycle 35: (8, 14, 5, 12)
- Cycle 36: (6, 0, 10, 9)
- Cycle 37: (6, 18, 6, 0)
- Cycle 38: (15, 7, 19, 1)
- Cycle 39: (15, 4, 9, 2)
- Cycle 40: (15, 13, 10, 8)
- Cycle 41: (2, 9, 10, 0)
- Cycle 42: (2, 14, 5, 12)
- Cycle 43: (2, 16, 17, 3)
- Cycle 44: (2, 13, 15, 7)
- Cycle 45: (13, 9, 4, 15)
- Cycle 46: (13, 10, 8, 3)
- Cycle 47: (13, 15, 7, 19)
- Cycle 48: (18, 6, 0, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 8), 10)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <10, (9, 2), 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <14, (2, 16), 17)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <16, (17, 3), 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <8, (3, 1), 17)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <15, (7, 19), 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, (15, 7), 19)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <12, (0, 6), 18)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 40 chordless cycles in total.

Therefore, the final result is [40].
