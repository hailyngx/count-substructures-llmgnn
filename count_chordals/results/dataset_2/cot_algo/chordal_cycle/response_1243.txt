Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (9, 4), 0, (8, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (9, 10), 2, (8, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (9, 10), 3, (8, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (9, 10), 12, (8, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (7, 8), 2, (1, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (7, 8), 3, (1, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, (7, 8), 12, (1, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, (7, 6), 0, (1, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <3, (2, 10), 9, (8, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <3, (2, 10), 14, (8, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <4, (0, 8), 7, (4, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <5, (4, 9), 10, (5, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <10, (9, 1), 7, (10, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <10, (9, 4), 6, (10, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <13, (0, 8), 7, (13, 4)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found: [15]

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [15].
