Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 3, 1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 3, 2, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 8, 6, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 8, 7, 5)
- Cycle 6: (9, 3, 4, 8, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 4, 0, 5, 9)
- Cycle 8: (1, 3, 2, 1)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 2, 4)
- Cycle 10: (6, 8, 2, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 8, 7, 6)
- Cycle 12: (2, 8, 7, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 1).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (4, 3).
- Cycle 4 has a chord (4, 8).
- Cycle 5 has a chord (6, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are <(5, 4, 3, 1, 5)>, <(5, 4, 3, 2, 5)>, <(5, 4, 8, 6, 5)>, <(5, 6, 8, 7, 5)>.
