Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 11) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 9) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (15, 17) (15, 8) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 2) (7, 18) (7, 10) (7, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 13) (9, 0) (9, 4) (6, 17) (6, 18) (19, 2) (19, 10) (5, 11) (5, 7) (8, 1) (8, 15) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 19) (2, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (0, 16, 3, 18, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 9, 0, 12, 16, 3, 11, 17, 6, 18, 7, 5, 11, 3, 18, 4, 13, 12, 0, 9, 4, 18, 6, 17, 11, 3, 16, 12, 13, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 3, 16, 12, 13, 10, 19, 2)
- Cycle 4: (4, 13, 2, 19, 10, 7, 5, 11, 17, 15, 8, 1)
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 18, 6, 17, 11, 3, 16, 2, 13, 10)
- Cycle 6: (8, 1, 4, 13, 10, 19, 2, 16, 3, 11, 17, 15, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (3, 16), 4>
- <2, (13, 10), 19>
- <4, (13, 2), 10>
- <5, (7, 18), 6>
- <8, (1, 4), 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are [5] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
