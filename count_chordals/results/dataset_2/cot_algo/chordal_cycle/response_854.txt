Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle: 0-4-1-7-0
2. Cycle: 1-4-3-5-1
3. Cycle: 2-5-8-2
4. Cycle: 3-4-0-9-3
5. Cycle: 4-5-3-4
6. Cycle: 5-2-8-5
7. Cycle: 6-7-8-6
8. Cycle: 7-1-2-7
9. Cycle: 8-5-2-8
10. Cycle: 9-3-7-9

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle: 1-4-3-5-1 has one chord <2, 7>
- Cycle: 2-5-8-2 has one chord <6, 7>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 4, 1, 7, (0, 7)>
<3, 4, 0, 9, (3, 9)>
<4, 5, 3, 4, (3, 5)>
<5, 2, 8, 5, (2, 8)>
<6, 7, 8, 6, (6, 7)>
<7, 1, 2, 7, (1, 2)>
<8, 5, 2, 8, (2, 5)>
<9, 3, 7, 9, (3, 7)>
