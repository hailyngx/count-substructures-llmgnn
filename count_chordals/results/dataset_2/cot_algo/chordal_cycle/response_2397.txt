Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 13) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 10 - 2 - 12 - 4 - 10 (chords: 2-4)
- Cycle 2: 10 - 6 - 14 - 4 - 10 (chords: 6-14)
- Cycle 3: 11 - 8 - 9 - 1 - 11 (chords: 8-9)
- Cycle 4: 11 - 5 - 0 - 3 - 11 (chords: 5-0)
- Cycle 5: 12 - 13 - 11 - 8 - 12 (chords: 13-8)

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (2, 4), 10>
- <2, (6, 14), 10>
- <3, (8, 9), 11>
- <4, (5, 0), 11>
- <5, (13, 8), 12>

Step 3:
The number of chordless chordal 4-cycles is [0].
