Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 25) (15, 4) (15, 2) (27, 1) (3, 26) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 21) (20, 25) (20, 4) (20, 19) (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 24) (18, 0) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 5) (12, 5) (10, 17) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (9, 18) (9, 22) (24, 18) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 2) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 8) (26, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (28, 8) (28, 1) (23, 2) (23, 29) (1, 27) (1, 28) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 13) (6, 18) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 19) (8, 26) (8, 28) (7, 24) (7, 26) (7, 29) (7, 2) (29, 23) (29, 7) (29, 0) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 29) (14, 10) (14, 6) (2, 15) (2, 24) (2, 26) (2, 23) (2, 7) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 1) (21, 25) (21, 4) (21, 5) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 19) (5, 22) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 4) (4, 15) (4, 20) (4, 24) (4, 21) (4, 5) (19, 20) (19, 6) (19, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
- (15, 25, 20, 4)
- (15, 25, 21, 5)
- (25, 20, 4, 24)
- (25, 20, 19, 6)
- (18, 22, 5, 12)
- (10, 17, 16, 1)
- (18, 22, 9, 18)
- (24, 7, 29, 0)
- (26, 8, 28, 1)
- (0, 18, 22, 9)
- (6, 18, 24, 7)
- (16, 10, 14, 6)
- (19, 6, 18, 24)
- (21, 5, 22, 18)
- (13, 11, 0, 18)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (6, 16), 14>
- <5, (15, 25), 21>
- <4, (20, 24), 5>
- <18, (9, 22), 5>
- <22, (5, 12), 18>
- <20, (19, 6), 18>
- <24, (7, 29), 0>
- <26, (8, 28), 1>
- <0, (11, 13), 18>
- <18, (6, 24), 7>
- <6, (14, 10), 16>
- <18, (24, 4), 2>
- <18, (18, 22), 9>
- <21, (5, 22), 18>
- <0, (18, 22), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are [15] chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
