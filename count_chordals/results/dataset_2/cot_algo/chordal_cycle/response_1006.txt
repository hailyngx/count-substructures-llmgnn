Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 8) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 15) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 27) (0, 8) (0, 13) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 3) (27, 20) (17, 22) (17, 29) (29, 27) (29, 17) (29, 5) (29, 21) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 12) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 11) (26, 16) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 10) (21, 29) (21, 3) (14, 9) (14, 22) (14, 26) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 23) (1, 8) (2, 12) (2, 20) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 25) (18, 9) (18, 15) (15, 22) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 28) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 16) (11, 19) (11, 26) (11, 15) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (24, 4) (24, 7) (24, 12) (16, 26) (16, 25) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 20) (20, 27) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 5) (28, 15) (28, 5) (5, 29) (5, 20) (5, 28)

   - Cycle 1: <1, 4, 7, 24, 12>
   - Cycle 2: <3, 27, 23, 25, 16>
   - Cycle 3: <5, 20, 27, 23, 22>
   - Cycle 4: <8, 0, 13, 10, 3>
   - Cycle 5: <9, 18, 15, 22, 17>
   - Cycle 6: <11, 19, 26, 14, 22>
   - Cycle 7: <11, 19, 26, 16, 25>
   - Cycle 8: <12, 2, 20, 27, 23>
   - Cycle 9: <14, 9, 18, 15, 28>
   - Cycle 10: <14, 9, 18, 22, 17>
   - Cycle 11: <15, 22, 23, 27, 20>
   - Cycle 12: <16, 26, 19, 11, 15>
   - Cycle 13: <16, 26, 14, 9, 18>
   - Cycle 14: <20, 27, 23, 22, 17>
   - Cycle 15: <20, 27, 23, 25, 16>
   - Cycle 16: <22, 23, 27, 29, 5>
   - Cycle 17: <22, 17, 29, 5, 28>
   - Cycle 18: <24, 7, 4, 1, 8>
   - Cycle 19: <25, 23, 27, 20, 8>
   - Cycle 20: <26, 19, 11, 15, 28>
   - Cycle 21: <26, 19, 11, 15, 22>
   - Cycle 22: <27, 23, 22, 14, 9>
   - Cycle 23: <29, 27, 23, 22, 15>
   - Cycle 24: <29, 17, 22, 14, 26>
   - Cycle 25: <29, 17, 22, 15, 11>
   - Cycle 26: <29, 5, 20, 27, 23>
   - Cycle 27: <29, 5, 28, 15, 11>
   
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (7, 24), 12>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (27, 23), 16>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <5, (20, 27), 23>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <8, (0, 13), 3>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <9, (18, 15), 22>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <11, (19, 26), 15>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <14, (9, 18), 22>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <15, (22, 23), 27>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <16, (26, 19), 11>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <20, (27, 23), 25>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <22, (23, 27), 29>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <24, (7, 4), 1>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <26, (19, 11), 15>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <27, (23, 22), 14>
   - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <29, (17, 22), 15>
   
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [13].
