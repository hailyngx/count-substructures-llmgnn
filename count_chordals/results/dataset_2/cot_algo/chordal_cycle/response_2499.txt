Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (3, 4) (3, 0) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more:

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 7-4-5-9-7
- Cycle 2: 4-1-0-7-4
- Cycle 3: 4-3-0-7-4
- Cycle 4: 9-5-4-7-9
- Cycle 5: 9-11-7-4-9
- Cycle 6: 9-14-0-7-9
- Cycle 7: 11-7-0-3-11
- Cycle 8: 11-2-7-4-11
- Cycle 9: 14-9-11-7-14
- Cycle 10: 14-0-3-4-14
- Cycle 11: 0-7-11-9-0
- Cycle 12: 0-12-14-9-0
- Cycle 13: 1-6-9-14-1
- Cycle 14: 1-0-7-11-1
- Cycle 15: 1-4-7-11-1
- Cycle 16: 1-13-14-9-1
- Cycle 17: 2-7-11-9-2
- Cycle 18: 2-13-14-9-2
- Cycle 19: 3-4-7-0-3
- Cycle 20: 8-9-11-7-8
- Cycle 21: 8-7-0-14-8
- Cycle 22: 8-10-1-4-8
- Cycle 23: 10-8-9-14-10
- Cycle 24: 10-1-0-14-10
- Cycle 25: 10-12-0-14-10
- Cycle 26: 12-0-7-11-12
- Cycle 27: 12-1-4-7-12
- Cycle 28: 12-13-14-9-12
- Cycle 29: 13-14-9-11-13
- Cycle 30: 13-2-7-11-13

Next, let's identify the unique chordal 4-cycle:
<9, (4, 14), 7)>
<1, (0, 11), 4)>
<4, (3, 7), 1)>
<10, (8, 14), 1)>

Finally, counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have a total of [30] chordless cycles.
