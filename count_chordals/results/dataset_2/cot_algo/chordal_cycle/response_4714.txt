Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 9, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 9, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 4, 9, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 6, 0, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 6, 0, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 9: (2, 4, 5, 3, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 4, 9, 7, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 3, 7, 0, 6, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 3, 7, 9, 5, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 7, 9, 5, 4, 2)
- Cycle 14: (2, 7, 9, 0, 6, 2)
- Cycle 15: (2, 8, 7, 9, 5, 2)
- Cycle 16: (2, 8, 7, 0, 6, 2)
- Cycle 17: (3, 5, 4, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 18: (3, 7, 9, 6, 0, 3)
- Cycle 19: (4, 5, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 20: (4, 5, 1, 6, 0, 4)
- Cycle 21: (4, 5, 3, 7, 2, 4)
- Cycle 22: (5, 4, 9, 7, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has one chord: <1, 6>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: <2, 3>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: <0, 7>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: <7, 2>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: <6, 0>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: <5, 3>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: <9, 0>
- Cycle 8 has one chord: <3, 7>
- Cycle 9 has one chord: <5, 3>
- Cycle 10 has one chord: <7, 9>
- Cycle 11 has one chord: <0, 6>
- Cycle 12 has one chord: <7, 9>
- Cycle 13 has one chord: <5, 4>
- Cycle 14 has one chord: <9, 0>
- Cycle 15 has one chord: <5, 4>
- Cycle 16 has one chord: <9, 0>
- Cycle 17 has one chord: <4, 9>
- Cycle 18 has one chord: <9, 6>
- Cycle 19 has one chord: <7, 9>
- Cycle 20 has one chord: <1, 6>
- Cycle 21 has one chord: <3, 7>
- Cycle 22 has one chord: <4, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 22 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [22].
