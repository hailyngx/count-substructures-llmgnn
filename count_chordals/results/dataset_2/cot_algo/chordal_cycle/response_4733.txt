Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 14) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (3, 1, 11, 9)
        - Cycle 2: (3, 1, 14, 13)
        - Cycle 3: (3, 1, 11, 10)
        - Cycle 4: (3, 1, 14, 7)
        - Cycle 5: (3, 1, 14, 12)
        - Cycle 6: (3, 13, 8, 10)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 13, 8, 12)
        - Cycle 8: (3, 4, 7, 13)
        - Cycle 9: (6, 3, 1, 11)
        - Cycle 10: (6, 3, 1, 14)
        - Cycle 11: (6, 3, 1, 14)
        - Cycle 12: (6, 3, 13, 8)
        - Cycle 13: (6, 3, 13, 14)
        - Cycle 14: (6, 3, 13, 7)
        - Cycle 15: (6, 7, 9, 11)
        - Cycle 16: (6, 7, 9, 2)
        - Cycle 17: (6, 7, 14, 13)
        - Cycle 18: (6, 13, 3, 1)
        - Cycle 19: (6, 13, 3, 4)
        - Cycle 20: (6, 13, 8, 10)
        - Cycle 21: (6, 13, 8, 12)
        - Cycle 22: (6, 13, 14, 7)
        - Cycle 23: (7, 14, 13, 6)
        - Cycle 24: (7, 14, 13, 8)
        - Cycle 25: (8, 10, 11, 9)
        - Cycle 26: (8, 10, 12, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Cycle 2: (3, 1, 14, 13) has chord (3, 14)
        - Cycle 6: (3, 13, 8, 10) has chord (13, 8)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 13, 8, 12) has chord (13, 8)
        - Cycle 8: (3, 4, 7, 13) has chord (4, 7)
        - Cycle 15: (6, 7, 9, 11) has chord (7, 9)
        - Cycle 16: (6, 7, 9, 2) has chord (7, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 20 chordless 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [20].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <3, 1, 11, 9>
        <3, 1, 14, 13>
        <3, 13, 8, 10>
        <3, 13, 8, 12>
        <3, 4, 7, 13>
        <6, 7, 9, 11>
        <6, 7, 9, 2>
