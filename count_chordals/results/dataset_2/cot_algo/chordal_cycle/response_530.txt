Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, we cannot have any chordal 4-cycles.

Step 3:
- As there are no chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [0].
