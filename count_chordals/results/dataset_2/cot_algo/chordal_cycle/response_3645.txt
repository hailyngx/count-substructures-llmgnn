Following the steps provided above to find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more where every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: Cycle with vertices (3, 11, 5, 17)
- Cycle 2: Cycle with vertices (3, 11, 0, 1)
- Cycle 3: Cycle with vertices (3, 11, 6, 4)
- Cycle 4: Cycle with vertices (3, 14, 8, 1)
- Cycle 5: Cycle with vertices (15, 9, 16, 7)
- Cycle 6: Cycle with vertices (15, 9, 11, 5)
- Cycle 7: Cycle with vertices (15, 13, 18, 2)
- Cycle 8: Cycle with vertices (10, 17, 5, 11)
- Cycle 9: Cycle with vertices (10, 17, 0, 3)
- Cycle 10: Cycle with vertices (10, 17, 6, 4)
- Cycle 11: Cycle with vertices (17, 0, 1, 8)
- Cycle 12: Cycle with vertices (17, 6, 4, 12)
- Cycle 13: Cycle with vertices (4, 12, 1, 0)
- Cycle 14: Cycle with vertices (4, 12, 16, 7)
- Cycle 15: Cycle with vertices (4, 19, 13, 18)
- Cycle 16: Cycle with vertices (8, 10, 6, 4)
- Cycle 17: Cycle with vertices (8, 10, 17, 0)
- Cycle 18: Cycle with vertices (8, 2, 15, 9)
- Cycle 19: Cycle with vertices (8, 14, 3, 11)
- Cycle 20: Cycle with vertices (7, 12, 1, 0)
- Cycle 21: Cycle with vertices (7, 12, 16, 9)
- Cycle 22: Cycle with vertices (12, 4, 6, 10)
- Cycle 23: Cycle with vertices (12, 7, 16, 9)
- Cycle 24: Cycle with vertices (12, 16, 9, 15)
- Cycle 25: Cycle with vertices (18, 13, 19, 4)
- Cycle 26: Cycle with vertices (2, 15, 9, 11)
- Cycle 27: Cycle with vertices (2, 8, 14, 3)
- Cycle 28: Cycle with vertices (5, 17, 10, 6)
- Cycle 29: Cycle with vertices (5, 11, 3, 14)
- Cycle 30: Cycle with vertices (13, 15, 9, 16)
- Cycle 31: Cycle with vertices (13, 19, 4, 12)
- Cycle 32: Cycle with vertices (11, 3, 14, 8)
- Cycle 33: Cycle with vertices (11, 5, 17, 10)
- Cycle 34: Cycle with vertices (11, 0, 1, 8)
- Cycle 35: Cycle with vertices (11, 9, 16, 7)
- Cycle 36: Cycle with vertices (16, 7, 12, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, 11, 0, 1>: Chord (0, 1)
- <15, 9, 11, 5>: Chord (9, 5)
- <10, 17, 6, 4>: Chord (17, 4)
- <4, 12, 1, 0>: Chord (1, 0)
- <8, 10, 6, 4>: Chord (10, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
