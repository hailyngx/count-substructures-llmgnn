Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 29) (15, 24) (27, 24) (27, 2) (27, 17) (27, 1) (6, 28) (6, 3) (6, 16) (9, 25) (9, 28) (9, 20) (5, 19) (5, 17) (17, 27) (17, 5) (17, 29) (17, 21) (29, 15) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 11) (7, 20) (7, 2) (12, 16) (12, 11) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 22) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 24) (13, 15) (13, 24) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 8) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 18) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 21) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 23) (21, 17) (21, 18) (21, 10) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 23) (16, 20) (3, 6) (3, 28) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 22) (25, 2) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 1) (20, 9) (20, 7) (20, 16) (23, 10) (23, 16) (1, 27) (1, 25) (1, 22) (1, 4) (24, 15) (24, 27) (24, 28) (24, 13) (8, 15) (8, 26) (8, 10) (11, 29) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 1) (2, 27) (2, 7) (2, 25) (2, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
    - There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: <15, 29, 17, 27>
        - Cycle 2: <6, 16, 12, 11>
        - Cycle 3: <9, 20, 16, 6>
        - Cycle 4: <5, 19, 18, 26>
        - Cycle 5: <17, 29, 19, 18>
        - Cycle 6: <27, 2, 25, 1>
        - Cycle 7: <28, 24, 27, 17>
        - Cycle 8: <15, 24, 27, 17>
        - Cycle 9: <15, 13, 24, 27>
        - Cycle 10: <7, 2, 25, 1>
        - Cycle 11: <22, 25, 1, 27>
        - Cycle 12: <20, 16, 23, 10>
        - Cycle 13: <14, 22, 25, 1>
        - Cycle 14: <14, 0, 22, 25>
        - Cycle 15: <0, 14, 22, 1>
        - Cycle 16: <26, 28, 24, 13>

Step 2: 
    - Out of the cycles listed above, the cycle <15, 29, 17, 27> has exactly one chord: (15, 17).

Step 3:
    - The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0]. 
    - The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <15, 29, 17, 27> with the chord (15, 17).
