Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 4) (7, 5) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 0) (14, 11) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 8, 1, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 9, 4, 11, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 9, 7, 1, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 6, 9, 7, 5, 3, 8, 1, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 6, 9, 7, 10, 11, 2, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 6, 13, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 6, 13, 2, 4, 9, 7, 5, 3, 8, 1, 0)
- Cycle 8: (0, 11, 2, 13, 9, 7, 1, 5, 12, 10, 0)
- Cycle 9: (0, 11, 4, 7, 1, 5, 12, 10, 9, 6, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (8, 1)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 11)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (7, 1)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (7, 5)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (10, 11)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (13, 9)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (2, 13)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (6, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [9].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 6, 9, 7, 1>
<0, 6, 9, 4, 11>
<0, 6, 13, 2, 3>
<0, 11, 4, 7, 1>
<0, 6, 9, 7, 5, 3, 8, 1>
<0, 6, 9, 7, 10, 11, 2>
<0, 6, 13, 2, 4, 9, 7, 5>
<0, 11, 4, 7, 1, 5, 12, 10>
<0, 11, 2, 13, 9, 7, 1, 5, 12, 10>
