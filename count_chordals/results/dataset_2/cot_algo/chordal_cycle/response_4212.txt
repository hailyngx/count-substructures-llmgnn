Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 10) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 19) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 6) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 8) (5, 17) (5, 12) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 17) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 1, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 3, 15, 13, 11)
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 19, 17, 6)
- Cycle 4: (10, 17, 1, 16, 10)
- Cycle 5: (6, 7, 17, 1, 6)
- Cycle 6: (12, 14, 4, 18, 12)
- Cycle 7: (8, 6, 13, 15, 8)

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:

- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (16, 1)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (15, 13)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (9, 17)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (17, 16)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (7, 1)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (14, 4)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (6, 15)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, which results in [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<11, 16, 1, 11> with chord (16, 1)
<11, 3, 15, 13, 11> with chord (15, 13)
<6, 9, 19, 17, 6> with chord (9, 17)
<10, 17, 1, 16, 10> with chord (17, 16)
<6, 7, 17, 1, 6> with chord (7, 1)
<12, 14, 4, 18, 12> with chord (14, 4)
<8, 6, 13, 15, 8> with chord (6, 15)
