Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 8 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 8 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 9 - 6 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 9 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 5: 5 - 9 - 7 - 0 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 6: 5 - 9 - 7 - 0 - 1 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 7: 5 - 9 - 7 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 8: 5 - 9 - 7 - 3 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 9: 5 - 9 - 7 - 3 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 10: 5 - 9 - 6 - 3 - 7 - 5

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <5, (8, 2), 9>.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [9].
