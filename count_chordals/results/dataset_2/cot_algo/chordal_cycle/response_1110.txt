Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - <1, 3, 9, 0> (cycle of length 4)
        - <1, 3, 9, 4> (cycle of length 4)
        - <1, 3, 7, 9> (cycle of length 4)
        - <1, 3, 7, 2> (cycle of length 4)
        - <1, 8, 9, 3> (cycle of length 4)
        - <1, 8, 9, 4> (cycle of length 4)
        - <1, 8, 0, 3> (cycle of length 4)
        - <1, 8, 0, 4> (cycle of length 4)
        - <1, 8, 5, 6> (cycle of length 4)
        - <1, 8, 5, 8> (cycle of length 4)
        - <3, 1, 4, 9, 0> (cycle of length 5)
        - <3, 1, 8, 9, 4> (cycle of length 5)
        - <3, 1, 8, 0, 9> (cycle of length 5)
        - <3, 7, 9, 8, 0> (cycle of length 5)
        - <3, 7, 2, 8, 9> (cycle of length 5)
        - <5, 8, 9, 4, 0> (cycle of length 5)
        - <5, 8, 0, 9, 3> (cycle of length 5)
        - <6, 5, 8, 9, 4> (cycle of length 5)
        - <6, 5, 8, 0, 9> (cycle of length 5)
        - <6, 2, 7, 9, 0> (cycle of length 5)
        - <6, 2, 4, 9, 0> (cycle of length 5)
        - <2, 6, 8, 9, 3> (cycle of length 5)
        - <2, 6, 8, 0, 9> (cycle of length 5)
        - <2, 7, 9, 8, 0> (cycle of length 5)
        - <2, 4, 9, 0, 3> (cycle of length 5)
        - <8, 1, 7, 9, 0> (cycle of length 5)
        - <8, 1, 3, 9, 4> (cycle of length 5)
        - <8, 1, 7, 2, 4> (cycle of length 5)
        - <8, 1, 4, 9, 0> (cycle of length 5)
        - <8, 5, 6, 2, 7> (cycle of length 5)
        - <8, 5, 6, 8, 9> (cycle of length 5)
        - <8, 5, 6, 2, 4> (cycle of length 5)
        - <8, 6, 2, 7, 9> (cycle of length 5)
        - <8, 6, 2, 4, 9> (cycle of length 5)
        - <9, 3, 1, 4, 0> (cycle of length 5)
        - <9, 3, 7, 2, 4> (cycle of length 5)
        - <9, 8, 1, 4, 0> (cycle of length 5)
        - <9, 8, 5, 6, 2> (cycle of length 5)
        - <9, 8, 5, 6, 8> (cycle of length 5)
        - <9, 8, 6, 2, 4> (cycle of length 5)
        - <7, 1, 8, 9, 0> (cycle of length 5)
        - <7, 1, 3, 9, 4> (cycle of length 5)
        - <7, 1, 8, 5, 6> (cycle of length 5)
        - <7, 3, 9, 8, 0> (cycle of length 5)
        - <7, 3, 0, 9, 4> (cycle of length 5)
        - <7, 2, 6, 5, 8> (cycle of length 5)
        - <7, 2, 6, 8, 9> (cycle of length 5)
        - <7, 2, 4, 9, 0> (cycle of length 5)
        - <0, 3, 1, 8, 9> (cycle of length 5)
        - <0, 3, 7, 2, 9> (cycle of length 5)
        - <0, 4, 9, 8, 1> (cycle of length 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - <1, 8, 9, 4> has one chord: (8, 4)
        - <1, 8, 0, 3> has one chord: (8, 3)
        - <3, 7, 2, 8> has one chord: (7, 8)
        - <5, 8, 9, 4> has one chord: (8, 4)
        - <2, 7, 9, 8> has one chord: (7, 8)
        - <8, 1, 7, 2> has one chord: (1, 2)
        - <9, 4, 0, 3> has one chord: (4, 3)
        - <8, 5, 6, 2> has one chord: (5, 2)
        - <7, 1, 8, 9> has one chord: (1, 9)
        - <3, 0, 9, 4> has one chord: (0, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord.
        So, the final count is [10].
