Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 5) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 5) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. (1, 3, 0, 2)
2. (1, 4, 10, 6)
3. (1, 13, 11, 9)
4. (1, 0, 14, 6)
5. (3, 1, 2, 8)
6. (3, 0, 12, 8)
7. (10, 6, 7, 5)
8. (10, 4, 13, 11)
9. (11, 9, 8, 7)
10. (2, 1, 4, 13)
11. (2, 8, 12, 5)
12. (2, 6, 14, 0)
13. (8, 2, 9, 11)
14. (8, 7, 5, 4)
15. (0, 1, 3, 12)
16. (0, 14, 6, 7)

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the ones with exactly one chord are:
1. (1, 3, 0, 2) - <(1, 3),(0, 2)>
2. (1, 13, 11, 9) - <(1, 13),(11, 9)>
3. (3, 1, 2, 8) - <(3, 1),(2, 8)>
4. (10, 6, 7, 5) - <(10, 6),(7, 5)>
5. (2, 1, 4, 13) - <(2, 1),(4, 13)>
6. (0, 1, 3, 12) - <(0, 1),(3, 12)>

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final answer is [6].
