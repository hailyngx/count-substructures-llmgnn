Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 2) (7, 13) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 1) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-13-5-1
- Cycle 2: 2-4-13-7-2
- Cycle 3: 2-9-14-10-2
- Cycle 4: 3-5-13-11-3
- Cycle 5: 6-2-7-13-6
- Cycle 6: 6-8-9-2-6
- Cycle 7: 6-10-14-9-6
- Cycle 8: 6-12-11-13-6
- Cycle 9: 6-0-5-13-6
- Cycle 10: 6-2-9-14-6
- Cycle 11: 8-9-2-4-8
- Cycle 12: 10-14-9-8-10
- Cycle 13: 10-1-4-2-10
- Cycle 14: 10-6-12-11-10
- Cycle 15: 11-13-12-6-11
- Cycle 16: 12-13-5-0-12

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (5, 13), 2, 4)> (Cycle 1 with chord 5-13)
- <2, (4, 13), 7, 13)> (Cycle 2 with chord 4-13)
- <2, (9, 14), 10, 2)> (Cycle 3 with chord 9-14)
- <3, (13, 5), 11, 3)> (Cycle 4 with chord 13-5)
- <6, (2, 7), 13, 6)> (Cycle 5 with chord 2-7)
- <6, (9, 2), 8, 6)> (Cycle 6 with chord 9-2)
- <6, (10, 14), 9, 6)> (Cycle 7 with chord 10-14)
- <6, (11, 13), 12, 6)> (Cycle 8 with chord 11-13)
- <6, (5, 13), 0, 6)> (Cycle 9 with chord 5-13)
- <6, (9, 2), 14, 6)> (Cycle 10 with chord 9-2)
- <8, (9, 2), 4, 8)> (Cycle 11 with chord 9-2)
- <10, (9, 14), 8, 10)> (Cycle 12 with chord 9-14)
- <10, (4, 1), 2, 10)> (Cycle 13 with chord 4-1)
- <10, (12, 11), 6, 10)> (Cycle 14 with chord 12-11)
- <11, (13, 12), 6, 11)> (Cycle 15 with chord 13-12)
- <12, (5, 0), 13, 12)> (Cycle 16 with chord 5-0)

Step 3:
There are 16 chordal 4-cycles found, which means there are [16] chordless cycles in the graph.
