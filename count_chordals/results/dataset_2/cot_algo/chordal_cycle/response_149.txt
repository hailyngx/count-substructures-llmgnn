Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: (6, 9, 4, 8, 2, 1, 6)
        - Cycle 2: (6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 6)
        - Cycle 3: (6, 3, 2, 1, 12, 6)
        - Cycle 4: (9, 4, 8, 14, 13, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 5: (9, 7, 8, 4, 9)
        - Cycle 6: (1, 6, 10, 3, 2, 1)
        - Cycle 7: (1, 3, 2, 4, 1)
        - Cycle 8: (8, 4, 2, 3, 8)
        - Cycle 9: (8, 7, 14, 13, 12, 8)
        - Cycle 10: (2, 1, 12, 13, 14, 2)
        - Cycle 11: (2, 3, 10, 13, 2)
        - Cycle 12: (2, 8, 7, 14, 13, 2)
        - Cycle 13: (0, 2, 3, 10, 13, 0)
        - Cycle 14: (0, 11, 12, 13, 14, 0)
        - Cycle 15: (14, 8, 4, 9, 7, 14)
        - Cycle 16: (12, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12)
        - Cycle 17: (12, 5, 0, 2, 3, 12)
        - Cycle 18: (13, 2, 1, 6, 10, 13)
        - Cycle 19: (13, 7, 8, 4, 2, 13)
        - Cycle 20: (13, 12, 11, 0, 5, 13)

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 4), 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, (1, 12), 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, (4, 8), 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (1, 12), 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <8, (4, 2), 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <2, (1, 12), 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <12, (5, 0), 11>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <13, (7, 8), 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <2, (1, 12), 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <13, (7, 8), 2>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are a total of [10] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
