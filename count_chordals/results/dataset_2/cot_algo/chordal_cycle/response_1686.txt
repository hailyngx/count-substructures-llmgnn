Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (1, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 4) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 2)
- Cycle 2: (7, 12, 0, 9)
- Cycle 3: (7, 12, 3, 8)
- Cycle 4: (7, 2, 13, 3)
- Cycle 5: (14, 1, 11, 7)
- Cycle 6: (14, 4, 0, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (12, 9)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (12, 8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (2, 3)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (4, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
- <1, (7, 12), 5>
- <2, (12, 8), 7>
- <3, (2, 3), 13>
- <4, (1, 7), 11>
- <5, (4, 0), 14>
