Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 0) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 15) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 15) (3, 5) (3, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 13) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 1) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 11-7-13-6-11
        - Cycle 2: 11-10-9-8-11
        - Cycle 3: 11-10-13-6-11
        - Cycle 4: 11-0-1-17-11
        - Cycle 5: 16-0-19-12-16
        - Cycle 6: 4-15-17-1-4
        - Cycle 7: 5-19-0-1-5
        - Cycle 8: 5-3-6-13-5
        - Cycle 9: 2-12-19-0-2
        - Cycle 10: 9-8-14-15-9
        - Cycle 11: 10-9-8-14-10
        - Cycle 12: 10-18-1-17-10
        - Cycle 13: 18-1-17-4-18
        - Cycle 14: 18-6-13-10-18

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord 7-13 and is a chordal 4-cycle <11, 7, 13, 6>
        - Cycle 2 has a chord 10-9 and is a chordal 4-cycle <11, 10, 9, 8>
        - Cycle 3 has a chord 10-13 and is a chordal 4-cycle <11, 10, 13, 6>
        - Cycle 4 has a chord 0-1 and is a chordal 4-cycle <11, 0, 1, 17>
        - Cycle 5 has a chord 0-19 and is a chordal 4-cycle <16, 0, 19, 12>
        - Cycle 6 has a chord 15-17 and is a chordal 4-cycle <4, 15, 17, 1>
        - Cycle 7 has a chord 0-1 and is a chordal 4-cycle <5, 19, 0, 1>
        - Cycle 8 has a chord 3-6 and is a chordal 4-cycle <5, 3, 6, 13>
        - Cycle 9 has a chord 12-19 and is a chordal 4-cycle <2, 12, 19, 0>
        - Cycle 10 has a chord 8-14 and is a chordal 4-cycle <9, 8, 14, 15>
        - Cycle 11 has a chord 9-8 and is a chordal 4-cycle <10, 9, 8, 14>
        - Cycle 12 has a chord 1-17 and is a chordal 4-cycle <10, 1, 17, 4>
        - Cycle 13 has a chord 1-17 and is a chordal 4-cycle <18, 1, 17, 4>
        - Cycle 14 has a chord 6-13 and is a chordal 4-cycle <18, 6, 13, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 14 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
