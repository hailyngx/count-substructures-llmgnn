Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 1) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 18) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 12) (1, 9) (2, 9) (2, 3) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 3) (13, 7) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 19) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 13, 6, 16, 10)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 8, 12, 11, 14)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 8, 12, 16, 10)
- Cycle 4: (4, 10, 16, 12, 8, 7)
- Cycle 5: (4, 10, 17, 16, 6, 13)
- Cycle 6: (4, 14, 0, 11, 12, 8)
- Cycle 7: (4, 14, 11, 12, 16, 10)
- Cycle 8: (6, 13, 7, 8, 12, 16)
- Cycle 9: (6, 16, 12, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 10: (6, 16, 10, 17, 18, 15)
- Cycle 11: (8, 12, 11, 0, 14, 4)
- Cycle 12: (8, 12, 16, 6, 13, 7)
- Cycle 13: (10, 16, 6, 13, 7, 4)
- Cycle 14: (12, 16, 10, 17, 18, 15)
- Cycle 15: (14, 11, 0, 4, 10, 17)
- Cycle 16: (16, 10, 17, 18, 15, 12)
- Cycle 17: (16, 12, 8, 4, 10, 17)
- Cycle 18: (16, 12, 11, 14, 4, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <4, (7, 13), 6, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (7, 8), 12, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (10, 16), 12, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (10, 17), 16, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, (13, 7), 8, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (16, 12), 8, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <8, (12, 16), 10, 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <14, (11, 0), 4, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <16, (10, 17), 18, 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <16, (12, 8), 4, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
