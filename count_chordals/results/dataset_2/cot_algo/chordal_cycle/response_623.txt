Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 18) (16, 19) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 18) (17, 0) (17, 9) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 15) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 17) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
        - Cycle 1: (7, 11, 10, 2, 5, 16, 19, 13, 3, 12, 4, 7)
        - Cycle 2: (8, 7, 11, 10, 2, 5, 13, 3, 12, 14, 8)
        - Cycle 3: (18, 11, 10, 2, 5, 13, 19, 16, 5, 12, 3, 15, 1, 18)
        - Cycle 4: (18, 11, 7, 4, 12, 3, 13, 5, 2, 0, 17, 9, 15, 1, 18)
        - Cycle 5: (6, 4, 12, 14, 8, 7, 11, 18, 1, 15, 9, 17, 0, 2, 10, 8, 14, 3, 13, 5, 16, 19, 6)
        
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - <1, (2, 5)> in cycle 1
        - <2, (13, 3)> in cycle 2
        - <3, (16, 19)> in cycle 3
        - <4, (18, 11)> in cycle 4
        - <5, (12, 14)> in cycle 5
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0] 

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
