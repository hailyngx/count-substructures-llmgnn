Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 2) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 26) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 28) (3, 1) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 22) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 25) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 22) (25, 11) (25, 20) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 19) (27, 5) (2, 14) (2, 16) (29, 14) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 24) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 8) (21, 27) (21, 28) (28, 14) (28, 1) (28, 21) (13, 11) (13, 15) (26, 17) (26, 11) (5, 27) (18, 20) (18, 23) (18, 24) (9, 17) (9, 29) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 7) (6, 17) (6, 22) (23, 18) (23, 24) (24, 3) (24, 29) (24, 18) (24, 23) (24, 19) (19, 17) (19, 27) (19, 24) (0, 4) (0, 8) (15, 4) (15, 13) (22, 10) (22, 20) (22, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 14 - 17 - 6 - 16 - 14
- Cycle 2: 1 - 3 - 16 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 3 - 24 - 29 - 20 - 22 - 10 - 11 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 3 - 24 - 18 - 20 - 29 - 9 - 17 - 14 - 28 - 21 - 27 - 5 - 27 - 19 - 24 - 3

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord (17, 6)
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has no chords
- Cycle 4 has chord (29, 24)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
We found 1 chordal 4-cycle among the cycles listed above.

Thus, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1 - 3 - 24 - 29 - 20 - 22 - 10 - 11 - 1>, with a chord (29, 24).
