Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 9) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 9) (4, 9) (4, 13) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 4) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 3, 7, 12)
- (1, 3, 9, 12)
- (1, 3, 10, 2)
- (1, 3, 14, 2)
- (1, 6, 8, 2)
- (1, 6, 11, 2)
- (1, 11, 2, 8)
- (1, 11, 5, 12)
- (3, 7, 12, 1)
- (3, 7, 9, 12)
- (3, 10, 2, 14)
- (3, 11, 2, 14)
- (7, 8, 2, 10)
- (7, 12, 1, 5)
- (12, 5, 11, 1)
- (12, 7, 3, 1)
- (2, 8, 6, 1)
- (2, 8, 10, 3)
- (2, 11, 1, 6)
- (2, 11, 3, 14)
- (8, 6, 11, 1)
- (8, 7, 3, 10)
- (11, 5, 12, 1)
- (11, 6, 1, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, 6, 8, 2> (Chord: (6, 8))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There is one unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
