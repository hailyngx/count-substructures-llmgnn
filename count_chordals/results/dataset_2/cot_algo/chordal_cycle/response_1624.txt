Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4: 
1. (5, 8, 2, 0, 5)
2. (5, 1, 0, 2, 5)
3. (5, 4, 9, 7, 5)
4. (5, 0, 2, 6, 5)
5. (9, 4, 6, 2, 9)
6. (9, 1, 0, 5, 9)
7. (9, 7, 8, 5, 9)
8. (4, 5, 1, 0, 4)
9. (4, 9, 7, 8, 4)
10. (4, 3, 2, 6, 4)
11. (4, 6, 2, 8, 4)
12. (7, 9, 1, 5, 7)
13. (7, 8, 2, 0, 7)
14. (2, 8, 5, 1, 2)
15. (2, 6, 4, 3, 2)
16. (2, 3, 4, 1, 2)
17. (8, 5, 1, 4, 8)
18. (8, 7, 9, 4, 8)
19. (8, 2, 6, 4, 8)
20. (0, 5, 1, 9, 0)
21. (0, 2, 8, 7, 0)
22. (1, 5, 4, 9, 1)
23. (1, 9, 4, 6, 1)
24. (6, 4, 3, 2, 6)
25. (6, 2, 8, 7, 6)
26. (3, 4, 6, 2, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (5, 9), 4>
2. <2, (8, 7), 6>
3. <3, (4, 6), 2>
4. <4, (5, 1), 9>
5. <5, (8, 2), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles is [5].
