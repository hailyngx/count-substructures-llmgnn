Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 17) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 5) (1, 0) (1, 19) (17, 15) (17, 13) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 10) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 10) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 8) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 12) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 6) (12, 3) (12, 19) (10, 13) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
  - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 13, 0, 4, 16, 2)
  - Cycle 2: (3, 15, 19, 1, 0, 13, 17)
  - Cycle 3: (11, 18, 10, 13, 0, 4, 16)
  - Cycle 4: (15, 19, 12, 3, 11, 18, 10)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
  - Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (9, 5) and (13, 0)
  - Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (19, 1)
  - Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (18, 10)
  - Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (19, 12)
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
  - There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph, so the count is [0].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
  - Since no chordal 4-cycles exist, there are no cycles to list.
