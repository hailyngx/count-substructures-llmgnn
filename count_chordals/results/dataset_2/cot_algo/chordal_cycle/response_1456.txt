Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 9) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-10-6-3-1
- Cycle 2: 1-11-12-14-1
- Cycle 3: 1-13-2-12-1

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 <1, (10, 6), 3>
- Cycle 2 <1, (11, 12), 14>
- Cycle 3 <1, (13, 2), 12>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
