Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (4, 10, 5, 14)
- Cycle 2: (7, 4, 8, 11)
- Cycle 3: (7, 2, 13, 5)
- Cycle 4: (8, 12, 3, 11)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 6: (6, 10, 13, 2)
- Cycle 7: (13, 14, 3, 11)
- Cycle 8: (3, 2, 7, 1)
- Cycle 9: (3, 12, 0, 6)
- Cycle 10: (11, 8, 4, 14)
- Cycle 11: (1, 9, 0, 6)

Step 2: 
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (9, 6), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (13, 7), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (11, 12), 8>

Step 3:
There are [3] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
