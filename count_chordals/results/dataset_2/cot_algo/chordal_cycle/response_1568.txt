Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are three cycles of length 4 in the graph: 
1. Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 6, 5)
2. Cycle 2: (7, 2, 8, 6, 7)
3. Cycle 3: (9, 2, 4, 3, 9)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
1. Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 6, 5), chords: (9, 6)
2. Cycle 2: (7, 2, 8, 6, 7), chords: (2, 6)
3. Cycle 3: (9, 2, 4, 3, 9), chords: (2, 3)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, (9, 6)>  
<7, (2, 6)>  
<9, (2, 3)>
