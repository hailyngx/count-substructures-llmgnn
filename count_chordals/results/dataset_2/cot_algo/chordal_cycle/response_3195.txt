Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 19) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 13) (1, 27) (3, 10) (3, 12) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 25) (23, 15) (23, 21) (23, 10) (12, 3) (12, 27) (12, 18) (27, 1) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 26) (4, 22) (4, 14) (4, 26) (8, 16) (8, 25) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 13) (28, 2) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 11) (6, 5) (6, 0) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 21) (26, 22) (26, 27) (26, 4) (11, 28) (11, 29) (11, 25) (11, 2) (24, 1) (24, 20) (20, 29) (20, 17) (20, 24) (15, 1) (15, 23) (21, 23) (21, 17) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 19) (7, 18) (14, 22) (14, 4) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 0) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 25) (13, 19) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 11) (25, 13) (10, 3) (10, 23) (18, 12) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 16) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 13) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 0, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 19, 7, 18, 9)
- Cycle 3: (12, 3, 10, 23, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (7, 18)
- Cycle 3 does not have a chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 9), 6, 0>
- <2, (7, 18), 19, 9>
