Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 15) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 18) (2, 14) (2, 12) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 18) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 19) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 19) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 9) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 15) (10, 0) (10, 9) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 3-11-13-5-3
- Cycle 2: 3-11-6-16-3
- Cycle 3: 3-8-18-0-3
- Cycle 4: 5-13-12-7-5
- Cycle 5: 5-13-1-17-5
- Cycle 6: 5-1-15-16-5
- Cycle 7: 5-1-17-14-5
- Cycle 8: 5-1-13-12-5
- Cycle 9: 0-18-8-4-0
- Cycle 10: 0-18-12-7-0
- Cycle 11: 0-18-3-8-0
- Cycle 12: 0-18-12-2-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <3, (8, 18), 0, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Based on the above analysis, there is 11 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
