Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
        - There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
        - No chordal 4-cycles can be identified as there are no cycles of sufficient length.

Step 3:
        Since no chordal 4-cycles were found, the final count is [0].
