Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 14, 11, 10)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 9, 1, 7, 10)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 9, 1, 2, 12)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 9, 1, 8, 10)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 9, 1, 8, 3)
        - Cycle 6: (5, 9, 14, 13, 12)
        - Cycle 7: (5, 12, 2, 7, 10)
        - Cycle 8: (5, 12, 2, 7, 1)
        - Cycle 9: (5, 12, 2, 8, 10)
        - Cycle 10: (5, 12, 2, 8, 3)
        - Cycle 11: (5, 12, 6, 3, 14)
        - Cycle 12: (5, 4, 11, 7, 10)
        - Cycle 13: (5, 4, 11, 14, 13)
        - Cycle 14: (5, 4, 6, 12, 2)
        - Cycle 15: (5, 3, 6, 12, 2)
        - Cycle 16: (5, 3, 14, 13, 12)
        - Cycle 17: (9, 1, 7, 10, 11)
        - Cycle 18: (9, 14, 11, 7, 10)
        - Cycle 19: (9, 14, 11, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 20: (9, 14, 13, 0, 12)
        - Cycle 21: (10, 7, 2, 12, 6)
        - Cycle 22: (10, 7, 11, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 23: (10, 8, 2, 12, 6)
        - Cycle 24: (11, 4, 6, 12, 2)
        - Cycle 25: (11, 7, 1, 9, 14)
        - Cycle 26: (11, 7, 10, 8, 3)
        - Cycle 27: (12, 2, 7, 1, 9)
        - Cycle 28: (12, 5, 4, 11, 7)
        - Cycle 29: (12, 5, 3, 6, 4)
        - Cycle 30: (12, 5, 9, 1, 7)
        - Cycle 31: (12, 5, 9, 1, 8)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (7, 10), 11, 14>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (7, 1), 9, 12>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, (8, 3), 7, 10>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (6, 12), 2, 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, (3, 14), 13, 12>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 31 cycles in total, and 5 of them contain exactly one chord.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [5].
