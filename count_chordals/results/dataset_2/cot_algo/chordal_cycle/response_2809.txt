Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 14) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 18) (7, 0) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 1) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 16) (15, 17) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 15) (16, 1) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (10, 6) (10, 3) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 3) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 3) (1, 19) (1, 16) (1, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 5) (11, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 12, 8, 19, 4) 
- Cycle 2: (5, 11, 18, 7, 0, 2, 9) 
- Cycle 3: (9, 13, 14, 6, 3, 4, 17) 
- Cycle 4: (9, 13, 14, 6, 10, 3, 4) 
- Cycle 5: (9, 16, 15, 17, 4, 19, 1) 
- Cycle 6: (18, 11, 5, 9, 2, 0, 7) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (12, 2)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (18, 2)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (13, 6)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (13, 10)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (16, 1)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (11, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (12, 2), 8, 19, 4>
- <2, (18, 2), 9, 13, 14>
- <3, (13, 6), 9, 2, 12>
- <4, (13, 10), 9, 6, 14>
- <5, (16, 1), 9, 17, 4>
- <6, (11, 7), 18, 5, 9>
