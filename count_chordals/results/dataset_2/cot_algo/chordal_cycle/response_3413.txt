Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 28) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 16) (21, 4) (21, 25) (21, 15) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 25) (8, 7) (8, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 27) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 22) (11, 18) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 20) (17, 12) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 28) (7, 8) (7, 25) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 7) (0, 7) (0, 29) (0, 23) (22, 11) (22, 27) (16, 21) (16, 15) (6, 8) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 4) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 10) (24, 15) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 28) (23, 0) (26, 27) (27, 3) (27, 22) (27, 26) (29, 0) (29, 10) (18, 11) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 13) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 24) (13, 1) (13, 20) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 24) (10, 29) (10, 4) (28, 9) (28, 20) (28, 14) (19, 1) (19, 7) (4, 21) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (11, 3, 2, 15, 21, 16, 15, 9, 5, 24, 6, 14, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 3, 2, 15, 21, 16, 15, 9, 5, 24, 6, 4, 21, 25, 8, 7, 13, 1, 12, 17, 11)
- Cycle 3: (11, 3, 2, 15, 21, 16, 15, 9, 5, 24, 6, 14, 28, 20, 17, 12, 1, 13, 7, 25, 21)
- Cycle 4: (11, 3, 2, 15, 21, 16, 15, 9, 5, 24, 6, 14, 28, 20, 13, 1, 19, 7, 25, 8, 6, 4, 21, 25)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (8, 25) connecting non-adjacent nodes 8 and 25.
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (9, 28) connecting non-adjacent nodes 9 and 28.
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (15, 9) connecting non-adjacent nodes 15 and 9.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There is 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <11, 3, 2, 15>.
