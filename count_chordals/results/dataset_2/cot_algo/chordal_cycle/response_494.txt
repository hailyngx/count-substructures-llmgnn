Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-0-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-6-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-6-9-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-9-8-1
- Cycle 5: 1-7-8-9-1
- Cycle 6: 1-7-8-6-1
- Cycle 7: 1-8-9-6-1
- Cycle 8: 1-8-0-3-1
- Cycle 9: 1-9-6-2-1
- Cycle 10: 1-9-8-7-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1-3-0-5-1> has no chord.
- <1-4-6-2-1> has chord (4, 2).
- <1-4-6-9-1> has chord (4, 9).
- <1-6-9-8-1> has chord (6, 8).
- <1-7-8-9-1> has chord (7, 9).
- <1-7-8-6-1> has chord (7, 6).
- <1-8-9-6-1> has chord (8, 6).
- <1-8-0-3-1> has chord (8, 3).
- <1-9-6-2-1> has chord (9, 2).
- <1-9-8-7-1> has chord (9, 7).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1-4-6-2-1> with chord (4, 2)
<1-4-6-9-1> with chord (4, 9)
<1-6-9-8-1> with chord (6, 8)
<1-7-8-9-1> with chord (7, 9)
<1-7-8-6-1> with chord (7, 6)
<1-8-9-6-1> with chord (8, 6)
<1-8-0-3-1> with chord (8, 3)
<1-9-6-2-1> with chord (9, 2)
<1-9-8-7-1> with chord (9, 7)
