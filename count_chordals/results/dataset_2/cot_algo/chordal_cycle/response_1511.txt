Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0-4-9-8-6-7-0
- Cycle 2: 1-8-9-4-0-7-1
- Cycle 3: 2-5-3-4-0-7-2
- Cycle 4: 3-5-2-6-1-8-9-3
- Cycle 5: 3-5-2-8-1-6-7-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord (4, 8): <1, (4, 8), 0>
- Cycle 2 has a chord (8, 4): <2, (8, 4), 1>
- Cycle 3 has a chord (4, 0): <3, (4, 0), 2>
- Cycle 4 has a chord (8, 9): <4, (8, 9), 3>
- Cycle 5 has a chord (8, 6): <5, (8, 6), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. Since all cycles found have chords, the count is [0].
