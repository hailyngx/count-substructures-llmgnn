Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 27) (15, 1) (15, 10) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 25) (17, 6) (2, 8) (2, 12) (18, 14) (18, 21) (18, 25) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 19) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 26) (8, 27) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 0) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 26) (6, 17) (6, 28) (6, 20) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 22) (9, 21) (22, 9) (22, 0) (26, 8) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 16) (5, 20) (19, 12) (19, 25) (19, 16) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 24) (10, 15) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 4) (21, 18) (21, 9) (21, 10) (21, 16) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 23) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 25) (16, 26) (16, 19) (16, 21) (0, 28) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 13) (27, 3) (27, 8) (27, 29) (20, 6) (20, 5) (20, 4) (24, 1) (24, 0) (4, 10) (4, 23) (4, 20) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 4) (25, 14) (25, 18) (25, 19) (25, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Step 3:
- The final number of chordal 4-cycles found is [0].
