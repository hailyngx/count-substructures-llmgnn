Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 7, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 7, 8, 9)
- Cycle 3: (4, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 4: (3, 7, 0, 3)
- Cycle 5: (6, 1, 9, 6)
- Cycle 6: (2, 3, 8, 2)
- Cycle 7: (8, 0, 1, 8)
- Cycle 8: (5, 0, 1, 5)
- Cycle 9: (7, 8, 9, 7)
- Cycle 10: (4, 3, 7, 4)
- Cycle 11: (6, 2, 3, 6)
- Cycle 12: (9, 4, 6, 9)
- Cycle 13: (0, 5, 3, 0)
- Cycle 14: (5, 2, 3, 5)
- Cycle 15: (5, 7, 8, 5)
- Cycle 16: (6, 4, 3, 6)
- Cycle 17: (9, 8, 3, 9)
- Cycle 18: (1, 0, 7, 1)
- Cycle 19: (4, 9, 1, 4)
- Cycle 20: (0, 1, 6, 0)
- Cycle 21: (3, 5, 0, 3)
- Cycle 22: (3, 4, 9, 3)
- Cycle 23: (7, 9, 4, 7)
- Cycle 24: (8, 7, 0, 8)
- Cycle 25: (2, 5, 7, 2)
- Cycle 26: (2, 6, 8, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <5, (0, 7), 3>
2. <9, (7, 8), 4>
3. <4, (6, 1), 9>
4. <0, (1, 8), 7>
5. <5, (2, 3), 7>
6. <8, (0, 1), 7>
7. <3, (4, 9), 7>
8. <6, (2, 3), 1>
9. <7, (4, 9), 3>
10. <8, (6, 2), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [16] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
