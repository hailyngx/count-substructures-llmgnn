Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 21) (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 28) (21, 22) (21, 1) (21, 29) (21, 4) (2, 29) (2, 0) (29, 21) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 3) (27, 11) (27, 16) (27, 8) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 25) (23, 8) (23, 16) (23, 10) (23, 20) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 24) (17, 29) (17, 26) (17, 4) (11, 27) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 6) (28, 22) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 10) (18, 26) (18, 9) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 7) (7, 26) (25, 8) (15, 13) (15, 19) (5, 12) (5, 11) (19, 11) (19, 15) (16, 29) (16, 27) (16, 23) (9, 14) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 12) (3, 9) (3, 6) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 10) (24, 8) (24, 14) (10, 12) (10, 23) (10, 28) (10, 20) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 17) (4, 6) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all edges existing:
- Cycle 1: (13, 22, 21, 1, 13)
- Cycle 2: (1, 21, 29, 2, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 21, 4, 6, 1)
- Cycle 4: (27, 8, 23, 16, 27)
- Cycle 5: (29, 16, 23, 10, 29)
- Cycle 6: (0, 2, 29, 16, 0)
- Cycle 7: (8, 27, 11, 19, 8)
- Cycle 8: (28, 9, 14, 0, 28)
- Cycle 9: (14, 24, 8, 27, 14)
- Cycle 10: (17, 29, 2, 0, 17)
- Cycle 11: (26, 18, 9, 14, 26)
- Cycle 12: (15, 19, 11, 5, 15)
- Cycle 13: (25, 8, 24, 14, 25)
- Cycle 14: (4, 21, 29, 2, 4)
- Cycle 15: (16, 29, 2, 0, 16)
- Cycle 16: (9, 14, 24, 8, 9)
- Cycle 17: (3, 12, 0, 2, 3)
- Cycle 18: (10, 23, 8, 27, 10)
- Cycle 19: (22, 28, 1, 21, 22)
- Cycle 20: (26, 7, 18, 9, 26)
- Cycle 21: (7, 26, 17, 4, 7)
- Cycle 22: (20, 1, 21, 29, 20)
- Cycle 23: (20, 23, 16, 29, 20)
- Cycle 24: (12, 3, 6, 4, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (21, 29), 2, 1>
- <1, (21, 4), 6, 1>
- <27, (8, 23), 16, 27>
- <29, (16, 23), 10, 29>
- <0, (2, 29), 16, 0>
- <8, (27, 11), 19, 8>
- <28, (9, 14), 0, 28>
- <14, (24, 8), 27, 14>
- <17, (29, 2), 0, 17>
- <26, (18, 9), 14, 26>
- <15, (19, 11), 5, 15>
- <25, (8, 24), 14, 25>
- <4, (21, 29), 2, 4>
- <16, (29, 2), 0, 16>
- <9, (14, 24), 8, 9>
- <3, (12, 0), 2, 3>
- <10, (23, 8), 27, 10>
- <22, (28, 1), 21, 22>
- <26, (7, 18), 9, 26>
- <7, (26, 17), 4, 7>
- <20, (1, 21), 29, 20>
- <20, (23, 16), 29, 20>
- <12, (3, 6), 4, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [23]
