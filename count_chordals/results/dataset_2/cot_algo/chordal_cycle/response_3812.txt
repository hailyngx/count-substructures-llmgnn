Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 9, 2, 8, 5)
- (5, 9, 3, 7, 5)
- (5, 9, 4, 0, 5)
- (5, 0, 3, 7, 5)
- (5, 0, 8, 2, 5)
- (5, 3, 7, 1, 5)
- (5, 3, 0, 4, 5)
- (9, 2, 4, 0, 9)
- (9, 3, 0, 8, 9)
- (9, 3, 4, 2, 9)
- (2, 8, 0, 6, 2)
- (3, 7, 1, 9, 3)
- (3, 7, 8, 0, 3)
- (3, 0, 4, 2, 3)
- (0, 6, 8, 5, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle found:
- <5, (9, 2), 8, 5>
- <5, (9, 4), 0, 5>
- <5, (0, 3), 7, 5>
- <5, (0, 8), 2, 5>
- <9, (3, 0), 8, 9>
- <9, (3, 4), 2, 9>
- <3, (7, 1), 9, 3>
- <3, (7, 8), 0, 3>
- <0, (6, 8), 5, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
