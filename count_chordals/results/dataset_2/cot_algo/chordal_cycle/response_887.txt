21. <12, 5, 8, 4, 12>
22. <13, 12, 5, 10, 13>
23. <13, 15, 0, 17, 13>
24. <14, 18, 4, 8, 14>
25. <14, 19, 2, 10, 14>
26. <16, 4, 18, 14, 16>

31. <18, 14, 19, 2, 18>
32. <19, 14, 18, 4, 19>

Step 2: 
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
1. <1, 6, 8, 4, 1> has chord (6, 8) 
2. <1, 11, 12, 13, 1> has chord (11, 12)
3. <4, 18, 14, 19, 4> has chord (18, 14)
4. <10, 15, 0, 17, 10> has chord (15, 0)
5. <12, 13, 15, 0, 12> has chord (13, 15)
6. <14, 19, 2, 10, 14> has chord (19, 2)

Step 3: 
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, 6, 8, 4, 1> (Chord: (6, 8))
2. <1, 11, 12, 13, 1> (Chord: (11, 12))
3. <4, 18, 14, 19, 4> (Chord: (18, 14))
4. <10, 15, 0, 17, 10> (Chord: (15, 0))
5. <12, 13, 15, 0, 12> (Chord: (13, 15))
