Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 17) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 7) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 17) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 19) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (16, 8) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 14) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 12) (14, 7) (4, 11) (7, 8) (7, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 3 - 15 - 1 - 10 - 3
- Cycle 2: 3 - 15 - 12 - 10 - 3
- Cycle 3: 3 - 17 - 1 - 15 - 3
- Cycle 4: 3 - 17 - 19 - 18 - 3
- Cycle 5: 3 - 9 - 11 - 10 - 3
- Cycle 6: 3 - 9 - 6 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 7: 3 - 6 - 13 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 8: 3 - 6 - 5 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 9: 3 - 9 - 17 - 1 - 3
- Cycle 10: 3 - 9 - 11 - 4 - 3
- Cycle 11: 3 - 17 - 1 - 10 - 3
- Cycle 12: 3 - 17 - 19 - 14 - 3
- Cycle 13: 15 - 12 - 14 - 18 - 15
- Cycle 14: 15 - 1 - 17 - 19 - 15
- Cycle 15: 6 - 5 - 8 - 0 - 6
- Cycle 16: 6 - 9 - 17 - 19 - 6

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord <1, 10>
- Cycle 2 has chord <2, 10>
- Cycle 3 has chord <15, 17>
- Cycle 4 has chord <18, 19>
- Cycle 5 has chord <9, 11>
- Cycle 6 has chord <6, 5>
- Cycle 7 has chord <13, 0>
- Cycle 8 has chord <5, 8>
- Cycle 9 has chord <9, 17>
- Cycle 10 has chord <4, 11>
- Cycle 11 has chord <1, 17>
- Cycle 12 has chord <14, 19>
- Cycle 13 has chord <12, 14>
- Cycle 14 has chord <1, 19>
- Cycle 15 has chord <5, 8>
- Cycle 16 has chord <17, 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [16].
