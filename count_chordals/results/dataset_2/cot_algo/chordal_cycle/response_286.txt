Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle: 4-7-9-6-4
2. Cycle: 4-7-5-6-4
3. Cycle: 4-9-8-6-4
4. Cycle: 4-9-2-8-4
5. Cycle: 4-1-6-5-4
6. Cycle: 4-1-9-2-4
7. Cycle: 7-5-6-9-7
8. Cycle: 7-9-8-6-7
9. Cycle: 7-9-2-8-7
10. Cycle: 6-1-4-9-6
11. Cycle: 6-1-5-7-6
12. Cycle: 6-8-9-4-6
13. Cycle: 6-8-2-9-6
14. Cycle: 9-8-6-5-9
15. Cycle: 9-8-2-4-9
16. Cycle: 8-2-9-6-8
17. Cycle: 8-2-3-0-8
18. Cycle: 5-1-4-7-5
19. Cycle: 5-1-6-9-5
20. Cycle: 5-0-3-2-5

Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (4, 6), 9>
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (6, 8), 4>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [18].
