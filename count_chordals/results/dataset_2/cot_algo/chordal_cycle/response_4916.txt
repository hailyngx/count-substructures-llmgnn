Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 0) (2, 7) (2, 16) (18, 4) (18, 11) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 16) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 3) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 1) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 13) (14, 3) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 6) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 16) (15, 4) (15, 9) (12, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (4, 7, 5, 1, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 7, 2, 16, 5, 4)
        - Cycle 3: (4, 18, 11, 6, 16, 2, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 18, 11, 19, 13, 8, 1, 5, 16, 2, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 18, 11, 19, 13, 14, 3, 6, 16, 2, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 6: (4, 10, 0, 13, 14, 3, 6, 16, 2, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 7: (4, 15, 9, 17, 0, 13, 14, 3, 6, 16, 2, 7, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <4, (16, 5), 7)>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        Put this final number inside brackets, [7].
