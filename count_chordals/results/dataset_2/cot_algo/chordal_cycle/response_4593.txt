Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (15, 18) (15, 8) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 8) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (6, 13) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) (5, 3) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 18) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 12, 2, 19, 11, 7, 14)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 8, 15, 18, 19, 2, 12)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 8, 17, 3, 13, 7, 14)
- Cycle 4: (9, 0, 1, 8, 18, 15, 8, 10)
- Cycle 5: (9, 0, 17, 3, 13, 7, 14, 10)
- Cycle 6: (9, 0, 17, 3, 16, 18, 15, 8)
- Cycle 7: (9, 16, 18, 15, 8, 10, 14, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord (2, 14)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 19)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (1, 14)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1, 18)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (0, 14)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (0, 8)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (8, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (2, 14), 11, 7)>
- <0, (1, 19), 12, 2>
- <0, (1, 14), 17, 3>
- <9, (1, 18), 15, 8>
- <9, (0, 14), 13, 7>
- <9, (0, 8), 16, 18>
- <9, (8, 14), 10, 7>
