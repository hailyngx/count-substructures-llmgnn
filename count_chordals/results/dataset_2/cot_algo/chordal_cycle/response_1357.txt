Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 0) (11, 27) (11, 6) (16, 13) (16, 25) (13, 16) (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 17) (4, 13) (4, 22) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 17) (2, 4) (2, 29) (2, 12) (29, 2) (29, 14) (29, 18) (20, 7) (20, 21) (20, 10) (25, 16) (25, 28) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 14) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 15) (26, 17) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 10) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 9) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 9) (28, 25) (28, 26) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 24) (10, 20) (10, 0) (24, 11) (24, 12) (24, 27) (24, 9) (15, 26) (15, 23) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 23) (17, 22) (17, 7) (17, 26) (17, 6) (5, 3) (5, 23) (5, 21) (23, 15) (23, 6) (23, 5) (23, 21) (8, 27) (21, 20) (21, 5) (21, 23) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 24, 12, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 11, 24, 27, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 11, 27, 24, 12, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 13, 4, 7, 20, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 10, 20, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 13, 4, 22, 17, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 10, 20, 21, 5, 0>
- Cycle 8: <1, 12, 24, 11, 0, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 12, 24, 27, 8, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 12, 2, 4, 13, 1>
- Cycle 11: <2, 4, 13, 0, 11, 2>
- Cycle 12: <2, 4, 7, 20, 10, 2>
- Cycle 13: <3, 1, 11, 0, 13, 3>
- Cycle 14: <3, 5, 21, 20, 7, 3>
- Cycle 15: <4, 7, 20, 21, 5, 4>
- Cycle 16: <4, 13, 0, 11, 27, 4>
- Cycle 17: <4, 13, 22, 17, 7, 4>
- Cycle 18: <5, 21, 20, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 19: <6, 17, 26, 19, 9, 6>
- Cycle 20: <6, 23, 5, 21, 20, 6>
- Cycle 21: <7, 20, 21, 5, 23, 7>
- Cycle 22: <9, 24, 12, 2, 29, 9>
- Cycle 23: <14, 29, 2, 4, 13, 14>
- Cycle 24: <15, 26, 17, 22, 13, 15>
- Cycle 25: <17, 22, 13, 0, 11, 17>
- Cycle 26: <19, 26, 17, 22, 13, 19>
- Cycle 27: <23, 6, 11, 0, 13, 23>
- Cycle 28: <23, 21, 20, 10, 0, 23>
- Cycle 29: <24, 11, 0, 13, 4, 24>
- Cycle 30: <25, 16, 13, 4, 7, 25>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 13, 4, 22, 17, 0> has a chord (4, 22)
- <1, 12, 2, 4, 13, 1> has a chord (2, 13)
- <2, 4, 13, 0, 11, 2> has a chord (4, 11)
- <9, 24, 12, 2, 29, 9> has a chord (12, 29)
- <19, 26, 17, 22, 13, 19> has a chord (17, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 30 cycles in total and 5 cycles have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [25].
