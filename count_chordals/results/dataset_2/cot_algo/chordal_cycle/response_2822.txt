Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 20) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 10) (20, 7) (20, 23) (20, 5) (20, 28) (25, 28) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 11) (1, 26) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 27) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 12) (17, 4) (17, 29) (29, 17) (29, 3) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 12) (24, 28) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 2) (6, 23) (0, 1) (0, 22) (0, 2) (10, 21) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 2) (9, 1) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 27) (22, 4) (22, 0) (22, 5) (22, 28) (18, 11) (18, 13) (3, 7) (3, 29) (3, 27) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 8) (14, 23) (12, 26) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 15) (2, 13) (5, 20) (5, 15) (5, 22) (28, 20) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 22) (27, 1) (27, 19) (27, 3) (27, 23) (23, 20) (23, 6) (23, 14) (23, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles present in the graph with length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 7 - 21 - 10 - 15
- Cycle 2: 7 - 21 - 6 - 24
- Cycle 3: 7 - 21 - 10 - 15 - 2
- Cycle 4: 7 - 21 - 10 - 15 - 5
- Cycle 5: 20 - 23 - 6 - 24
- Cycle 6: 20 - 23 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 7: 20 - 23 - 6 - 24
- Cycle 8: 20 - 23 - 14 - 8
- Cycle 9: 20 - 23 - 14 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 10: 20 - 23 - 14 - 8 - 11
- Cycle 11: 20 - 5 - 15 - 10
- Cycle 12: 20 - 5 - 22 - 0
- Cycle 13: 20 - 5 - 22 - 4
- Cycle 14: 26 - 24 - 6 - 21
- Cycle 15: 26 - 24 - 6 - 23
- Cycle 16: 26 - 24 - 6 - 21
- Cycle 17: 26 - 24 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 18: 26 - 24 - 28 - 25
- Cycle 19: 26 - 12 - 11 - 8
- Cycle 20: 26 - 12 - 11 - 18
- Cycle 21: 26 - 12 - 13 - 2
- Cycle 22: 1 - 27 - 3 - 29
- Cycle 23: 1 - 27 - 3 - 7
- Cycle 24: 1 - 27 - 19 - 8
- Cycle 25: 1 - 9 - 27 - 3
- Cycle 26: 1 - 9 - 27 - 19
- Cycle 27: 1 - 9 - 27 - 23
- Cycle 28: 9 - 27 - 3 - 29
- Cycle 29: 9 - 27 - 3 - 7
- Cycle 30: 9 - 1 - 0 - 22

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Among the cycles listed above, only the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 7 - 21 - 10 - 15 with chord 21 - 10
- Cycle 2: 7 - 21 - 6 - 24 with chord 7 - 24
- Cycle 24: 1 - 27 - 19 - 8 with chord 27 - 8

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Hence, there are [3] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <7, 21, 10, 15>
- <7, 21, 6, 24>
- <1, 27, 19, 8>
