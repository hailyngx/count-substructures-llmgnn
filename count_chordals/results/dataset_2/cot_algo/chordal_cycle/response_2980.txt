Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 16) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 19) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 16) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 2) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 15) (19, 12) (19, 11) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 14, 17, 1, 2> 
2. <0, 14, 17, 5, 11>
3. <0, 14, 17, 15, 7>
4. <0, 10, 9, 8, 2>
5. <0, 15, 7, 12, 9>
6. <1, 17, 15, 7, 12>
7. <1, 18, 11, 19, 12>
8. <2, 8, 9, 10, 0>
9. <2, 13, 4, 18, 11>
10. <2, 16, 5, 11, 19>
11. <3, 6, 9, 8, 2>
12. <3, 8, 9, 10, 0>
13. <3, 4, 18, 11, 19>
14. <4, 18, 11, 19, 12>
15. <5, 17, 14, 0, 15>
16. <5, 11, 18, 4, 3>
17. <5, 16, 2, 13, 4>
18. <6, 3, 8, 9, 12>
19. <7, 15, 17, 14, 0>
20. <7, 12, 9, 10, 0>
21. <8, 2, 1, 17, 14>
22. <11, 5, 17, 14, 0>
23. <13, 4, 18, 11, 15>
24. <13, 2, 16, 5, 11>

Step 2:
Checking each of the cycles for exactly one chord:
1. <0, 14, 17, 1, 2> - contains chord (17, 2)
2. <0, 14, 17, 5, 11> - does not contain exactly one chord
3. <0, 14, 17, 15, 7> - does not contain exactly one chord
4. <0, 10, 9, 8, 2> - contains chord (10, 8)
5. <0, 15, 7, 12, 9> - contains chord (7, 9)
6. <1, 17, 15, 7, 12> - contains chord (15, 7)
7. <1, 18, 11, 19, 12> - contains chord (11, 12)
8. <2, 8, 9, 10, 0> - contains chord (9, 10)
9. <2, 13, 4, 18, 11> - contains chord (4, 11)
10. <2, 16, 5, 11, 19> - contains chord (5, 19)
11. <3, 6, 9, 8, 2> - does not contain exactly one chord
12. <3, 8, 9, 10, 0> - contains chord (9, 10)
13. <3, 4, 18, 11, 19> - contains chord (18, 11)
14. <4, 18, 11, 19, 12> - contains chord (18, 12)
15. <5, 17, 14, 0, 15> - contains chord (17, 0)
16. <5, 11, 18, 4, 3> - contains chord (18, 3)
17. <5, 16, 2, 13, 4> - contains chord (2, 13)
18. <6, 3, 8, 9, 12> - does not contain exactly one chord
19. <7, 15, 17, 14, 0> - contains chord (17, 0)
20. <7, 12, 9, 10, 0> - contains chord (9, 10)
21. <8, 2, 1, 17, 14> - contains chord (1, 14)
22. <11, 5, 17, 14, 0> - contains chord (17, 0)
23. <13, 4, 18, 11, 15> - contains chord (4, 15)
24. <13, 2, 16, 5, 11> - does not contain exactly one chord

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [13]
