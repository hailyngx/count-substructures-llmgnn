Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 19) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 7) (17, 6) (17, 9) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 18) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 2) (2, 19) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 15) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 5) (16, 6) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 16) (6, 15) (9, 17) (9, 0) (15, 12) (15, 6) (15, 13) (5, 16) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. (1, 3, 4, 1)
2. (3, 4, 19, 0, 3)
3. (7, 8, 14, 11, 7)
4. (7, 8, 14, 16, 7)
5. (0, 7, 18, 6, 0)
6. (0, 19, 4, 1, 0)
7. (10, 12, 16, 14, 10)
8. (10, 13, 18, 6, 10)
9. (12, 15, 6, 17, 12)
10. (16, 14, 8, 7, 16)
11. (16, 6, 17, 9, 16)
12. (18, 13, 15, 12, 18)

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
<1, 3, 4, 1, (3, 4)>
<7, 8, 14, 11, 7, (8, 14)>
<7, 8, 14, 16, 7, (8, 14)>
<0, 7, 18, 6, 0, (7, 18)>
<10, 12, 16, 14, 10, (12, 16)>
<10, 13, 18, 6, 10, (13, 18)>
<12, 15, 6, 17, 12, (15, 6)>
<16, 14, 8, 7, 16, (14, 8)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have found 8 chordal 4-cycles, so the final answer is [8].
