Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more with all edges present:
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 0, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 7, 8, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 1, 8, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 2, 9, 1, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 3, 9, 5)
- Cycle 6: (9, 1, 8, 0, 9)
- Cycle 7: (1, 8, 3, 7, 1)
- Cycle 8: (3, 7, 8, 6, 3)
- Cycle 9: (7, 3, 5, 9, 7)
- Cycle 10: (4, 0, 8, 6, 4)

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 1, 8, 5) -> Chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 3, 9, 5) -> Chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 6: (9, 1, 8, 0, 9) -> Chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 7: (1, 8, 3, 7, 1) -> Chord (8, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 7, 8, 6, 3) -> Chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 9: (7, 3, 5, 9, 7) -> Chord (3, 5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 9, 1, 8>
<5, 7, 3, 9>
<1, 8, 3, 7>
<3, 7, 8, 6>
