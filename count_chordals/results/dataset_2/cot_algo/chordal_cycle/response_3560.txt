Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 2, 3, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 10, 11, 3, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 8, 11, 13, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 7, 4, 0, 6, 7, 9>
- Cycle 5: <5, 9, 12, 11, 10, 5>
- Cycle 6: <2, 1, 3, 11, 2>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- From the listed cycles, only Cycle 1 <5, 2, 3, 5> has exactly one chord: (2, 3).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- As there is only one chordal 4-cycle in the given graph, the count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<5, 2, 3, 5> with the chord (2, 3)
