Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: (11, 16, 15, 3, 7, 16)
2. Cycle 2: (11, 5, 22, 2, 13, 1)
3. Cycle 3: (16, 7, 3, 15, 20, 21)
4. Cycle 4: (3, 15, 16, 7, 24, 8)
5. Cycle 5: (3, 15, 23, 27, 17, 19, 29, 28, 18, 13, 2, 22)
6. Cycle 6: (3, 7, 24, 17, 19, 29, 28, 18, 13, 1, 22)
7. Cycle 7: (15, 16, 21, 20, 15)
8. Cycle 8: (15, 3, 26, 6, 18, 28, 29, 19, 17, 24, 0)
9. Cycle 9: (15, 3, 26, 14, 23, 27, 17, 19, 29, 28, 18, 6)
10. Cycle 10: (15, 20, 21, 16, 7, 24, 17, 19, 29, 28, 18, 13)
11. Cycle 11: (15, 23, 27, 17, 24, 0, 4, 10, 25, 12, 22, 2)
12. Cycle 12: (4, 0, 22, 2, 13, 8, 24, 7, 16, 21, 20, 15)
13. Cycle 13: (7, 16, 21, 20, 15, 3, 26, 14, 5, 18, 6, 28)
14. Cycle 14: (13, 1, 22, 12, 25, 10, 27, 17, 24, 7, 3, 15)
15. Cycle 15: (16, 21, 20, 15, 3, 26, 6, 18, 5, 14, 23, 9)
16. Cycle 16: (16, 21, 20, 15, 3, 7, 24, 17, 19, 29, 28, 9)
17. Cycle 17: (19, 29, 28, 18, 13, 1, 22, 2, 13, 8, 24, 0)
18. Cycle 18: (26, 3, 15, 16, 7, 24, 17, 19, 29, 28, 18, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has chord (15, 3)
- Cycle 2 has chord (13, 1)
- Cycle 3 has chord (20, 21)
- Cycle 4 has chord (24, 8)
- Cycle 5 has chord (13, 2)
- Cycle 6 has chord (13, 1)
- Cycle 8 has chord (24, 17)
- Cycle 10 has chord (13, 1)
- Cycle 11 has chord (27, 17)
- Cycle 12 has chord (22, 2)
- Cycle 15 has chord (3, 26)
- Cycle 16 has chord (7, 24)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 12 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, so the final count is [12].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, (15, 3)>
<2, (13, 1)>
<3, (20, 21)>
<4, (24, 8)>
<5, (13, 2)>
<6, (24, 17)>
<7, (27, 17)>
<8, (22, 2)>
<9, (3, 26)>
<10, (7, 24)>
