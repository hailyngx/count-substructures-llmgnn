Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-2-4-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-7-0-6
- Cycle 3: 6-1-3-7-6
- Cycle 4: 6-4-8-7-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 (6-9-2-4-6) has a chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 2 (6-9-7-0-6) has a chord: (9, 0)
- Cycle 3 (6-1-3-7-6) has a chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 4 (6-4-8-7-6) has a chord: (4, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (9, 4), 2, 4, 6)>
<2, (9, 0), 6, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 7), 3, 6, 7)>
<4, (4, 8), 6, 7, 8)>
