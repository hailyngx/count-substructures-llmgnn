Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 22) (9, 6) (9, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 27) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 17) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 4) (28, 21) (28, 20) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 19) (11, 17) (11, 25) (26, 14) (26, 20) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 12) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 24) (15, 16) (14, 6) (14, 26) (14, 1) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 23) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 17) (7, 3) (7, 29) (7, 22) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 12) (29, 7) (29, 19) (29, 23) (5, 15) (5, 25) (5, 0) (22, 6) (22, 7) (22, 0) (22, 20) (20, 28) (20, 26) (20, 22) (20, 10) (27, 13) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 23) (19, 3) (19, 29) (19, 25) (24, 15) (24, 27) (24, 23) (24, 25) (18, 15) (0, 5) (0, 22) (25, 11) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 24) (25, 16) (23, 3) (23, 4) (23, 29) (23, 27) (23, 24) (16, 15) (16, 25) (10, 20) 

Response:
Let's find all chordal 4-cycles in this graph:

<6, 9, 13, 27> has exactly one chord (6, 13).
<6, 14, 26, 20> has exactly one chord (14, 26).
<6, 17, 2, 12> has exactly one chord (6, 12).
<6, 22, 20, 10> has exactly one chord (6, 20).

Therefore, there are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph, so the final count is [4].
