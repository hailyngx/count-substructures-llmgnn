Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 6, 7, 1) with edges (1, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 9, 3, 1) with edges (1, 5), (5, 9), (9, 3), (3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1) with edges (1, 5), (5, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 4, 0, 1) with edges (1, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (0, 1)
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 8, 9, 5) with edges (5, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 5)
- Cycle 6: (6, 7, 8, 9, 6) with edges (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 6)
- Cycle 7: (3, 4, 0, 6, 3) with edges (3, 4), (4, 0), (0, 6), (6, 3)
- Cycle 8: (0, 4, 3, 9, 0) with edges (0, 4), (4, 3), (3, 9), (9, 0)
- Cycle 9: (0, 4, 3, 1, 0) with edges (0, 4), (4, 3), (3, 1), (1, 0)
- Cycle 10: (0, 6, 5, 9, 0) with edges (0, 6), (6, 5), (5, 9), (9, 0)
- Cycle 11: (0, 6, 7, 8, 0) with edges (0, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 0)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 3: <1, (5, 9), 8, 7> with chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 6: <6, (7, 8), 9, 6> with chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 11: <0, (6, 7), 8, 0> with chord (6, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
