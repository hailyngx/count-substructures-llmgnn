Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-2-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-9-3-1
- Cycle 3: 4-6-8-3-4
- Cycle 4: 0-5-2-4-0
- Cycle 5: 7-1-2-4-7
- Cycle 6: 7-3-4-6-7
- Cycle 7: 2-5-6-8-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (5, 2)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (1, 4), 2, 5>
<5, (3, 5), 9, 1>
<6, (6, 8), 3, 4>
<8, (2, 5), 6, 7>
