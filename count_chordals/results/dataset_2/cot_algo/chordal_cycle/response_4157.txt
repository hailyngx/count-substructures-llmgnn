Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 12) (10, 19) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 16) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 16) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 19) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 18) (2, 14) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 6) (6, 14) (6, 0) (15, 16) (15, 0) (17, 8) (17, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (11, 4, 18, 12)
- Cycle 2: (11, 4, 12, 10)
- Cycle 3: (11, 16, 3, 1)
- Cycle 4: (11, 16, 5, 13)
- Cycle 5: (11, 16, 15, 0)
- Cycle 6: (16, 3, 1, 19)
- Cycle 7: (16, 3, 14, 8)
- Cycle 8: (16, 5, 13, 5)
- Cycle 9: (16, 5, 7, 8)
- Cycle 10: (16, 15, 0, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 1, 19, 10)
- Cycle 12: (3, 14, 8, 6)
- Cycle 13: (4, 18, 0, 3)
- Cycle 14: (4, 12, 10, 19)
- Cycle 15: (18, 0, 3, 16)
- Cycle 16: (18, 0, 15, 16)
- Cycle 17: (5, 13, 16, 11)
- Cycle 18: (5, 7, 8, 19)
- Cycle 19: (13, 16, 11, 4)
- Cycle 20: (13, 5, 7, 8)
- Cycle 21: (10, 12, 4, 11)
- Cycle 22: (10, 19, 8, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 1 has a chord (4, 12)
2. Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 12)
3. Cycle 3 has a chord (3, 1)
4. Cycle 4 has a chord (5, 13)
5. Cycle 5 has a chord (15, 0)
6. Cycle 6 has a chord (3, 1)
7. Cycle 7 has a chord (14, 8)
8. Cycle 8 has a chord (5, 13)
9. Cycle 9 has a chord (7, 8)
10. Cycle 10 has a chord (15, 0)
11. Cycle 11 has a chord (19, 10)
12. Cycle 12 has a chord (8, 14)
13. Cycle 13 has a chord (18, 0)
14. Cycle 14 has a chord (10, 19)
15. Cycle 15 has a chord (0, 3)
16. Cycle 16 has a chord (0, 15)
17. Cycle 17 has a chord (11, 4)
18. Cycle 18 has a chord (7, 8)
19. Cycle 19 has a chord (13, 16)
20. Cycle 20 has a chord (5, 7)
21. Cycle 21 has a chord (10, 12)
22. Cycle 22 has a chord (8, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
