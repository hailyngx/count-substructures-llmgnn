Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 16) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 11) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 15) (13, 18) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 3) (0, 18) (0, 16) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 15) (6, 2) (6, 15) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 0) (14, 5) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4: 
  - (5, 4, 7, 11, 5)
  - (9, 11, 3, 10, 9)
  - (4, 12, 2, 6, 4)
  - (7, 11, 3, 10, 7)
  - (11, 18, 0, 16, 11)
  - (18, 0, 16, 1, 18)
  - (11, 7, 4, 12, 11)
  - (18, 13, 15, 6, 18)
  - (0, 18, 13, 15, 0)
  - (16, 1, 17, 8, 16)
  - (12, 17, 1, 16, 12)

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycles: 
  - <5, 7, 11, 4> with chord (7, 4)
  - <9, 3, 11, 10> with chord (9, 10)
  - <4, 2, 12, 6> with chord (4, 12)
  - <7, 3, 11, 10> with chord (7, 10)
  - <11, 0, 18, 16> with chord (11, 16)
  - <18, 0, 16, 1> with chord (18, 1)
  - <11, 4, 12, 7> with chord (11, 12)
  - <18, 6, 15, 13> with chord (18, 15)
  - <0, 13, 15, 18> with chord (0, 15)
  - <16, 8, 17, 1> with chord (16, 17)
  - <12, 1, 17, 16> with chord (12, 17)

Step 3:
- There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
- So, the final count is [11].
