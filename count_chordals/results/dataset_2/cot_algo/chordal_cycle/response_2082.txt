Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-8-3-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-0-4-6-5
- Cycle 3: 5-6-1-7-5
- Cycle 4: 5-7-2-1-6-5
- Cycle 5: 5-2-0-1-6-5
- Cycle 6: 5-3-6-4-0-5
- Cycle 7: 9-8-3-6-4-9
- Cycle 8: 9-0-4-1-7-9

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, (8, 3), 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, (0, 4), 6, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 6, (1, 7), 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 7, (2, 1), 6, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 2, (0, 1), 6, 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, 3, (6, 4), 0, 5>
- Cycle 7: <9, 8, (3, 6), 4, 9>
- Cycle 8: <9, 0, (4, 1), 7, 9>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [8] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
