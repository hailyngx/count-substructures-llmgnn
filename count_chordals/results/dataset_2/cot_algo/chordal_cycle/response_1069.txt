Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 1) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 8, 1, 4)
- Cycle 2: (5, 8, 2, 10)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 1, 13)
- Cycle 4: (6, 8, 2, 10)
- Cycle 5: (6, 8, 1, 13)
- Cycle 6: (6, 13, 4, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (8, 2)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (8, 1)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (8, 2)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (8, 1)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (13, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <5, 8, 1, 4>
2. <5, 8, 2, 10>
3. <5, 8, 1, 13>
4. <6, 8, 2, 10>
5. <6, 8, 1, 13>
6. <6, 13, 4, 1>
