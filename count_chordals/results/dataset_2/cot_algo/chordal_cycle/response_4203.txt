Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- (1, 9, 2, 5)
- (3, 7, 1, 9)
- (4, 9, 7, 8)
- (4, 2, 1, 9)
- (4, 8, 7, 5)
- (7, 1, 2, 9)
- (7, 5, 3, 0)
- (9, 1, 2, 5)

Step 2:
- Cycle (1, 9, 2, 5) has the chord (1, 2)
- Cycle (3, 7, 1, 9) has the chord (7, 9)
- Cycle (4, 9, 7, 8) has the chord (4, 7)
- Cycle (4, 2, 1, 9) has the chord (2, 9)
- Cycle (4, 8, 7, 5) has the chord (4, 7)
- Cycle (7, 1, 2, 9) has the chord (1, 9)
- Cycle (7, 5, 3, 0) has the chord (3, 5)
- Cycle (9, 1, 2, 5) has the chord (1, 2)

Step 3:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (1, 2), 9, 5>
- <3, 7, (7, 9), 1>
- <4, 9, (4, 7), 8>
- <4, (2, 9), 1, 9>
- <4, 8, (4, 7), 5>
- <7, (1, 9), 2, 9>
- <7, 5, 3, (3, 5)>
- <9, 1, (1, 2), 5>
