Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 0) (22, 11) (22, 17) (22, 8) (15, 20) (15, 17) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 24) (20, 10) (28, 29) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (29, 0) (29, 3) (24, 20) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 19) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 7) (4, 9) (27, 24) (27, 21) (27, 7) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 13) (0, 29) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 1) (10, 20) (10, 26) (10, 0) (10, 6) (6, 24) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 2) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 9) (18, 3) (3, 29) (3, 18) (3, 8) (17, 22) (17, 15) (17, 2) (23, 5) (23, 7) (21, 27) (21, 11) (25, 28) (25, 9) (14, 5) (14, 16) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 7) (19, 24) (19, 1) (7, 26) (7, 27) (7, 23) (7, 2) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 16) (16, 13) (16, 15) (16, 14) (16, 1) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 21) (8, 22) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (9, 4, 9)
- Cycle 2: (5, 14, 5)
- Cycle 3: (18, 5, 23, 7, 2, 17, 18)
- Cycle 4: (18, 9, 25, 28, 29, 8, 3, 18)
- Cycle 5: (22, 17, 2, 9, 4, 9, 18, 0, 29, 8, 22)
- Cycle 6: (22, 17, 2, 7, 23, 7, 27, 21, 11, 22)
- Cycle 7: (24, 20, 10, 0, 1, 19, 24)
- Cycle 8: (24, 20, 10, 6, 8, 3, 29, 0, 13, 16, 24)
- Cycle 9: (24, 20, 15, 17, 2, 9, 4, 9, 25, 28, 29, 0, 13, 16, 24)
- Cycle 10: (24, 26, 7, 2, 9, 4, 9, 25, 28, 29, 0, 10, 6, 24)
- Cycle 11: (27, 24, 20, 15, 17, 2, 10, 0, 1, 16, 27)
- Cycle 12: (27, 24, 26, 7, 23, 5, 18, 3, 29, 0, 13, 16, 27)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (27, 21), 11, 22)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (9, 18), 5, 23)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (8, 29), 0, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (4, 9), 25, 28)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (24, 26), 7, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (7, 27), 24, 20)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found. 
There are a total of [6] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
