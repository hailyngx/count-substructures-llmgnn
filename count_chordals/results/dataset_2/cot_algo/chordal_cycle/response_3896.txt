Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 18) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 6) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (9, 10) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 11) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 0) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 11) (14, 16) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 16) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 12) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 0) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-1-15-4
- Cycle 2: 4-11-13-17-4
- Cycle 3: 4-2-8-16-4
- Cycle 4: 1-3-18-9-1
- Cycle 5: 1-15-10-19-1
- Cycle 6: 3-12-16-8-3
- Cycle 7: 10-15-1-7-10
- Cycle 8: 18-9-10-19-18
- Cycle 9: 18-3-1-7-18
- Cycle 10: 11-13-17-4-11
- Cycle 11: 11-18-3-5-11
- Cycle 12: 11-14-16-8-11
- Cycle 13: 11-5-3-1-11
- Cycle 14: 6-8-16-12-6
- Cycle 15: 6-15-10-19-6
- Cycle 16: 6-0-15-1-6
- Cycle 17: 0-19-10-9-0
- Cycle 18: 0-6-15-1-0

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (7, 15), 4>
- Cycle 2: <13, (4, 17), 11>
- Cycle 3: <8, (2, 16), 4>
- Cycle 4: <3, (1, 18), 9>
- Cycle 5: <1, (10, 15), 19>
- Cycle 6: <12, (3, 16), 18>
- Cycle 7: <15, (1, 10), 7>
- Cycle 8: <9, (10, 19), 18>
- Cycle 9: <18, (1, 7), 3>
- Cycle 10: <17, (4, 13), 11>
- Cycle 11: <5, (3, 11), 18>
- Cycle 12: <14, (8, 16), 11>
- Cycle 13: <11, (1, 3), 5>
- Cycle 14: <16, (6, 12), 8>
- Cycle 15: <19, (10, 15), 6>
- Cycle 16: <0, (1, 15), 6>
- Cycle 17: <0, (9, 19), 10>
- Cycle 18: <6, (15, 0), 1>

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [18]
