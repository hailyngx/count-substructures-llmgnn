Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 25, 21, 13> has a chord (21, 13).
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 10, 11, 5> has a chord (10, 11).
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 10, 11, 6> has a chord (10, 11).
- Chordal 4-cycle <10, 11, 5, 6> has a chord (11, 5).
- Chordal 4-cycle <17, 10, 11, 5> has a chord (10, 11).
- Chordal 4-cycle <17, 10, 11, 6> has a chord (10, 11).
- Chordal 4-cycle <18, 22, 16, 24> has a chord (22, 16).
- Chordal 4-cycle <18, 28, 21, 25> has a chord (28, 21).
- Chordal 4-cycle <27, 28, 18, 22> has a chord (28, 18).
- Chordal 4-cycle <26, 20, 15, 4> has a chord (20, 15).
- Chordal 4-cycle <12, 2, 3, 25> has a chord (3, 25).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are 33 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [33].
