Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-8-5-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-2-5-6
- Cycle 3: 6-2-5-0-6
- Cycle 4: 9-8-5-7-9
- Cycle 5: 9-2-5-8-9
- Cycle 6: 1-3-7-4-1

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <6, (9, 8), 5>
- Cycle 2: <6, (9, 2), 5>
- Cycle 3: <6, (2, 5), 0>
- Cycle 4: <9, (8, 5), 7>
- Cycle 5: <9, (2, 8), 5>
- Cycle 6: <1, (3, 7), 4>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<6, (9, 8), 5>
<6, (9, 2), 5>
<6, (2, 5), 0>
<9, (8, 5), 7>
<9, (2, 8), 5>
<1, (3, 7), 4>
