Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 12) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-6-10-0-5
- Cycle 2: 5-7-8-11-10-5
- Cycle 3: 5-14-9-7-5
- Cycle 4: 9-14-5-6-10-9
- Cycle 5: 9-3-0-10-11-9
- Cycle 6: 10-11-8-7-9-10
- Cycle 7: 10-0-6-13-3-10
- Cycle 8: 10-1-4-12-0-10
- Cycle 9: 10-4-2-1-10

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4: 9-14-5-6-10-9 has a chord 6-9
- Cycle 6: 10-11-8-7-9-10 has a chord 7-11

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [7]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<1, (5, 14), 9)>
<2, (7, 8), 11)>
