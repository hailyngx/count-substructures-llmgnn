Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 5 - 1 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 3 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 8 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 4: 9 - 4 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 5: 9 - 7 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 0 - 7 - 9
- Cycle 7: 4 - 8 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 8: 4 - 2 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 9: 7 - 0 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 10: 1 - 3 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 11: 1 - 0 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 12: 3 - 9 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 13: 3 - 5 - 1 - 3
- Cycle 14: 8 - 4 - 9 - 8
- Cycle 15: 8 - 2 - 6 - 8
- Cycle 16: 6 - 4 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 17: 6 - 8 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 18: 2 - 7 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 19: 2 - 6 - 8 - 2
- Cycle 20: 0 - 9 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 21: 0 - 1 - 5 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <5, 1, 3, 5> has one chord (5, 3)
- <5, 3, 9, 5> has one chord (5, 9)
- <5, 8, 4, 5> has one chord (5, 4)
- <9, 4, 6, 9> has one chord (9, 6)
- <9, 7, 3, 9> has one chord (9, 3)
- <9, 0, 7, 9> has one chord (9, 7)
- <4, 8, 6, 4> has one chord (4, 6)
- <4, 2, 7, 4> has one chord (4, 7)
- <7, 0, 1, 7> has one chord (7, 1)
- <1, 3, 7, 1> has one chord (1, 7)
- <1, 0, 9, 1> has one chord (1, 9)
- <3, 9, 7, 3> has one chord (3, 7)
- <3, 5, 1, 3> has one chord (3, 1)
- <8, 4, 9, 8> has one chord (8, 9)
- <8, 2, 6, 8> has one chord (8, 6)
- <6, 4, 2, 6> has one chord (6, 2)
- <6, 8, 2, 6> has one chord (6, 2)
- <2, 7, 4, 2> has one chord (2, 4)
- <2, 6, 8, 2> has one chord (2, 8)
- <0, 9, 7, 0> has one chord (0, 7)
- <0, 1, 5, 0> has one chord (0, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 21 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [21].
