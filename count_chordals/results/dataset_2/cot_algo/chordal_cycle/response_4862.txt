Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: 1-6-8-4-9-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-8-0-9-1
- Cycle 3: 1-9-4-8-6-1
- Cycle 4: 2-1-6-8-4-2
- Cycle 5: 2-3-7-4-8-2
- Cycle 6: 2-5-7-4-8-2
- Cycle 7: 2-0-6-1-9-2
- Cycle 8: 3-7-4-8-6-3
- Cycle 9: 4-7-8-6-1-4
- Cycle 10: 4-8-6-1-9-4
- Cycle 11: 4-5-7-3-9-4
- Cycle 12: 5-7-3-9-0-5
- Cycle 13: 6-1-9-3-7-6
- Cycle 14: 6-8-4-7-3-6
- Cycle 15: 7-4-8-6-1-7
- Cycle 16: 8-4-7-3-6-8
- Cycle 17: 9-4-8-6-1-9
- Cycle 18: 0-6-1-9-3-0

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 9: 4-7-8-6-1-4 has exactly one chord (7, 6) <4, (7, 6), 1>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [17]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <4, (7, 6), 1>
