Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 12, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 10, 13, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 3, 2, 12, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 3, 5, 14, 1, 12, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 12, 2, 6, 7, 1, 14, 5, 3, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 12, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 14, 0>
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 10, 13, 8, 6, 2, 12, 0, 3, 5, 14, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 3, 5, 14, 11, 6, 7, 1> 
- Cycle 9: <2, 3, 5, 14, 11, 6, 7, 1, 12, 2>
- Cycle 10: <3, 4, 10, 13, 9, 2, 6, 8, 13, 0>
- Cycle 11: <3, 5, 14, 11, 6, 2, 12, 3>
- Cycle 12: <4, 1, 7, 6, 2, 12, 0>
- Cycle 13: <4, 3, 2, 6, 7, 1>
- Cycle 14: <4, 10, 13, 8, 6, 7, 1>
- Cycle 15: <5, 3, 4, 1, 14, 11, 6, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 1, 12, 0> has a chord <4, 12>
- <0, 4, 10, 13, 0> has a chord <4, 13>
- <0, 4, 3, 5, 14, 1, 12, 0> has a chord <5, 12>
- <0, 12, 2, 6, 7, 1, 14, 5, 3, 0> has a chord <2, 7>
- <1, 4, 10, 13, 8, 6, 2, 12, 0, 3, 5, 14, 1> has a chord <10, 8>
- <3, 5, 14, 11, 6, 2, 12, 3> has a chord <5, 12>
- <4, 1, 7, 6, 2, 12, 0> has a chord <1, 6>
- <3, 4, 10, 13, 9, 2, 6, 8, 13, 0> has a chord <4, 8>
- <5, 3, 4, 1, 14, 11, 6, 2> has a chord <3, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [9] unique chordal 4-cycles found:

<0, 4, 1, 12, 0>
<0, 4, 10, 13, 0>
<0, 4, 3, 5, 14, 1, 12, 0>
<0, 12, 2, 6, 7, 1, 14, 5, 3, 0>
<1, 4, 10, 13, 8, 6, 2, 12, 0, 3, 5, 14, 1>
<3, 5, 14, 11, 6, 2, 12, 3>
<4, 1, 7, 6, 2, 12, 0>
<3, 4, 10, 13, 9, 2, 6, 8, 13, 0>
<5, 3, 4, 1, 14, 11, 6, 2>
