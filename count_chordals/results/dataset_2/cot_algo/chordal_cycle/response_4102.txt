Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 3) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 11) (26, 27) (2, 7) (18, 6) (18, 1) (18, 8) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 25) (12, 0) (29, 17) (29, 24) (29, 3) (21, 10) (21, 8) (21, 17) (17, 29) (17, 21) (17, 25) (17, 27) (3, 9) (3, 29) (3, 13) (3, 19) (11, 26) (11, 19) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 20) (4, 6) (27, 26) (27, 17) (27, 4) (27, 25) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 15) (10, 5) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 16) (25, 12) (25, 17) (25, 27) (1, 18) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 1) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 23) (16, 19) (24, 29) (24, 4) (24, 8) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 23) (5, 0) (23, 16) (23, 5) (23, 20) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 0) (8, 18) (8, 21) (8, 24) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 14) (20, 4) (20, 23) (20, 14) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 20) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 19) 

Response:
Following the steps mentioned earlier, let's identify the chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- From node 9 to node 26 to node 11 to node 19 to node 0 back to node 9: (9, 26, 11, 19, 0, 9)
- Many other cycles also exist in the graph.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle (9, 26, 11, 19, 0, 9) has a chord between nodes 11 and 0.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- As we found at least one chord in the cycles, there are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <<9, 26, 11, 19>, (0, 9)>>
