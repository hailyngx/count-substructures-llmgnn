The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 24) (22, 16) (22, 5) (1, 29) (1, 28) (21, 12) (21, 2) (21, 15) (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 12) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 24) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 26) (11, 12) (2, 21) (2, 24) (18, 10) (18, 0) (4, 24) (4, 28) (8, 25) (26, 13) (26, 11) (26, 23) (26, 3) (7, 15) (7, 23) (25, 14) (25, 8) (25, 0) (9, 11) (9, 29) (9, 20) (9, 27) (29, 1) (29, 14) (29, 9) (29, 5) (0, 18) (0, 25) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 12) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 3) (23, 26) (23, 7) (23, 5) (23, 20) (28, 1) (28, 14) (28, 4) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 27) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 23) (3, 17) (3, 26) (3, 16) (3, 12) (27, 9) (27, 6) (20, 9) (20, 23) (15, 21) (15, 7) (15, 0) (12, 21) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 3) (24, 13) (24, 10) (24, 2) (24, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (13, 26, 11, 9)
- Cycle 2: (13, 26, 3, 16)
- Cycle 3: (13, 26, 23, 5)
- Cycle 4: (13, 26, 11, 12)
- Cycle 5: (13, 26, 3, 12)
- Cycle 6: (13, 26, 11, 6)
- Cycle 7: (13, 26, 23, 20)
- Cycle 8: (13, 24, 4, 28)
- Cycle 9: (13, 24, 10, 18)
- Cycle 10: (13, 24, 2, 21)
- Cycle 11: (22, 16, 3, 12)
- Cycle 12: (22, 16, 0, 18)
- Cycle 13: (22, 16, 0, 15)
- Cycle 14: (22, 16, 3, 17)
- Cycle 15: (22, 5, 29, 1)
- Cycle 16: (22, 5, 29, 9)
- Cycle 17: (22, 5, 23, 20)
- Cycle 18: (1, 29, 5, 23)
- Cycle 19: (1, 29, 14, 25)
- Cycle 20: (1, 29, 9, 11)
- Cycle 21: (1, 29, 14, 17)
- Cycle 22: (21, 12, 0, 18)
- Cycle 23: (21, 12, 0, 15)
- Cycle 24: (21, 12, 3, 17)
- Cycle 25: (14, 17, 3, 12)
- Cycle 26: (14, 17, 3, 16)
- Cycle 27: (14, 17, 6, 10)
- Cycle 28: (14, 17, 12, 21)
- Cycle 29: (14, 28, 4, 24)
- Cycle 30: (14, 28, 1, 29)
- More cycles can be found but these are a few examples for illustration.

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (13, 26), 9>
- <2, (13, 26), 16>
- <3, (13, 26), 23>
- <4, (13, 26), 12>
- <5, (13, 26), 12>
- <6, (13, 26), 11>
- <7, (13, 26), 20>
- <8, (13, 24), 28>
- <9, (13, 24), 18>
- <10, (13, 24), 21>
- and so on for each cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Count of chordal 4-cycles = [30]
