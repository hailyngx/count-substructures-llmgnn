Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 9) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4: (4, 6, 5, 7), (7, 2, 8, 5), (5, 8, 9, 11), (11, 9, 14, 4), (4, 14, 9, 1), (1, 9, 8, 2), (2, 1, 0, 10), (10, 0, 8, 2), (2, 7, 3, 11), (11, 3, 6, 13), (13, 6, 5, 8), (8, 5, 7, 3), (3, 7, 12, 0), (0, 12, 4, 6), (6, 4, 14, 9)

Step 2: 
- Checking for chords in each cycle:
  - In cycle (4, 6, 5, 7), the chord is (4, 5).
  - In cycle (7, 2, 8, 5), the chord is (7, 8).
  - In cycle (5, 8, 9, 11), the chord is (5, 9).
  - In cycle (11, 9, 14, 4), the chord is (11, 14).
  - In cycle (4, 14, 9, 1), the chord is (4, 9).
  - In cycle (1, 9, 8, 2), the chord is (1, 8).
  - In cycle (2, 1, 0, 10), the chord is (2, 0).
  - In cycle (10, 0, 8, 2), the chord is (10, 8).
  - In cycle (2, 7, 3, 11), the chord is (2, 3).
  - In cycle (11, 3, 6, 13), the chord is (11, 6).
  - In cycle (13, 6, 5, 8), the chord is (13, 5).
  - In cycle (8, 5, 7, 3), the chord is (8, 7).
  - In cycle (3, 7, 12, 0), the chord is (3, 12).
  - In cycle (0, 12, 4, 6), the chord is (0, 4).
  - In cycle (6, 4, 14, 9), the chord is (6, 14).

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [15]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <4, (4, 5), 6, 7>
- <7, (7, 8), 2, 5>
- <5, (5, 9), 8, 11>
- <11, (11, 14), 9, 4>
- <4, (4, 9), 14, 1>
- <1, (1, 8), 9, 2>
- <2, (2, 0), 1, 10>
- <10, (10, 8), 0, 2>
- <2, (2, 3), 7, 11>
- <11, (11, 6), 3, 13>
- <13, (13, 5), 6, 8>
- <8, (8, 7), 5, 3>
- <3, (3, 12), 7, 0>
- <0, (0, 4), 12, 6>
- <6, (6, 14), 4, 9>
