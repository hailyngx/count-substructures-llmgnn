Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 22) (7, 21) (7, 10) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 15) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 0) (23, 3) (23, 0) (23, 20) (2, 8) (2, 10) (19, 29) (19, 17) (19, 28) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 27) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 24) (4, 20) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 13) (13, 26) (13, 18) (13, 25) (13, 3) (13, 6) (22, 16) (22, 4) (22, 14) (6, 13) (6, 24) (6, 20) (24, 4) (24, 6) (24, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 12) (3, 23) (3, 13) (17, 19) (17, 0) (17, 5) (14, 22) (29, 8) (29, 19) (29, 5) (25, 13) (25, 12) (27, 26) (27, 18) (27, 1) (0, 8) (0, 23) (0, 17) (1, 27) (1, 9) (1, 12) (9, 7) (9, 24) (9, 1) (28, 19) (28, 5) (28, 15) (12, 11) (12, 21) (12, 10) (12, 25) (12, 1) (5, 17) (5, 29) (5, 28) (15, 21) (15, 28) (20, 23) (20, 4) (20, 18) (20, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 22, 14)
- Cycle 2: (7, 21, 12, 25)
- Cycle 3: (7, 21, 15, 28)
- Cycle 4: (8, 2, 10, 26)
- Cycle 5: (23, 3, 13, 6)
- Cycle 6: (23, 20, 4, 24)
- Cycle 7: (18, 27, 1, 9)
- Cycle 8: (19, 29, 5, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has a chord (16, 4): <1, (16, 4), 2>
- Cycle 2 has a chord (21, 12): <2, (21, 12), 2>
- Cycle 4 has a chord (2, 26): <4, (2, 26), 2>
- Cycle 5 has a chord (3, 13): <5, (3, 13), 2>
- Cycle 6 has a chord (20, 4): <6, (20, 4), 2>
- Cycle 7 has a chord (27, 1): <7, (27, 1), 2>
- Cycle 8 has a chord (29, 5): <8, (29, 5), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
