Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 6) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 6) (2, 12) (2, 19) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 1) (18, 4) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 18) (3, 17) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 4) (15, 8) (15, 10) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 7) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 6) (9, 16) (7, 10) (7, 13) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 5) (5, 8) (5, 17) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 13) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 1-11-3-18-4-1
        - Cycle 2: 4-1-8-15-10-4
        - Cycle 3: 4-10-7-13-16-12-4
        - Cycle 4: 6-12-16-13-7-6
        - Cycle 5: 6-16-9-11-3-17-6
        - Cycle 6: 12-16-9-11-3-17-12

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Checking cycle 1: (4, 18) is a chord. Hence, <1, (4, 18), 3>
        - Checking cycle 2: (8, 15) is a chord. Hence, <2, (8, 15), 10>
        - Checking cycle 3: (13, 16) is a chord. Hence, <3, (13, 16), 7>
        - Checking cycle 4: (6, 13) is a chord. Hence, <4, (6, 13), 7>
        - Checking cycle 5: (6, 16) is a chord. Hence, <5, (6, 16), 9>
        - Checking cycle 6: (12, 16) is a chord. Hence, <6, (12, 16), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [6]
