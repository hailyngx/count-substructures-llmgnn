Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 8, 9)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 7, 2)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 5, 8)
- Cycle 4: (0, 6, 4, 9)
- Cycle 5: (0, 3, 9, 8)
- Cycle 6: (1, 7, 3, 6)
- Cycle 7: (1, 7, 2, 8)
- Cycle 8: (1, 8, 2, 0)
- Cycle 9: (2, 7, 3, 9)
- Cycle 10: (2, 8, 5, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, 8, 9> with chord (1, 8).
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, 7, 2> with chord (1, 7).
- Cycle 3 is a chordal 4-cycle <0, 6, 5, 8> with chord (6, 5).
- Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle <0, 6, 4, 9> with chord (6, 4).
- Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle <0, 3, 9, 8> with chord (3, 8).
- Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle <1, 7, 3, 6> with chord (7, 3).
- Cycle 7 is a chordal 4-cycle <1, 7, 2, 8> with chord (7, 2).
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle <1, 8, 2, 0> with chord (8, 2).
- Cycle 9 is a chordal 4-cycle <2, 7, 3, 9> with chord (7, 3).
- Cycle 10 is a chordal 4-cycle <2, 8, 5, 6> with chord (8, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [10].
