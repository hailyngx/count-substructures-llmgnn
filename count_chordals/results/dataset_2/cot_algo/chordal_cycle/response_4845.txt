Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 1 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 4 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 8 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 5: 1 - 3 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 5 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 7: 3 - 2 - 9 - 3
- Cycle 8: 3 - 4 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 9: 4 - 7 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 10: 7 - 9 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 11: 8 - 3 - 2 - 8
- Cycle 12: 5 - 2 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 13: 2 - 5 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 14: 0 - 1 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 15: 0 - 3 - 4 - 0

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the cycle 6 - 1 - 3 - 6 has exactly one chord: (1, 3). Therefore, we have found one chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 15 - 1 = 14.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <6, 1, 3, 6>.
