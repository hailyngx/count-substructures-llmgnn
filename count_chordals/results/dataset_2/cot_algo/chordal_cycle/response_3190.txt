Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1 - 5 - 4 - 9 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 5 - 6 - 3 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 5 - 2 - 9 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 6 - 8 - 9 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 6 - 3 - 4 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 6 - 3 - 2 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 8 - 9 - 4 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 8: 1 - 8 - 6 - 5 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 9: 1 - 8 - 7 - 0 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 10: 1 - 8 - 0 - 2 - 5 - 1

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has no chord.
- Cycle 8 has no chord.
- Cycle 9 has no chord.
- Cycle 10 has no chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 10

Therefore, the final count of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 5, 6, 3, 4>
<1, 8, 0, 2, 5>
