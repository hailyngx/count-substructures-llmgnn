Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 12) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 1) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 12) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 9 - 13 - 12 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 14 - 11 - 1
- Cycle 3: 2 - 13 - 8 - 2
- Cycle 4: 3 - 4 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 5: 3 - 4 - 14 - 1 - 3
- Cycle 6: 5 - 6 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 7: 5 - 6 - 3 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 8: 5 - 11 - 14 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 9: 6 - 3 - 4 - 14 - 6
- Cycle 10: 9 - 13 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 11: 9 - 12 - 0 - 9
- Cycle 12: 10 - 9 - 0 - 10
- Cycle 13: 10 - 13 - 8 - 3 - 10
- Cycle 14: 11 - 14 - 4 - 3 - 11
- Cycle 15: 12 - 0 - 4 - 3 - 12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <9, 12, 13, 0>
- <11, 1, 14, 5>
- <2, 8, 13, 7>
- <4, 14, 1, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
