Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <6, 9, 11, 1>. 

Since there is exactly one chord in this cycle (edge (9, 1)), the number of chordless cycles in the graph is [1].
