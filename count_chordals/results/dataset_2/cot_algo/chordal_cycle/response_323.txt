Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 26) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (0, 10) (0, 21) (0, 29) (27, 26) (27, 13) (1, 14) (1, 13) (22, 20) (22, 21) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 24) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 29) (5, 17) (9, 15) (9, 5) (12, 4) (12, 21) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 2) (18, 29) (20, 22) (20, 19) (6, 3) (6, 10) (28, 7) (28, 25) (4, 11) (4, 12) (19, 5) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 13) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 25) (8, 17) (10, 0) (10, 23) (10, 6) (10, 7) (14, 1) (24, 23) (24, 17) (24, 25) (21, 0) (21, 22) (21, 12) (13, 3) (13, 27) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 25) (25, 28) (25, 8) (25, 24) (25, 13) (25, 29) (17, 15) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 24) (7, 23) (7, 2) (7, 28) (7, 10) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 18) (29, 25) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 27) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique chordal 4-cycle:

<1, (26, 13), 4>

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
