Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
(5, 9, 6, 5)
(5, 9, 0, 5)
(5, 9, 7, 5)
(5, 6, 9, 5)
(9, 5, 0, 9)
(9, 5, 7, 9)
(6, 9, 7, 6)
(6, 9, 5, 6)
(6, 5, 2, 6)
(6, 5, 9, 6)
(1, 3, 6, 1)
(1, 3, 4, 1)
(1, 3, 7, 1)
(1, 7, 8, 1)
(3, 1, 4, 3)
(3, 1, 7, 3)
(3, 4, 8, 3)
(4, 3, 8, 4)
(4, 3, 1, 4)
(4, 8, 0, 4)
(8, 1, 7, 8)
(8, 1, 4, 8)
(8, 4, 0, 8)
(8, 4, 3, 8)
(0, 9, 5, 0)
(0, 9, 4, 0)
(0, 9, 7, 0)
(0, 4, 8, 0)
(0, 4, 3, 0)
(0, 8, 7, 0)
(7, 9, 5, 7)
(7, 9, 0, 7)
(7, 9, 1, 7)
(7, 0, 8, 7)
(7, 0, 2, 7)
(2, 5, 0, 2)
(2, 5, 6, 2)
(2, 0, 4, 2)
(2, 0, 7, 2)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<5, 9, 6, 5> with (5, 6) as the chord
<5, 9, 0, 5> with (0, 9) as the chord
<5, 9, 7, 5> with (7, 9) as the chord
<6, 5, 2, 6> with (6, 2) as the chord
<1, 3, 6, 1> with (1, 6) as the chord
<1, 3, 4, 1> with (1, 4) as the chord
<3, 4, 8, 3> with (3, 8) as the chord
<4, 8, 0, 4> with (4, 0) as the chord
<0, 9, 5, 0> with (0, 5) as the chord
<7, 9, 0, 7> with (7, 0) as the chord
<2, 5, 0, 2> with (2, 0) as the chord

Step 3:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the count is [11].
