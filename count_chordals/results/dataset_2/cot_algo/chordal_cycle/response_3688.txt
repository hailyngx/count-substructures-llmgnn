Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 10) (2, 0) (2, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 17) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 7) (19, 4) (19, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (6, 18) (16, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 4) (7, 13) (7, 18) 

Response:
Step 1:  
There are several cycles in the graph of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-8-15
- Cycle 2: 0-3-9-1
- Cycle 3: 0-10-9-1
- Cycle 4: 2-0-3-9
- Cycle 5: 5-13-15-8
- Cycle 6: 5-13-7-18
- Cycle 7: 5-12-8-15
- Cycle 8: 5-17-1-4
- Cycle 9: 17-1-9-3
- Cycle 10: 17-15-13-5
- Cycle 11: 17-16-11-14
- Cycle 12: 17-11-4-1
- Cycle 13: 17-5-12-11
- Cycle 14: 17-15-8-12
- Cycle 15: 18-7-13-5
- Cycle 16: 18-11-4-9
- Cycle 17: 18-6-7-13
- Cycle 18: 18-11-14-12

Step 2:  
Only the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3: 0-10-9-1 (chord: 9-1)
- Cycle 8: 5-17-1-4 (chord: 17-4)

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles gives us [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, (9, 1), 10>  
<5, (17, 4), 1>
