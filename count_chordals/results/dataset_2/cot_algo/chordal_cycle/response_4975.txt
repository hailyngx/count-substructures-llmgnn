Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (19, 16) (19, 2) (15, 8) (15, 14) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (3, 0) (17, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 18) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 8) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph. However, we will focus on the cycles of length 4 only for the purpose of finding chordal 4-cycles.

1. (1, 6, 9, 2, 1)
2. (1, 5, 2, 9, 1)
3. (1, 5, 4, 11, 10, 1)
4. (1, 5, 4, 17, 4, 1)
5. (1, 9, 13, 2, 1)
6. (1, 14, 8, 7, 11, 4, 1)
7. (2, 9, 1, 6, 9, 2)
8. (2, 9, 13, 2, 12, 0, 3, 0, 2)
9. (4, 17, 4, 11, 10, 4)
10. (7, 8, 14, 1, 5, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

After checking each cycle, we find that the following cycle has exactly one chord:

- (1, 5, 4, 11, 10, 1) with one chord (11, 4) 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there is only one chordal 4-cycle in the given graph, the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 5, 4, 11> with chord (11, 4)
