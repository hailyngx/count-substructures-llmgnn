Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 7, 9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 5, 8, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 7, 4, 9, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 4, 7, 3)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 6: (7, 9, 2, 7)
- Cycle 7: (9, 3, 7, 4, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (2, 9)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 6 has zero chords.
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (3, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 1 chordless cycle found. 

Therefore, the final count is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (5, 8), 6)> with the chord (5, 8) inside the angle brackets.
