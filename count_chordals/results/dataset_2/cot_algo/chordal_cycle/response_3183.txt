Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 20) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 6) (15, 27) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 28) (27, 19) (27, 23) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 4) (6, 13) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 24) (12, 7) (11, 15) (11, 28) (11, 1) (28, 27) (28, 11) (28, 14) (17, 15) (20, 9) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 5) (5, 20) (5, 19) (5, 22) (5, 0) (19, 27) (19, 5) (19, 0) (25, 15) (25, 21) (1, 11) (1, 29) (29, 1) (29, 21) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 3) (0, 8) (3, 26) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 10) (13, 6) (13, 20) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 29) (14, 18) (14, 28) (14, 22) (14, 23) (22, 5) (22, 14) (22, 10) (22, 8) (24, 7) (24, 3) (24, 8) (8, 20) (8, 0) (8, 22) (8, 24) (10, 18) (10, 3) (10, 22) (16, 18) (16, 23) (16, 4) (4, 6) (4, 16) (23, 27) (23, 14) (23, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (9, 6, 26, 21, 9)
- Cycle 2: (15, 27, 19, 5, 15)
- Cycle 3: (15, 27, 23, 14, 15)
- Cycle 4: (15, 17, 15, 25, 21)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (15, 23), 14)>
- <2, (21, 25), 15)>
- <3, (15, 21), 27)>
- <4, (9, 26), 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There were 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [4].
