Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 19) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 19) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 17) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 3) (0, 19) (12, 4) (12, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (18, 9) (18, 5) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (8, 7) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 10) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 0) (15, 5) (15, 17) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-11-16-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-3-17-1

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. Checking Cycle 1: 1-11-16-4-1
   - Possible chord: (11, 4)

2. Checking Cycle 2: 1-6-3-17-1
   - Possible chord: (6, 17)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <1, 11, 4, 16> with chord (11, 4)
2. <1, 6, 3, 17> with chord (6, 17)
