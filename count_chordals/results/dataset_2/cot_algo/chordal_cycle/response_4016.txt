Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-2-6-5
- Cycle 3: 5-7-4-8-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-4-7-5
- Cycle 5: 4-9-2-6-4
- Cycle 6: 4-7-5-1-4
- Cycle 7: 4-8-2-9-4
- Cycle 8: 7-5-1-4-7
- Cycle 9: 8-4-7-5-8
- Cycle 10: 2-9-5-1-2
- Cycle 11: 2-6-5-9-2
- Cycle 12: 8-2-9-5-8

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the following have exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <5, (9, 1), 4>
- Cycle 2: <5, (9, 6), 2>
- Cycle 3: <5, (7, 8), 4>
- Cycle 4: <5, (1, 4), 7>
- Cycle 5: <4, (9, 6), 2>
- Cycle 6: <4, (7, 1), 5>
- Cycle 7: <4, (2, 9), 6>
- Cycle 8: <7, (1, 4), 5>
- Cycle 9: <8, (4, 7), 5>
- Cycle 10: <2, (9, 1), 5>
- Cycle 11: <2, (6, 9), 5>
- Cycle 12: <8, (2, 9), 5>

Step 3:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [12].
