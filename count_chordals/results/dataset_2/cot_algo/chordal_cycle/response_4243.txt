Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0-1-3-5-0
- Cycle 2: 1-2-4-5-1
- Cycle 3: 1-2-5-3-1
- Cycle 4: 1-7-0-2-1
- Cycle 5: 3-1-7-0-3
- Cycle 6: 3-1-8-5-3
- Cycle 7: 4-2-1-8-4
- Cycle 8: 4-2-6-7-4
- Cycle 9: 4-5-3-1-4
- Cycle 10: 5-2-4-6-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 1-5
- Cycle 2 has a chord 2-4
- Cycle 3 has a chord 2-5
- Cycle 4 has a chord 0-2
- Cycle 5 has a chord 1-7
- Cycle 6 has a chord 1-8
- Cycle 7 has a chord 1-8
- Cycle 8 has a chord 2-7
- Cycle 9 has a chord 1-4
- Cycle 10 has a chord 2-6

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
