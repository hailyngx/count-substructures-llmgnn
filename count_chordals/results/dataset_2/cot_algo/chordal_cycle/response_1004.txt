Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (4, 0) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 14) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 10) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 2) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 7, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 13, 7, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 7, 2, 14, 8, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 7, 13, 4, 0, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 8, 5, 4, 0, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 11, 1, 0, 6)
- Cycle 7: (9, 7, 2, 14, 8, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 7, 13, 4, 0, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 3, 8, 5, 4, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 13, 4, 11, 6, 9)
- Cycle 11: (0, 4, 5, 8, 6, 0)
- Cycle 12: (0, 4, 13, 7, 9, 0)
- Cycle 13: (0, 1, 11, 6, 9, 0)
- Cycle 14: (7, 2, 3, 10, 12, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 13, 4, 11, 5, 7)
- Cycle 16: (8, 5, 4, 11, 6, 8)
- Cycle 17: (4, 11, 1, 0, 4)
- Cycle 18: (4, 13, 7, 9, 4)
- Cycle 19: (4, 5, 8, 6, 4)
- Cycle 20: (12, 10, 3, 2, 14, 12)
- Cycle 21: (12, 14, 1, 0, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The chordal 4-cycles are:
<7, (9, 13), 4, 0)>
<(3, 8), 5, 4, 9>
<4, (11, 1), 0, 6>
<3, (2, 14), 12, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 21 cycles.
- There are 4 chordal 4-cycles.
- So, there are [17] chordless 4-cycles in the graph.
