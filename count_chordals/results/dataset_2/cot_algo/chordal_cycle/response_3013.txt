Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 27) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 29) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 28) (0, 5) (14, 13) (14, 25) (26, 21) (26, 6) (26, 8) (28, 3) (28, 0) (28, 9) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 24) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 27) (13, 6) (7, 24) (7, 27) (25, 14) (25, 21) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 29) (8, 27) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 12) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 6) (22, 19) (22, 17) (22, 21) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 6) (29, 3) (29, 8) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 4) (17, 3) (17, 22) (17, 24) (16, 18) (24, 5) (24, 7) (24, 17) (24, 18) (18, 16) (18, 24) (18, 23) (18, 27) (23, 15) (23, 18) (23, 21) (23, 20) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 28) (20, 8) (20, 23) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 22) (21, 23) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 7) (27, 8) (27, 18) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 15) (6, 26) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (2, 5, 0, 28, 3)
- (2, 5, 0, 28, 9)
- (2, 5, 13, 14, 25)
- (2, 6, 26, 21, 25)
- (2, 6, 26, 21, 23)
- (2, 6, 12, 11, 9)
- (2, 6, 12, 11, 19)
- (2, 6, 13, 14, 25)
- (2, 10, 4, 13, 14)
- (2, 10, 4, 13, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <2, 5, 0, 28, 3> has chord (5, 28)
- <2, 5, 0, 28, 9> has chord (0, 9)
- <2, 5, 13, 14, 25> has chord (13, 25)
- <2, 6, 12, 11, 9> has chord (12, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Since there are no chordless cycles found, the final count is [0].
