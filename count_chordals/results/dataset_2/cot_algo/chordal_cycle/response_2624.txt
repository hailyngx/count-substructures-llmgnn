    - Cycle 20: <6, 2, 3, 1>
    - Cycle 21: <6, 14, 15, 10>
    - Cycle 22: <6, 14, 16, 17>
    - Cycle 23: <9, 13, 0, 17>
    - Cycle 24: <13, 0, 17, 1>
    
Step 2:
    - Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
        - <1, 3, 10, 15> (1, 10)
        - <3, 10, 7, 15> (10, 7)
        - <3, 10, 2, 6> (10, 2)
        - <10, 15, 11, 5> (15, 11)
        - <15, 14, 16, 17> (14, 16)
        - <11, 8, 18, 0> (8, 18)
        - <14, 10, 3, 1> (10, 3)
        
Step 3:
    - Final count of chordal 4-cycles: [7]
