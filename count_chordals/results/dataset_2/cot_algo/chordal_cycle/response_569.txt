Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 19) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 4) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 19) (2, 14) (2, 3) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 15) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (12, 9) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 15) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 13) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 0) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: 4-17-6-15-9-4  
- Cycle 2: 4-9-18-17-6-4  
- Cycle 3: 4-9-16-3-5-6-4  
- Cycle 4: 4-9-16-19-10-1-13-4  
- Cycle 5: 4-9-12-9-4  
- Cycle 6: 5-3-16-9-15-6-5  
- Cycle 7: 5-3-16-19-10-1-13-5  
- Cycle 8: 5-3-16-9-15-8-7-5  
- Cycle 9: 5-3-0-13-1-10-19-16-9-15-5  
- Cycle 10: 5-6-17-18-4-9-15-5  
- Cycle 11: 5-7-8-15-9-16-3-5  
- Cycle 12: 5-7-8-15-6-17-18-4-13-5  
- Cycle 13: 5-7-8-15-9-16-19-10-1-13-5  
- Cycle 14: 5-8-15-9-16-3-2-5  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).  
- <4, (17, 6), 15, 9>  
- <4, 9, (18, 17), 6>  
- <4, 9, (16, 3), 5, 6>  
- <4, 9, 16, (19, 10), 1, 13>  
- <4, 9, (12, 9), 4>  
- <5, 3, 16, 9, (15, 6), 5>  
- <5, 3, 16, (19, 10), 1, 13, 5>  
- <5, 3, 16, 9, (15, 8), 7, 5>  
- <5, 3, 0, 13, 1, 10, 19, 16, 9, 15, 5>  
- <5, 6, 17, 18, (4, 9), 15, 5>  
- <5, 7, 8, 15, 9, 16, (3, 2), 5>  
- <5, 7, 8, 15, (6, 17), 18, 4, 13, 5>  
- <5, 7, 8, 15, 9, 16, (19, 10), 1, 13, 5>  
- <5, 8, 15, 9, 16, (3, 2), 5>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.  
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [14].
