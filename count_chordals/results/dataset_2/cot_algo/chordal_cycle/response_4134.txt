Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-4-12-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-9-8-13-5
        - Cycle 3: 5-13-8-2-5
        - Cycle 4: 5-13-11-14-5
        - Cycle 5: 5-11-13-8-5
        - Cycle 6: 5-11-14-4-5
        - Cycle 7: 9-4-12-2-9
        - Cycle 8: 9-8-13-11-9
        - Cycle 9: 4-12-3-6-4
        - Cycle 10: 8-13-11-6-8
        - Cycle 11: 13-11-6-2-13
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord (4, 12)  ⟶  <5, (4, 12), 9>
        - Cycle 2 has a chord (9, 13)  ⟶  <5, (9, 13), 8>
        - Cycle 3 has a chord (8, 2)  ⟶  <5, (8, 2), 13>
        - Cycle 4 has a chord (13, 11)  ⟶  <5, (13, 11), 14>
        - Cycle 5 has a chord (13, 8)  ⟶  <5, (13, 8), 11>
        - Cycle 6 has a chord (11, 14)  ⟶  <5, (11, 14), 4>
        - Cycle 8 has a chord (13, 11)  ⟶  <9, (13, 11), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        We found 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [7].
