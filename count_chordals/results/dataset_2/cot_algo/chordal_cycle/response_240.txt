Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1:  
Here are the cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 7 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 1 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 6 - 9 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 4: 1 - 4 - 7 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 9 - 6 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 6: 2 - 7 - 9 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 7: 0 - 6 - 8 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 8: 0 - 3 - 5 - 2 - 0

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (0, 2)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (3, 5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have 8 unique chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the answer is [8].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, (0, 2), 4> 
<1, (1, 6), 4> 
<6, (6, 9), 0> 
<4, (4, 9), 1> 
<1, (9, 6), 5> 
<7, (7, 6), 2> 
<0, (6, 8), 9> 
<2, (3, 5), 0>
