Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-6-2-0
- Cycle 2: 1-4-2-6-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-8-9-7-1
- Cycle 4: 2-4-8-9-2
- Cycle 5: 3-0-5-6-3
- Cycle 6: 3-6-8-4-1-7-3
- Cycle 7: 5-6-8-9-5
- Cycle 8: 6-2-4-1-6
- Cycle 9: 7-1-4-2-8-7
- Cycle 10: 8-4-2-6-8
- Cycle 11: 8-6-5-0-9-8

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (5, 2) forming the chordal 4-cycle <0, 5, (5, 2), 2>.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 6) forming the chordal 4-cycle <1, 4, (4, 6), 6>.
- Cycle 3 has a chord (1, 9) forming the chordal 4-cycle <1, 4, 8, (1, 9), 7>.
- Cycle 4 has a chord (4, 9) forming the chordal 4-cycle <2, 4, (4, 9), 8>.
- Cycle 6 has a chord (6, 8) forming the chordal 4-cycle <3, 6, 8, (6, 8), 4>.
- Cycle 7 has a chord (6, 9) forming the chordal 4-cycle <5, 6, 8, (6, 9), 5>.
- Cycle 9 has a chord (7, 2) forming the chordal 4-cycle <7, 1, 4, (7, 2), 8>.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]
