Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 15) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 17) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 16) (13, 7) (13, 4) (1, 14) (1, 19) (15, 12) (15, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 3) (19, 6) (0, 12) (0, 15) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 11) (6, 19) (6, 11) (6, 17) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 5) (16, 17) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 19) (3, 10) (4, 5) (4, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 2-5-4-13
- Cycle 2: 2-5-16-17
- Cycle 3: 2-8-3-9
- Cycle 4: 2-8-7-13
- Cycle 5: 3-8-2-17
- Cycle 6: 3-9-7-13
- Cycle 7: 4-5-2-8
- Cycle 8: 4-5-16-17
- Cycle 9: 5-2-8-7
- Cycle 10: 5-16-17-2
- Cycle 11: 7-8-2-5
- Cycle 12: 7-9-3-8
- Cycle 13: 8-2-5-4
- Cycle 14: 8-3-9-7
- Cycle 15: 9-3-8-2
- Cycle 16: 9-7-13-4
- Cycle 17: 13-7-9-3

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 7: 4-5-2-8. The chord is the edge between vertices 2 and 8, which is (2, 8). 

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, (2, 8), 5>.
