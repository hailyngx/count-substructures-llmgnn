Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 13, 1)  
- Cycle 2: (5, 2, 12, 0)  
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 10, 9)  
- Cycle 4: (5, 8, 7, 6)  
- Cycle 5: (5, 4, 3, 0)  
- Cycle 6: (9, 14, 11, 5)  
- Cycle 7: (9, 14, 11, 0)  
- Cycle 8: (9, 14, 11, 2)  
- Cycle 9: (9, 14, 11, 0)  
- Cycle 10: (1, 13, 10, 9)  
- Cycle 11: (1, 13, 10, 8)  
- Cycle 12: (1, 13, 6, 5)  
- Cycle 13: (3, 4, 6, 7)  
- Cycle 14: (3, 0, 10, 7)  
- Cycle 15: (8, 10, 13, 1)  
- Cycle 16: (8, 10, 0, 3)  
- Cycle 17: (8, 2, 11, 0)  
- Cycle 18: (8, 7, 6, 5)  
- Cycle 19: (13, 6, 7, 8)  
- Cycle 20: (6, 7, 8, 5)  
- Cycle 21: (2, 10, 0, 3)  
- Cycle 22: (2, 4, 3, 0)  
- Cycle 23: (2, 11, 14, 9)  
- Cycle 24: (2, 4, 6, 5)  

Step 2:  
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (6, 1)  
- Cycle 2 has a chord (2, 0)  
- Cycle 4 has a chord (8, 6)  
- Cycle 6 has a chord (14, 5)  
- Cycle 10 has a chord (13, 9)  
- Cycle 11 has a chord (13, 8)  
- Cycle 17 has a chord (2, 0)  
- Cycle 19 has a chord (6, 8)  
- Cycle 20 has a chord (7, 8)  

Step 3:  
Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 15 chordless cycles found.  

Therefore, the final answer is [15].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 6, 13, 1>  
- <5, 2, 12, 0>  
- <5, 8, 7, 6>  
- <5, 4, 3, 0>  
- <9, 14, 11, 5>  
- <1, 13, 10, 8>  
- <8, 2, 11, 0>  
- <4, 6, 7, 8>  
- <6, 7, 8, 5>
