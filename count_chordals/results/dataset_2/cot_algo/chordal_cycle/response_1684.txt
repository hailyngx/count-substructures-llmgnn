Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 7) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle: 5-9-10-4
2. Cycle: 5-9-1-0
3. Cycle: 5-6-1-0
4. Cycle: 5-6-3-11
5. Cycle: 5-13-7-12
6. Cycle: 9-5-6-1
7. Cycle: 9-5-13-7
8. Cycle: 9-11-4-8
9. Cycle: 9-11-3-6
10. Cycle: 10-9-5-6
11. Cycle: 10-4-8-2
12. Cycle: 10-4-11-3
13. Cycle: 11-9-5-13
14. Cycle: 11-4-8-2
15. Cycle: 11-4-10-0
16. Cycle: 8-4-10-0
17. Cycle: 12-9-5-13
18. Cycle: 12-7-14-13
19. Cycle: 12-3-11-4
20. Cycle: 2-5-13-7
21. Cycle: 2-8-4-10
22. Cycle: 2-8-10-0
23. Cycle: 2-1-0-7
24. Cycle: 0-4-8-10
25. Cycle: 0-4-11-3
26. Cycle: 0-1-6-5

Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

1. Cycle 5-9-10-4 has one chord: (9, 4)
2. Cycle 5-9-1-0 has one chord: (9, 0)
3. Cycle 5-6-1-0 has one chord: (6, 0)
4. Cycle 5-6-3-11 has one chord: (6, 11)
5. Cycle 5-13-7-12 has one chord: (13, 7)
6. Cycle 9-5-6-1 has one chord: (5, 1)
7. Cycle 9-5-13-7 has one chord: (5, 7)
8. Cycle 9-11-4-8 has one chord: (11, 8)
9. Cycle 9-11-3-6 has one chord: (11, 3)
10. Cycle 10-9-5-6 has one chord: (9, 6)
11. Cycle 10-4-8-2 has one chord: (4, 2)
12. Cycle 10-4-11-3 has one chord: (4, 11)
13. Cycle 11-9-5-13 has one chord: (9, 13)
14. Cycle 11-4-8-2 has one chord: (4, 8)
15. Cycle 11-4-10-0 has one chord: (4, 10)
16. Cycle 8-4-10-0 has one chord: (4, 10)
17. Cycle 12-9-5-13 has one chord: (9, 13)
18. Cycle 12-7-14-13 has one chord: (7, 14)
19. Cycle 12-3-11-4 has one chord: (3, 11)
20. Cycle 2-5-13-7 has one chord: (5, 7)
21. Cycle 2-8-4-10 has one chord: (8, 10)
22. Cycle 2-8-10-0 has one chord: (8, 10)
23. Cycle 2-1-0-7 has one chord: (1, 7)
24. Cycle 0-4-8-10 has one chord: (4, 8)
25. Cycle 0-4-11-3 has one chord: (4, 11)
26. Cycle 0-1-6-5 has one chord: (1, 6)

As there are 26 chordal 4-cycles found, the final number is [26].
