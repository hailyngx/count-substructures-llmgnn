Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-8-7-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-1-7-4-5
        - Cycle 3: 9-8-7-4-9
        - Cycle 4: 9-2-6-3-9
        - Cycle 5: 9-0-6-4-9
        - Cycle 6: 4-7-1-5-4
        - Cycle 7: 4-8-9-5-4
        - Cycle 8: 4-0-6-2-4
        - Cycle 9: 7-1-5-8-7
        - Cycle 10: 1-6-2-9-1
        - Cycle 11: 3-9-8-1-3
        - Cycle 12: 3-6-4-0-3
        
Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: Chord <8, 7> ✅
        - Cycle 2: Chord <1, 4> ✅
        - Cycle 3: Chord <8, 4> ✅
        - Cycle 4: Chord <2, 6> ✅
        - Cycle 5: Chord <0, 6> ✅
        - Cycle 6: Chord <7, 5> ✅
        - Cycle 7: Chord <9, 5> ✅
        - Cycle 8: Chord <8, 6> ✅
        - Cycle 9: Chord <1, 8> ✅
        - Cycle 10: Chord <6, 9> ✅
        - Cycle 11: Chord <8, 1> ✅
        - Cycle 12: Chord <4, 0> ✅
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, (8, 7), 9)>
<1, (4, 6), 7)>
<9, (8, 4), 7)>
<2, (2, 6), 9)>
<0, (0, 6), 9)>
<7, (5, 9), 4)>
<5, (1, 8), 4)>
<8, (8, 6), 4)>
<1, (1, 8), 5)>
<6, (6, 9), 2)>
<9, (8, 1), 3)>
<4, (4, 0), 6)>
