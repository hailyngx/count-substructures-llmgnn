Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 6, 17, 28>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 4, 22, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 29, 25, 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 22, 19, 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 18, 20, 24>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <8, 9, 2, 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <10, 11, 22, 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <14, 17, 19, 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <15, 19, 22, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <16, 27, 12, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <16, 21, 25, 29>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <23, 15, 26, 29>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

- There are 12 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count inside brackets is [12].
