Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 8) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 7) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 12) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 19) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 7) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 18) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 4) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 9) (18, 0) (19, 15) (19, 1) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 19) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (13, 16, 11, 12, 13)
- Cycle 2: (10, 17, 0, 3, 10)
- Cycle 3: (4, 6, 5, 3, 4)
- Cycle 4: (1, 2, 13, 16, 1)
- Cycle 5: (8, 17, 0, 3, 8)
- Cycle 6: (9, 8, 17, 10, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 has a chord: (16, 11) -> Chordal 4-cycle <1, (16, 11), 13, 12>
- Cycle 2 does not have a chord
- Cycle 3 does not have a chord
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (13, 2) -> Chordal 4-cycle <2, 1, (13, 2), 16>
- Cycle 5 does not have a chord
- Cycle 6 does not have a chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found:

- <1, (16, 11), 13, 12>
- <2, 1, (13, 2), 16>

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
