        - <1, 12, 13, 14>
        - <1, 6, 20, 22>
        - <1, 12, 13, 22>
        - <3, 15, 23, 1>
        - <3, 17, 19, 22>
        - <3, 17, 19, 26>
        - <3, 15, 23, 3>
        - <3, 17, 19, 26>

        - <15, 9, (21, 25)>
        - <23, 1, (12, 13)>
        - <23, 3, (15, 28)>
        - <15, 9, (21, 25)>
        - <18, 6, (1, 12)>
