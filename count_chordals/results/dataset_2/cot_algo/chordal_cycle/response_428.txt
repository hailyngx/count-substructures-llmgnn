Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. (1, 3, 6, 2)
2. (1, 3, 6, 2, 5)
3. (1, 4, 7, 9)
4. (1, 4, 7, 9, 8)
5. (1, 4, 7, 9, 3)
6. (1, 4, 7, 9, 3, 6)
7. (1, 4, 3, 6, 2)
8. (1, 4, 3, 6, 2, 5)
9. (1, 7, 9, 8)
10. (1, 7, 9, 3)
11. (1, 7, 9, 3, 6)
12. (1, 9, 3, 6, 2)
13. (3, 6, 2, 5)
14. (4, 7, 9, 8)
15. (4, 7, 9, 3)
16. (4, 7, 9, 3, 6)
17. (4, 9, 3, 6, 2)

Step 2:
Now, we will check each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. (1, 3, 6, 2) - Chord: <1, 6>
2. (1, 3, 6, 2, 5) - Chord: <1, 6>
3. (1, 4, 7, 9) - Chord: <4, 7>
4. (1, 4, 7, 9, 8) - Chord: <4, 7>
5. (1, 4, 7, 9, 3) - Chord: <4, 7>
6. (1, 4, 7, 9, 3, 6) - Chord: <4, 7>
7. (1, 4, 3, 6, 2) - Chord: <1, 2>
8. (1, 4, 3, 6, 2, 5) - Chord: <1, 2>
9. (1, 7, 9, 8) - Chord: <7, 9>
10. (1, 7, 9, 3) - Chord: <7, 9>
11. (1, 7, 9, 3, 6) - Chord: <7, 9>
12. (1, 9, 3, 6, 2) - Chord: <1, 2>
13. (3, 6, 2, 5) - Chord: <3, 6>
14. (4, 7, 9, 8) - Chord: <4, 7>
15. (4, 7, 9, 3) - Chord: <4, 7>
16. (4, 7, 9, 3, 6) - Chord: <4, 7>
17. (4, 9, 3, 6, 2) - Chord: <4, 6>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <1, (4, 7), 9>
2. <1, (4, 7), 3>
3. <1, 4, (3, 6), 2>
