Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 15) (9, 5) (1, 13) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 19) (18, 17) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 15) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 13) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 19) (13, 1) (13, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing in the given graph.

Step 2:
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Step 3:
- The number of chordless cycles found is 0.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
