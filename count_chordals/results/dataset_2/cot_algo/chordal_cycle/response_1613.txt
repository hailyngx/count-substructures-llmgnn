Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 8) (17, 13) (17, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 18) (0, 6) (0, 5) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 2) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 12) (16, 3) (16, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 10) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 10) (12, 13) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 11) (18, 12) (10, 19) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
1. <3, 15, 7, 1, 6, 13, 17, 2, 19, 10>
2. <3, 15, 7, 1, 6, 9, 4, 8, 14, 3>
3. <11, 3, 15, 7, 1, 6, 0, 5, 19, 2, 11>
4. <4, 8, 14, 3, 16, 1, 6, 13, 17, 2, 19, 10, 1>
5. <8, 14, 3, 16, 1, 6, 13, 12, 18, 2, 19, 10, 1>
6. <0, 6, 1, 7, 15, 3, 16, 1>
7. <9, 4, 8, 14, 3, 16, 1, 10, 19, 5, 0, 6>
8. <2, 19, 5, 0, 6, 1, 7, 15, 3, 11, 18, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. In cycle 1, <3, 15, 7, 1, 6, 13, 17, 2, 19, 10>, the chords are (15, 6) and (13, 2).
2. In cycle 2, <3, 15, 7, 1, 6, 9, 4, 8, 14, 3>, the chords are (15, 8) and (9, 14).
3. In cycle 3, <11, 3, 15, 7, 1, 6, 0, 5, 19, 2, 11>, the chords are (3, 5) and (1, 19).
4. In cycle 4, <4, 8, 14, 3, 16, 1, 6, 13, 17, 2, 19, 10, 1>, the chords are (8, 16) and (13, 19).
5. In cycle 5, <8, 14, 3, 16, 1, 6, 13, 12, 18, 2, 19, 10, 1>, the chords are (14, 12) and (16, 18).
6. In cycle 6, <0, 6, 1, 7, 15, 3, 16, 1>, the chords are (6, 15) and (1, 16).
7. In cycle 7, <9, 4, 8, 14, 3, 16, 1, 10, 19, 5, 0, 6>, the chords are (4, 10) and (8, 0).
8. In cycle 8, <2, 19, 5, 0, 6, 1, 7, 15, 3, 11, 18, 2>, the chords are (19, 6) and (5, 1).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [8] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
