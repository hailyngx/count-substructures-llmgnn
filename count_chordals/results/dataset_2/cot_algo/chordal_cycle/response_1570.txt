Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <13, (8, 16), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <13, (8, 1), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <13, (8, 1), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <13, (8, 16), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <13, (8, 1), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <13, (8, 4), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, (8, 12), 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, (8, 12), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <1, (8, 16), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <1, (8, 16), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <1, (8, 2), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <1, (8, 2), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <10, (6, 15), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <10, (3, 15), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <10, (3, 15), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <3, (13, 19), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <3, (13, 19), 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <3, (10, 6), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <3, (10, 6), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <9, (0, 16), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [20].
