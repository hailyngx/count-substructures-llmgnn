Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (11, 16), 5, 9, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (11, 14), 7, 0, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (11, 14), 7, (18, 29), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (16, 23), 21, 13, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (16, 19), 24, 28, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (15, 27), 21, 13, 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (5, 9), 13, 21, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (5, 9), 16, 19, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (9, 16), 23, 10, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (9, 16), 19, 24, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <11, (9, 16), 19, 24, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <12, (12, 9), 16, 23, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <13, (14, 11), 16, 23, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <14, (16, 19), 24, 28, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <15, (19, 16), 11, 14, 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <16, (21, 13), 9, 16, 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <17, (26, 5), 9, 13, 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <18, (26, 5), 9, 13, 26>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 18 chordal 4-cycles, so the final answer is [18].
