Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 16) (1, 18) (12, 10) (12, 17) (2, 15) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 11) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 14) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 10) (9, 17) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 15) (14, 13) (14, 16) (14, 11) (18, 1) (18, 0) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 0) (0, 18) (0, 17) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 2, 8, 5, 3)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 8, 5, 11, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 10, 12, 17, 15, 2, 8, 7)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 10, 6, 11, 5, 8, 7)
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 10, 19, 13, 15, 17, 12, 10)
- Cycle 6: (1, 16, 4, 11, 6, 10, 12, 17, 15, 2, 8, 5, 3, 15, 13, 19, 10, 7, 8, 2, 15, 14, 13, 19, 4)
- Cycle 7: (1, 16, 4, 11, 6, 10, 7, 8, 2, 15, 13, 19, 10, 6)
- Cycle 8: (1, 16, 4, 7, 10, 19, 13, 15, 2, 8, 5, 3, 15, 17, 12, 10, 11, 14, 13, 19)
- ... (More cycles listed)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:

<3, 15, 2, (8, 5)>
<4, 7, 8, (5, 11)>
<4, 7, 10, (19, 13)>
<1, 16, 4, (11, 6)>
<5, 3, 15, (13, 19)>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
