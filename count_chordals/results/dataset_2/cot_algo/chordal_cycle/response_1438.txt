Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 2 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 4 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 3: 2 - 7 - 0 - 2
- Cycle 4: 3 - 4 - 6 - 3
- Cycle 5: 4 - 6 - 2 - 4
- Cycle 6: 5 - 7 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 7: 9 - 1 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 8: 9 - 2 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 9: 9 - 4 - 0 - 9
- Cycle 10: 9 - 8 - 6 - 9

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <0, (6, 2), 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, (4, 6), 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, (7, 0), 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, (4, 6), 3>
- Cycle 5: <4, (6, 2), 4>
- Cycle 6: <5, (7, 2), 5>
- Cycle 7: <9, (1, 6), 9>
- Cycle 8: <9, (2, 3), 9>
- Cycle 9: <9, (4, 0), 9>
- Cycle 10: <9, (8, 6), 9>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles in total.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
