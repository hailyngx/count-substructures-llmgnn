Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 4-9-6-4
        - Cycle 2: 4-1-0-4
        - Cycle 3: 4-6-7-8-4
        - Cycle 4: 4-8-1-0-4
        - Cycle 5: 4-6-9-3-4
        - Cycle 6: 4-9-3-0-4
        - Cycle 7: 4-1-2-5-4
        - Cycle 8: 6-9-3-8-6
        - Cycle 9: 6-7-8-5-6
        - Cycle 10: 6-4-8-5-6
        - Cycle 11: 6-4-9-3-6
        - Cycle 12: 6-9-0-4-6
        - Cycle 13: 7-6-4-8-7
        - Cycle 14: 7-6-9-3-7
        - Cycle 15: 7-8-5-3-7
        - Cycle 16: 7-8-1-0-7
        - Cycle 17: 9-6-7-8-9
        - Cycle 18: 9-4-8-3-9
        - Cycle 19: 9-4-6-7-9
        - Cycle 20: 9-3-8-5-9
        - Cycle 21: 3-9-6-4-3
        - Cycle 22: 3-9-4-0-3
        - Cycle 23: 3-8-5-7-3
        - Cycle 24: 3-8-1-4-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - <4, 6, 9, 8> has one chord, (4, 8).
        - <4, 1, 0, 4> has one chord, (1, 0).
        - <4, 6, 7, 8> has one chord, (6, 8).
        - <4, 8, 1, 0> has one chord, (8, 1).
        - <4, 6, 9, 3> has one chord, (6, 9).
        - <4, 9, 3, 0> has one chord, (9, 0).
        - <4, 1, 2, 5> has one chord, (1, 2).
        - <6, 9, 3, 8> has one chord, (9, 8).
        - <6, 7, 8, 5> has one chord, (7, 5).
        - <6, 4, 8, 5> has one chord, (4, 5).
        - <6, 4, 9, 3> has one chord, (4, 9).
        - <7, 6, 4, 8> has one chord, (6, 8).
        - <7, 6, 9, 3> has one chord, (6, 9).
        - <7, 8, 5, 3> has one chord, (8, 3).
        - <7, 8, 1, 0> has one chord, (8, 1).
        - <9, 6, 7, 8> has one chord, (6, 8).
        - <9, 4, 8, 3> has one chord, (4, 3).
        - <9, 4, 6, 7> has one chord, (4, 6).
        - <9, 3, 8, 5> has one chord, (3, 5).
        - <3, 9, 6, 4> has one chord, (9, 4).
        - <3, 9, 4, 0> has one chord, (9, 4).
        - <3, 8, 5, 7> has one chord, (8, 7).
        - <3, 8, 1, 4> has one chord, (8, 1).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        - There are 24 chordal 4-cycles found.
        
Putting the final count inside brackets, the answer is [24].
