Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 9) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 13) (11, 7) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: 11 - 7 - 4 - 6 - 11
        - Cycle 2: 13 - 1 - 17 - 16 - 13
        - Cycle 3: 15 - 5 - 6 - 0 - 15
        - Cycle 4: 10 - 8 - 5 - 3 - 10
        - Cycle 5: 12 - 4 - 7 - 11 - 12
        - Cycle 6: 18 - 15 - 5 - 8 - 18
        - Cycle 7: 9 - 2 - 0 - 6 - 9
        - Cycle 8: 16 - 17 - 1 - 13 - 16
        - Cycle 9: 3 - 4 - 12 - 9 - 3
        - Cycle 10: 19 - 8 - 5 - 15 - 19
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - <1, 17, 16, (13)>
        - <5, 6, 0, (15)>
        - <5, 8, 18, (15)>
        - <5, 3, 10, (8)>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

        There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [4].
