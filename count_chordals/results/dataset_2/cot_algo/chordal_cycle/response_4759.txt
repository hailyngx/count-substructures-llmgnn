Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
       - Cycle 1: (4, 7, 3, 9, 4)
       - Cycle 2: (6, 5, 8, 1, 6)
       - Cycle 3: (4, 9, 0, 2, 4)
       - Cycle 4: (4, 5, 8, 1, 4)
       - Cycle 5: (4, 3, 0, 9, 4)
       - Cycle 6: (7, 4, 9, 0, 7)
       - Cycle 7: (4, 2, 6, 1, 4)
       - Cycle 8: (2, 0, 9, 3, 2)
       - Cycle 9: (2, 1, 8, 5, 2)
       - Cycle 10: (4, 5, 3, 7, 4)
       - Cycle 11: (6, 2, 0, 1, 6)
       - Cycle 12: (5, 8, 1, 6, 5)
       - Cycle 13: (4, 9, 2, 6, 4)
       - Cycle 14: (9, 3, 0, 1, 9)
       - Cycle 15: (5, 6, 2, 4, 5)
       - Cycle 16: (8, 1, 6, 5, 8)
       - Cycle 17: (4, 2, 0, 9, 4)
       - Cycle 18: (3, 7, 4, 9, 3)
       - Cycle 19: (0, 9, 3, 5, 0)
       - Cycle 20: (2, 1, 0, 9, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
       - Cycle 14 <2, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
       - There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final answer is [1].
