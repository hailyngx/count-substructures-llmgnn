Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (0, 4, 9, 3, 0)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 4, 7, 2, 0)
        - Cycle 3: (0, 4, 7, 5, 0)
        - Cycle 4: (0, 4, 7, 6, 0)
        - Cycle 5: (0, 6, 7, 2, 0)
        - Cycle 6: (0, 6, 7, 5, 0)
        - Cycle 7: (0, 6, 5, 1, 0)
        - Cycle 8: (0, 1, 5, 7, 0)
        - Cycle 9: (0, 1, 5, 8, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: (0, 4, 9, 3, 0) has one chord (0, 9)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 4, 7, 2, 0) has one chord (0, 2)
        - Cycle 3: (0, 4, 7, 5, 0) has one chord (0, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (0, 4, 7, 6, 0) has one chord (0, 6)
        - Cycle 5: (0, 6, 7, 2, 0) has one chord (0, 2)
        - Cycle 6: (0, 6, 7, 5, 0) has one chord (0, 5)
        - Cycle 7: (0, 6, 5, 1, 0) has one chord (0, 1)
        - Cycle 8: (0, 1, 5, 7, 0) has one chord (0, 7)
        - Cycle 9: (0, 1, 5, 8, 0) has one chord (0, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, hence [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <1, (0, 9), 3)>
        <2, (0, 2), 4)>
        <3, (0, 5), 7)>
        <4, (0, 6), 5)>
        <5, (0, 2), 6)>
        <6, (0, 5), 6)>
        <7, (0, 1), 5)>
        <8, (0, 7), 1)>
        <9, (0, 8), 5)>
