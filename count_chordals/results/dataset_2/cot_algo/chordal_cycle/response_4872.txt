Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 1 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 9 - 0 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 9 - 2 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 9 - 4 - 6
- Cycle 5: 6 - 5 - 3 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 6: 6 - 5 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 7: 6 - 5 - 2 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 8: 6 - 5 - 0 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 9: 6 - 7 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 10: 6 - 7 - 3 - 5 - 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Checking Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 1 - 7 - 6 (This cycle has one chord 1, 7)
- Checking Cycle 2: 6 - 9 - 0 - 1 - 6 (This cycle has one chord 0, 1)
- Checking Cycle 3: 6 - 9 - 2 - 5 - 6 (This cycle has one chord 2, 5)
- Checking Cycle 4: 6 - 9 - 4 - 6 (This cycle has one chord 4, 9)
- Checking Cycle 5: 6 - 5 - 3 - 8 - 6 (This cycle has one chord 3, 8)
- Checking Cycle 6: 6 - 5 - 7 - 6 (This cycle has one chord 5, 7)
- Checking Cycle 7: 6 - 5 - 2 - 1 - 6 (This cycle has one chord 2, 6)
- Checking Cycle 8: 6 - 5 - 0 - 9 - 6 (This cycle has one chord 0, 5)
- Checking Cycle 9: 6 - 7 - 1 - 6 (This cycle has one chord 1, 7)
- Checking Cycle 10: 6 - 7 - 3 - 5 - 6 (This cycle has one chord 3, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <6, (9, 4), 6>.
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
