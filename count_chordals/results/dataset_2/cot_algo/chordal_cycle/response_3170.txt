Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (6, 2) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 4 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 2: 9 - 4 - 7 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 3: 4 - 8 - 5 - 2 - 4
- Cycle 4: 1 - 9 - 3 - 13 - 1
- Cycle 5: 3 - 11 - 2 - 6 - 3
- Cycle 6: 8 - 5 - 0 - 12 - 8

Step 2:  
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <5, (4, 8), 9>
- Cycle 2 <9, (7, 1), 4>
- Cycle 3 <4, (5, 2), 8>
- Cycle 4 <1, (9, 13), 3>
- Cycle 5 <3, (11, 6), 2>
- Cycle 6 <8, (0, 12), 5>

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
