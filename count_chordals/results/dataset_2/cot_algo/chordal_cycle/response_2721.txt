- <0, 3, 11, 19>
- <0, 3, 13, 6>
- <0, 10, 14, 15>
- <0, 16, 2, 19>
- <1, 6, 13, 12>
- <1, 6, 13, 3>
- <1, 6, 18, 17>
- <1, 8, 9, 17>
- <1, 8, 9, 17>
- <2, 0, 7, 14>
- <2, 0, 16, 2>
- <2, 0, 19, 4>
- <3, 0, 7, 14>
- <3, 0, 10, 17>

- <0, 7, 14, 10> (7, 14)
- <0, 7, 14, 15> (7, 14)
- <0, 16, 2, 19> (2, 19)
- <4, 5, 17, 9> (5, 9)
- <4, 5, 17, 10> (5, 10)
- <4, 5, 17, 18> (5, 18)
- <5, 17, 10, 0> (17, 0)
- <5, 17, 18, 6> (17, 6)
- <10, 0, 16, 2> (0, 2)
- <13, 1, 8, 9> (1, 9)
