Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (13, 12, 4, 8, 29, 9, 25, 12)
- Cycle 2: (13, 19, 23, 24, 10, 18, 2, 13)
- Cycle 3: (22, 18, 10, 25, 14, 23, 19, 7, 21, 11, 26, 3, 24, 22)
- Cycle 4: (7, 21, 11, 26, 3, 4, 16, 15, 21)
- Cycle 5: (2, 18, 10, 25, 12, 13, 17, 16, 15, 21, 7, 19, 0, 2)
- Cycle 6: (8, 29, 17, 16, 15, 21, 7, 19, 0, 12, 4, 8)
- Cycle 7: (17, 13, 12, 25, 14, 23, 19, 0, 12, 4, 16, 17)

Step 2:
- Checking cycle 1: (13, 12, 4, 8, 29, 9, 25, 12) is a chordless 4-cycle.
- Checking cycle 2: (13, 19, 23, 24, 10, 18, 2, 13) is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (23, 10).
- Checking cycle 3: (22, 18, 10, 25, 14, 23, 19, 7, 21, 11, 26, 3, 24, 22) is a chordless 4-cycle.
- Checking cycle 4: (7, 21, 11, 26, 3, 4, 16, 15, 21) is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (4, 15).
- Checking cycle 5: (2, 18, 10, 25, 12, 13, 17, 16, 15, 21, 7, 19, 0, 2) is a chordless 4-cycle.
- Checking cycle 6: (8, 29, 17, 16, 15, 21, 7, 19, 0, 12, 4, 8) is a chordless 4-cycle.
- Checking cycle 7: (17, 13, 12, 25, 14, 23, 19, 0, 12, 4, 16, 17) is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (14, 16).

Step 3:
- Total number of chordless 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<13, 19, (23, 10), 18>
<7, 21, (4, 15), 11>
<17, 13, (14, 16), 12>
