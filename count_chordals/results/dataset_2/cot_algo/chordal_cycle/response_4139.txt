Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 0) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 6) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 6) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-13-2-8-4-6-12-3-7 (length 9)
- Cycle 2: 0-5-8-2-13-3-7-11-4-6 (length 9)
- Cycle 3: 1-2-8-5-0-6-4-11-7-3-13 (length 11)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- From Cycle 1, <0, 2> is a chord
- From Cycle 2, <0, 2> is a chord
- From Cycle 3, <8, 0> is a chord

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 2, 8>
