Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 2) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 15) (2, 13) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 18) (12, 8) (16, 8) (16, 18) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 15) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 8) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 19) (19, 1) (19, 15) (18, 12) (18, 16) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 7, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (13, 0, 14, 3, 13)
        - Cycle 3: (17, 13, 4, 11, 17)
        - Cycle 4: (2, 10, 9, 6, 2)
        - Cycle 5: (15, 19, 1, 11, 15)
        - Cycle 6: (8, 1, 19, 15, 8)
        - Cycle 7: (17, 8, 1, 19, 17)
        - Cycle 8: (13, 2, 10, 6, 13)
        - Cycle 9: (14, 0, 13, 17, 14)
        - Cycle 10: (6, 10, 9, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 11: (6, 10, 2, 13, 6)
        - Cycle 12: (18, 16, 8, 3, 18)
        - Cycle 13: (18, 12, 5, 6, 18)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (6, 9).
        - Cycle 8 has exactly one chord (10, 13).
        - Cycle 9 has exactly one chord (0, 17).
        - Cycle 10 has exactly one chord (9, 5).
        - Cycle 11 has exactly one chord (10, 13).
        - Cycle 12 has exactly one chord (16, 8).
        - Cycle 13 has exactly one chord (12, 5).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [7].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <1, (6, 9), 5)>
        <8, (10, 13), 6)>
        <9, (0, 17), 13)>
        <10, (9, 5), 6)>
        <11, (10, 13), 6)>
        <12, (16, 8), 3)>
        <13, (12, 5), 6)>
