Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 5) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 10) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 5) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
<3, 9, 4, 3>
<8, 9, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 9, 1>
<6, 8, 9, 6>
<2, 7, 6, 2>
<12, 13, 9, 12>
<14, 13, 9, 14>
<7, 6, 8, 7>
<5, 3, 9, 5>
<10, 12, 1, 10>
<0, 11, 13, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal cycles:
<3, 9, 4, 3>, Chord: (9, 4)
<8, 9, 3, 8>, Chord: (9, 3)
<1, 4, 9, 1>, Chord: (4, 9)
<6, 8, 9, 6>, Chord: (8, 9)
<2, 7, 6, 2>, Chord: (7, 6)
<12, 13, 9, 12>, Chord: (13, 9)
<14, 13, 9, 14>, Chord: (13, 9)
<7, 6, 8, 7>, Chord: (6, 8)
<5, 3, 9, 5>, Chord: (3, 9)
<10, 12, 1, 10>, Chord: (12, 1)
<0, 11, 13, 0>, Chord: (11, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

Number of chordal 4-cycles: [11]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<3, 9, 4, 3>, Chord: (9, 4)
<8, 9, 3, 8>, Chord: (9, 3)
<1, 4, 9, 1>, Chord: (4, 9)
<6, 8, 9, 6>, Chord: (8, 9)
<2, 7, 6, 2>, Chord: (7, 6)
<12, 13, 9, 12>, Chord: (13, 9)
<14, 13, 9, 14>, Chord: (13, 9)
<7, 6, 8, 7>, Chord: (6, 8)
<5, 3, 9, 5>, Chord: (3, 9)
<10, 12, 1, 10>, Chord: (12, 1)
<0, 11, 13, 0>, Chord: (11, 13)
