Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (3, 2) (15, 9) (15, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 0) (4, 13) (8, 11) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (18, 8) (18, 11) (19, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 9) (0, 17) (0, 1) (9, 15) (9, 16) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 1) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
        <1, 5, 6, 2, 1>
        <1, 5, 15, 9, 16, 3, 2, 6, 1>
        <1, 11, 8, 18, 11>
        <1, 11, 2, 6, 1>
        <1, 11, 2, 3, 16, 9, 15, 5, 1>
        <1, 11, 14, 7, 10, 6, 1>
        <2, 3, 16, 9, 15, 5, 6, 2>
        <2, 6, 13, 4, 12, 7, 14, 11, 2>
        <2, 6, 13, 1, 5, 15, 9, 16, 3, 2>
        <2, 11, 14, 7, 12, 2>
        <5, 6, 13, 4, 12, 7, 14, 11, 5>
        <5, 15, 9, 16, 3, 2, 6, 5>
        <6, 13, 4, 12, 7, 14, 10, 6>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, 5, 6, 2, 1> has a chord (5, 2)
        - <2, 3, 16, 9, 15, 5, 6, 2> has a chord (3, 15)
        - <5, 15, 9, 16, 3, 2, 6, 5> has a chord (9, 2)
        - <6, 13, 4, 12, 7, 14, 11, 5> has a chord (13, 11)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [9]

List of unique chordal 4-cycle:
        <1, 5, 6, 2, 1>
        <2, 3, 16, 9, 15, 5, 6, 2>
        <5, 15, 9, 16, 3, 2, 6, 5>
        <6, 13, 4, 12, 7, 14, 11, 5>
