Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 12) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles present in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1-4-10-5-1
2. Cycle 2-3-7-14-2
3. Cycle 6-2-3-8-6
4. Cycle 6-9-13-1-6
5. Cycle 6-9-13-5-6
6. Cycle 6-2-0-9-6
7. Cycle 6-2-0-13-6
8. Cycle 6-11-12-8-6
9. Cycle 6-11-12-14-6
10. Cycle 6-11-4-10-6
11. Cycle 1-5-13-9-1
12. Cycle 1-5-13-0-1
13. Cycle 0-2-8-3-0
14. Cycle 0-2-6-1-0
15. Cycle 0-2-6-11-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the list above, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, (4, 10), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since only one unique chordal 4-cycle was found, the final count is [1].
