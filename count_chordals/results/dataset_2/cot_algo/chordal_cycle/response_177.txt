Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 5) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 16) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 0) (7, 15) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 17) (1, 10) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 0) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 4) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 4) (4, 15) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 5) (10, 14) (10, 18) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (3, 0, 15, 7, 3)
        - Cycle 2: (14, 17, 1, 10, 14)
        - Cycle 3: (8, 13, 14, 18, 10, 8)
        - Cycle 4: (19, 8, 5, 16, 13, 19)
        - Cycle 5: (12, 13, 8, 19, 11, 12)
        - Cycle 6: (15, 0, 18, 14, 13, 15)
        - Cycle 7: (4, 15, 7, 0, 4)
        - Cycle 8: (12, 17, 1, 10, 18, 12)
        - Cycle 9: (11, 12, 17, 1, 10, 11)
        - Cycle 10: (19, 8, 13, 14, 17, 19)
        - Cycle 11: (5, 8, 13, 16, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, (0, 15), 7, 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <14, (10, 18), 13, 14>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <8, (13, 14), 18, 8>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <19, (8, 13), 16, 19>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <12, (13, 8), 17, 12>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <15, (0, 18), 14, 15>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, (7, 0), 15, 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <12, (17, 1), 10, 12>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <11, (12, 17), 1, 11>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <19, (8, 13), 14, 19>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <5, (8, 13), 16, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        The number of chordless cycles is [0].
