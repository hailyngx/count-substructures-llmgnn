Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <1, 15, 4, 28>
- <1, 15, 23, 0>
- <1, 15, 4, 29>
- <1, 3, 10, 11>
- <1, 3, 10, 27>
- <1, 3, 5, 29>
- <1, 3, 13, 7>
- <2, 8, 28, 4>
- <2, 8, 23, 0>
- <2, 8, 28, 25>
- <2, 8, 23, 15>
- <2, 19, 27, 11>
- <2, 19, 17, 21>
- <3, 1, 15, 4>
- <3, 1, 15, 23>
- <3, 1, 28, 4>
