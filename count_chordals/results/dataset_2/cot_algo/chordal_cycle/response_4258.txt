Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (16, 24) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 24) (23, 24) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 9) (24, 16) (24, 15) (24, 23) (24, 14) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 12) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 0) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 29) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 25) (28, 22) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 5) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (25, 18) (25, 7) (25, 29) (25, 12) (25, 21) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 9) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 9) (21, 3) (21, 4) (21, 25) (5, 26) (5, 7) (0, 8) (0, 17) (14, 15) (14, 24) (14, 7) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 27) (12, 22) (12, 17) (12, 25) (12, 2) (9, 23) (9, 13) (9, 1) (6, 22) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 27) (29, 4) (29, 25) (19, 3) (19, 1) (27, 3) (27, 2) (27, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (8, 23, 24, 14) with edges (8, 23), (23, 24), (24, 14), (14, 8)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 23, 24) with edges (4, 8), (8, 23), (23, 24), (24, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 18, 15, 24) with edges (4, 18), (18, 15), (15, 24), (24, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 14, 24, 15) with edges (7, 14), (14, 24), (24, 15), (15, 7)
- Cycle 5: (22, 12, 17, 10) with edges (22, 12), (12, 17), (17, 10), (10, 22)
- Cycle 6: (22, 12, 25, 18) with edges (22, 12), (12, 25), (25, 18), (18, 22)
- Cycle 7: (7, 14, 15, 24) with edges (7, 14), (14, 15), (15, 24), (24, 7)
- Cycle 8: (18, 25, 7, 14) with edges (18, 25), (25, 7), (7, 14), (14, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (8, 4), 24, (14, 23)> is a chordal 4-cycle because the edge (8, 4) is the only chord in the cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There is only one chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
