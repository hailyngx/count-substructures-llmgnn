Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-6-4-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-4-2-9-5
        - Cycle 3: 5-0-2-4-5
        - Cycle 4: 5-3-2-4-5
        - Cycle 5: 6-9-2-4-6
        - Cycle 6: 6-4-8-6
        - Cycle 7: 4-8-6-4
        - Cycle 8: 4-3-2-9-4
        - Cycle 9: 4-1-2-9-4
        - Cycle 10: 8-6-4-8
        - Cycle 11: 0-5-4-6-0
        - Cycle 12: 0-6-7-0
        - Cycle 13: 0-2-9-1-0
        - Cycle 14: 0-7-1-9-0
        - Cycle 15: 2-9-1-7-2
        - Cycle 16: 2-4-1-7-2

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
        - <5, (9, 6), 4>
        - <5, (4, 2), 9>
        - <5, (0, 2), 4>
        - <5, (3, 2), 4>
        - <6, (9, 2), 4>
        - <6, (4, 8), 6>
        - <4, (8, 6), 4>
        - <4, (3, 2), 9>
        - <4, (1, 2), 9>
        - <8, (6, 4), 8>
        - <0, (5, 4), 6>
        - <0, (6, 7), 0>
        - <0, (2, 9), 1>
        - <0, (7, 1), 9>
        - <2, (9, 1), 7>
        - <2, (4, 1), 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Final result: [16]
