Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 17) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 17) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (1, 18) (1, 10) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 13) (0, 11) (0, 16) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 3) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 2) (10, 8) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. (11, 19, 4, 8)
2. (11, 19, 14, 6)
3. (11, 13, 12, 7)
4. (16, 0, 11, 19)
5. (16, 0, 7, 12)
6. (16, 7, 12, 8)
7. (16, 3, 7, 12)
8. (4, 8, 12, 7)
9. (4, 19, 3, 16)
10. (7, 12, 8, 15)
11. (7, 3, 14, 6)
12. (6, 9, 2, 14)
13. (6, 12, 13, 17)
14. (9, 2, 15, 8)
15. (8, 10, 1, 18)
16. (12, 7, 3, 14)
17. (12, 6, 9, 2)
18. (12, 13, 17, 5)
19. (2, 9, 6, 14)
20. (2, 14, 3, 19)
21. (2, 15, 8, 10)
22. (18, 1, 10, 8)
23. (13, 12, 6, 14)
24. (13, 17, 5, 18)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <11, 19, 4, 8> (Chord: 4, 8)
- <11, 19, 14, 6> (Chord: 14, 6)
- <11, 13, 12, 7> (Chord: 12, 7)
- <16, 0, 11, 19> (Chord: 11, 19)
- <16, 0, 7, 12> (Chord: 7, 12)
- <16, 7, 12, 8> (Chord: 12, 8)
- <16, 3, 7, 12> (Chord: 7, 12)
- <4, 8, 12, 7> (Chord: 12, 7)
- <4, 19, 3, 16> (Chord: 3, 16)
- <7, 12, 8, 15> (Chord: 8, 15)
- <7, 3, 14, 6> (Chord: 14, 6)
- <6, 9, 2, 14> (Chord: 9, 14)
- <6, 12, 13, 17> (Chord: 13, 17)
- <9, 2, 15, 8> (Chord: 15, 8)
- <8, 10, 1, 18> (Chord: 1, 18)
- <12, 7, 3, 14> (Chord: 7, 14)
- <12, 6, 9, 2> (Chord: 9, 2)
- <12, 13, 17, 5> (Chord: 13, 17)
- <2, 9, 6, 14> (Chord: 9, 14)
- <2, 14, 3, 19> (Chord: 3, 19)
- <2, 15, 8, 10> (Chord: 8, 10)
- <18, 1, 10, 8> (Chord: 10, 8)
- <13, 12, 6, 14> (Chord: 6, 14)
- <13, 17, 5, 18> (Chord: 17, 18)

Step 3:
Count of chordless 4-cycles in the graph: [0]
