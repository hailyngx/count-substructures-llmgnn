This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 16) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 21) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 12) (29, 17) (29, 19) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 22) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 2) (18, 11) (18, 26) (18, 19) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 20) (13, 0) (13, 16) (28, 26) (28, 24) (28, 5) (16, 27) (16, 13) (16, 21) (21, 0) (21, 16) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 24) (2, 11) (2, 20) (2, 7) (22, 3) (22, 11) (22, 5) (19, 29) (19, 18) (19, 20) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 20) (7, 8) (7, 2) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 25) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 19) (20, 12) (20, 6) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 25) (9, 11) (6, 20) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 22) (10, 1)

- Cycle 7: (1, 17, 29, 19)
- Cycle 8: (1, 17, 12, 14)
- Cycle 9: (1, 17, 12, 20)
- Cycle 10: (1, 10, 1, 4)
- Cycle 11: (1, 10, 1, 14)

- Cycle 13: (3, 8, 4, 27)
- Cycle 14: (3, 8, 4, 12)
- Cycle 15: (3, 8, 4, 23)
- Cycle 16: (3, 8, 7, 2)
- Cycle 17: (3, 11, 22, 5)
- Cycle 18: (3, 11, 22, 3)
- Cycle 19: (3, 11, 22, 11)
- Cycle 20: (3, 11, 18, 26)
- Cycle 21: (3, 24, 25, 23)
- Cycle 22: (3, 24, 28, 26)
- Cycle 23: (3, 24, 28, 5)
- Cycle 24: (3, 23, 25, 24)
- Cycle 25: (3, 23, 25, 27)
- Cycle 26: (3, 23, 4, 12)
- Cycle 27: (3, 23, 4, 8)
- Cycle 28: (3, 23, 4, 1)
- Cycle 29: (7, 8, 4, 27)
- Cycle 30: (7, 8, 4, 12)
- Cycle 31: (7, 8, 3, 11)
- Cycle 32: (7, 2, 11, 3)
- Cycle 33: (7, 2, 11, 22)
- Cycle 34: (9, 11, 3, 8)
- Cycle 35: (9, 11, 22, 3)
- Cycle 36: (10, 1, 4, 27)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (4, 27), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (4, 27), 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (4, 8), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (4, 23), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (17, 29), 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (17, 12), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, (17, 12), 20>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <3, (8, 4), 27>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <3, (8, 4), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <3, (11, 22), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <3, (24, 28), 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <3, (23, 25), 24>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <3, (23, 25), 27>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <7, (8, 4), 27>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <7, (8, 4), 12>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
Since we have 15 unique chordal 4-cycles, the number of chordless cycles found is therefore [36].
