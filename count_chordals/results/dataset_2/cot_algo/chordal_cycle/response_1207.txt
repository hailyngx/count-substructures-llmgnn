Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 7) (4, 16) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 13) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 13) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 3) (19, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 18) (6, 14) (6, 16) (6, 8) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 18) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 1) (18, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. Cycle 5-16-4-7-5
2. Cycle 2-17-14-6-2
3. Cycle 9-11-13-1-9
4. Cycle 12-0-9-11-12
5. Cycle 16-6-8-18-16

Step 2:
Among these cycles, only the cycle 9-11-13-1-9 has exactly one chord: (9, 1) connecting non-adjacent nodes 9 and 1.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<9, (9, 1), 11>
