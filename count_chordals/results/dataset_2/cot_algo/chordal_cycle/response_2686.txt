Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 3) (15, 13) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 14) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 19) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 12) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 17) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 17) (1, 10) (1, 19) (21, 2) (21, 29) (8, 23) (8, 19) (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 18) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 10) (26, 28) (26, 16) (28, 22) (28, 26) (28, 4) (28, 10) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 29) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 8) (24, 27) (24, 16) (16, 0) (16, 26) (16, 24) (4, 28) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 14) (11, 7) (29, 21) (29, 7) (29, 14) (14, 27) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 0) (17, 23) (17, 4) (17, 2) (25, 6) (25, 5) (25, 14) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 28) (10, 2) (18, 3) (20, 6) (20, 9) (2, 21) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (8, 23, 17, 2)
- (7, 0, 27, 14)
- (14, 29, 7, 11)
- (6, 9, 13, 3)
- (4, 13, 15, 3)
- (16, 0, 27, 14)

Step 2:
Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- <2, (4, 17), 28>
- <14, (7, 27), 0>
- <9, (6, 13), 3>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <2, (4, 17), 28>
- <14, (7, 27), 0>
- <9, (6, 13), 3>
