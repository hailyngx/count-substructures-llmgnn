Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: 0-1-9-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-9-8-0
- Cycle 3: 0-8-9-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-8-9-1-0
- Cycle 5: 0-7-9-8-0
- Cycle 6: 0-7-9-1-0
- Cycle 7: 0-7-8-9-0
- Cycle 8: 1-9-8-0-1
- Cycle 9: 1-9-2-0-1
- Cycle 10: 1-9-8-5-1
- Cycle 11: 2-9-8-0-2
- Cycle 12: 3-0-8-7-3
- Cycle 13: 3-0-7-9-3
- Cycle 14: 3-0-7-8-3
- Cycle 15: 4-9-8-5-4
- Cycle 16: 5-8-9-6-5
- Cycle 17: 5-8-9-1-5
- Cycle 18: 5-8-2-9-5
- Cycle 19: 6-9-8-5-6
- Cycle 20: 7-8-9-6-7
- Cycle 21: 7-8-9-1-7

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle <0, (1, 9), 2> has exactly one chord: (1, 9).

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
