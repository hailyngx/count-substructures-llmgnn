Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 15) (17, 10) (17, 11) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 0) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 19) (16, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 15) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (7, 10, 11, 1, 7)
- Cycle 2: (7, 10, 11, 15, 6, 12, 7)
- Cycle 3: (7, 12, 6, 1, 11, 10, 7)
- Cycle 4: (1, 11, 10, 17, 7, 12, 1)
- Cycle 5: (12, 7, 10, 11, 15, 6, 12)
- Cycle 6: (1, 5, 14, 12, 7, 10, 11, 1)
- Cycle 7: (4, 13, 0, 2, 1, 6, 12, 14, 5, 19, 4)

Step 2: 
Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chord found: (10, 1) - <7, (10, 1), 11>
- Cycle 2: Chord found: (11, 6) - <7, (11, 6), 15, 12>
- Cycle 3: Chord found: (12, 1) - <7, (12, 1), 6>
- Cycle 4: Chord found: (10, 12) - <1, (10, 12), 7>
- Cycle 5: Chord found: (10, 15) - <1, (10, 15), 11, 12>
- Cycle 6: Chord found: (1, 12) - <1, (1, 12), 6, 7>
- Cycle 7: No chord found

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <7, (10, 1), 11>
- <7, (11, 6), 15, 12>
- <7, (12, 1), 6>
- <1, (10, 12), 7>
- <1, (10, 15), 11, 12>
- <1, (1, 12), 6, 7>
