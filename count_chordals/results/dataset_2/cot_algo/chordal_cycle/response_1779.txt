Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 7, 0) with edges (5, 4), (4, 7), (7, 0), (0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 10, 9, 1) with edges (5, 10), (10, 9), (9, 1), (1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 11, 7, 4) with edges (5, 11), (11, 7), (7, 4), (4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (0, 12, 2, 4) with edges (0, 12), (12, 2), (2, 4), (4, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 12, 6, 8) with edges (0, 12), (12, 6), (6, 8), (8, 0)
- Cycle 6: (8, 5, 1, 9) with edges (8, 5), (5, 1), (1, 9), (9, 8)
- Cycle 7: (8, 6, 7, 13) with edges (8, 6), (6, 7), (7, 13), (13, 8)
- Cycle 8: (10, 0, 7, 11) with edges (10, 0), (0, 7), (7, 11), (11, 10)
- Cycle 9: (10, 9, 1, 11) with edges (10, 9), (9, 1), (1, 11), (11, 10)
- Cycle 10: (13, 1, 4, 14) with edges (13, 1), (1, 4), (4, 14), (14, 13)
- Cycle 11: (13, 12, 6, 7) with edges (13, 12), (12, 6), (6, 7), (7, 13)
- Cycle 12: (13, 7, 4, 14) with edges (13, 7), (7, 4), (4, 14), (14, 13)
- Cycle 13: (14, 3, 12, 2) with edges (14, 3), (3, 12), (12, 2), (2, 14)
- Cycle 14: (14, 4, 1, 5) with edges (14, 4), (4, 1), (1, 5), (5, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has a chord (4, 0)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (10, 5)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (11, 4)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (12, 4)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (12, 0)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (8, 1)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (0, 10)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (13, 4)
- Cycle 11 has a chord (7, 6)
- Cycle 12 has a chord (7, 13)
- Cycle 13 has a chord (3, 12)
- Cycle 14 has a chord (1, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are a total of 14 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [14].
The chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, 4, 7, 0>, <5, 10, 9, 1>, <5, 11, 7, 4>, <0, 12, 2, 4>, <0, 12, 6, 8>, <8, 5, 1, 9>, <8, 6, 7, 13>, <10, 0, 7, 11>, <10, 9, 1, 11>, <13, 1, 4, 14>, <13, 12, 6, 7>, <13, 7, 4, 14>, <14, 3, 12, 2>, <14, 4, 1, 5>
