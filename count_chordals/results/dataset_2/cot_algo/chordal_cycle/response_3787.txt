Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <4, 7, 0, 1>
- <4, 7, 3, 8>
- <4, 5, 2, 9>
- <7, 6, 9, 4>
- <7, 9, 8, 6>
- <6, 9, 2, 5>
- <6, 8, 1, 4>
- <9, 8, 5, 2>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <4, 7, 0, 1, (4, 7)>
- <4, 7, 3, 8, (4, 8)>
- <4, 5, 2, 9, (4, 9)>
- <7, 6, 9, 4, (6, 7)>
- <7, 9, 8, 6, (7, 8)>
- <6, 9, 2, 5, (6, 9)>
- <6, 8, 1, 4, (6, 8)>
- <9, 8, 5, 2, (8, 9)>

Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].
