Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 19) (6, 16) (6, 8) (10, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 13) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 18) (13, 7) (15, 8) (15, 7) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 13) (7, 15) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 3) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 14) (3, 0) (3, 12) (19, 9) (19, 0) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 12, 17, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 18, 13, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 5, 9, 18, 2>
- Cycle 4: <4, 11, 14, 1, 4>
- Cycle 5: <5, 9, 18, 13, 5>
- Cycle 6: <6, 8, 16, 0, 6>
- Cycle 7: <7, 13, 18, 4, 7>
- Cycle 8: <8, 12, 1, 14, 8>
- Cycle 9: <9, 18, 13, 7, 9>
- Cycle 10: <10, 11, 14, 18, 10>
- Cycle 11: <11, 14, 18, 13, 11>
- Cycle 12: <12, 17, 0, 16, 12>
- Cycle 13: <13, 18, 9, 5, 13>
- Cycle 14: <14, 18, 9, 5, 14>
- Cycle 15: <15, 7, 13, 18, 15>
- Cycle 16: <16, 0, 3, 12, 16>
- Cycle 17: <17, 0, 16, 8, 17>
- Cycle 18: <18, 4, 11, 10, 18>
- Cycle 19: <19, 0, 17, 4, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (3, 17), 12, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (4, 18), 13, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, (5, 9), 18, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (11, 14), 1, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (9, 18), 13, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (8, 16), 0, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (13, 18), 4, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (12, 1), 14, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (13, 18), 5, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (11, 14), 18, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <11, (14, 18), 13, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <12, (17, 0), 16, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <13, (18, 9), 5, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <14, (18, 9), 5, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <15, (7, 13), 18, 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <16, (0, 3), 12, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <17, (0, 16), 8, 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <18, (4, 11), 10, 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <19, (0, 17), 4, 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 19 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [19].
