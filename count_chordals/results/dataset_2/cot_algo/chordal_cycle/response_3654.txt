        - Cycle 3: 4-5-10-14-4
        - Cycle 4: 7-3-6-9-7
        - Cycle 5: 7-1-11-13-7
        - Cycle 6: 3-14-13-0-3
        - Cycle 7: 8-13-11-1-8
        - Cycle 8: 8-2-6-9-8

        - Cycle 20: 0-5-10-7-0
        - Cycle 21: 12-4-10-14-12
        - Cycle 22: 12-8-2-6-12
        - Cycle 23: 12-9-6-3-12
        - Cycle 24: 12-5-4-7-12

        - Cycle 27: 14-3-6-2-14
        - Cycle 28: 10-4-8-2-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <4, 7, 1, 10> has chord (7, 1)
        - <4, 8, 2, 6> has chord (8, 6)
        - <4, 5, 10, 14> has chord (5, 14)
        - <7, 3, 6, 9> has chord (3, 9)
        - <7, 1, 11, 13> has chord (1, 13)
        - <3, 14, 13, 0> has chord (14, 0)
        - <8, 13, 11, 1> has chord (13, 11)
        - <8, 2, 6, 9> has chord (2, 9)
        - <13, 14, 10, 5> has chord (14, 10)
        - <6, 3, 1, 7> has chord (3, 7)
        - <6, 2, 8, 4> has chord (2, 4)
        - <6, 5, 0, 9> has chord (5, 9)
        - <9, 6, 2, 8> has chord (6, 8)
        - <9, 12, 4, 5> has chord (12, 5)
        - <5, 4, 12, 2> has chord (4, 2)
        - <5, 10, 14, 3> has chord (10, 3)
        - <2, 8, 13, 0> has chord (8, 13)
        - <0, 13, 11, 1> has chord (13, 1)
        - <0, 9, 6, 3> has chord (9, 3)
        - <0, 5, 10, 7> has chord (5, 10)
        - <12, 4, 10, 14> has chord (4, 10)
        - <12, 8, 2, 6> has chord (8, 6)
