Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 15) (1, 20) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 27) (7, 21) (7, 20) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 22) (10, 6) (10, 17) (10, 27) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 27) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 16) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 22) (8, 18) (29, 5) (24, 6) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 15) (16, 4) (16, 28) (16, 15) (28, 16) (28, 13) (28, 18) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 20) (12, 17) (12, 2) (2, 12) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 25) (22, 21) (22, 8) (22, 2) (11, 14) (11, 25) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 5) (23, 21) (23, 10) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 5) (15, 9) (15, 26) (15, 16) (15, 0) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 19) (27, 3) (27, 10) (27, 17) (18, 8) (18, 28) (18, 14) (18, 13) (25, 2) (25, 11) (13, 28) (13, 2) (13, 18) (5, 21) (5, 29) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
<6, 21, 7, 20, 1> with chord (6, 20)
<6, 24, 26, 15, 9> with chord (6, 15)
<6, 10, 17, 12, 2> with chord (6, 12)
<6, 10, 17, 27, 3> with chord (6, 27)
<6, 10, 23, 21, 7> with chord (6, 21)
<6, 21, 23, 10, 17> with chord (6, 10)
<6, 21, 23, 10, 27> with chord (6, 10)
<6, 21, 22, 8, 9> with chord (6, 9)
<6, 10, 27, 17, 12> with chord (6, 17)
<6, 21, 22, 2, 12> with chord (6, 12)
<6, 21, 22, 2, 13> with chord (6, 22)
<6, 10, 17, 27, 3> with chord (6, 17)
<6, 10, 23, 21, 22> with chord (6, 21)
...
(There are additional cycles present as well, but we will focus on the ones that form chordal 4-cycles)

Step 2:
- The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<6, 21, 7, 20, 1> with chord (6, 20)
<6, 24, 26, 15, 9> with chord (6, 15)
<6, 10, 17, 12, 2> with chord (6, 12)
<6, 10, 17, 27, 3> with chord (6, 27)
...

Step 3:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [4].
