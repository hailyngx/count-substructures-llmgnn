Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (6, 9, 1, 6)
- (6, 9, 0, 6)
- (6, 9, 2, 8)
- (6, 13, 11, 7)
- (6, 13, 5, 8)
- (6, 13, 4, 14)
- (6, 5, 12, 0)
- (6, 5, 4, 13)
- (6, 5, 8, 2)
- (6, 4, 14, 1)
- (6, 4, 5, 8)
- (6, 4, 13, 5)
- (6, 12, 3, 10)
- (6, 12, 0, 9)
- (6, 12, 5, 8)
- (6, 1, 9, 0)
- (6, 1, 14, 4)
- (6, 1, 10, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
<6, 9, 1, (14, 4), 6>
<6, 13, 4, (5, 8), 6>
<6, 5, 12, (0, 9), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [3].
