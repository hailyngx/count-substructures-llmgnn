Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 3, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 5, 6, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 5, 0, 9)
- Cycle 5: (4, 1, 7, 4)
- Cycle 6: (7, 0, 8, 7)
- Cycle 7: (6, 5, 9, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 4, 1, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 7, 0, 6)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 5) <(9, 5)>
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 3, 5) <(9, 5)>
- Cycle 3: (9, 5, 6, 9) <(5, 9)>
- Cycle 4: (9, 5, 0, 9) <(5, 9)>
- Cycle 5: (4, 1, 7, 4) <(1, 7)>
- Cycle 6: (7, 0, 8, 7) <(0, 8)>
- Cycle 7: (6, 5, 9, 6) <(5, 9)>
- Cycle 8: (6, 5, 2, 6) <(5, 2)>
- Cycle 9: (6, 4, 1, 6) <(4, 1)>
- Cycle 10: (6, 7, 0, 6) <(7, 0)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
