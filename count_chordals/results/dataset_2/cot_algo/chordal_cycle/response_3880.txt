Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-7-6-3
- Cycle 2: 4-8-7-5
- Cycle 3: 4-8-9-2

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 (1-7-6-3): Chord <1, 6>
- Cycle 2 (4-8-7-5): Chord <4, 7>
- Cycle 3 (4-8-9-2): Chord <4, 9>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
