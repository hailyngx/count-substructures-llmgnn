Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 10) (15, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 4) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 0) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 9) (12, 3) (12, 18) (7, 3) (7, 18) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 0) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (3, 7, 8, 9, 15, 10)
- Cycle 2: (3, 7, 18, 2, 17, 14)
- Cycle 3: (3, 12, 18, 2, 16, 14)
- Cycle 4: (15, 9, 19, 17, 14, 11)
- Cycle 5: (15, 10, 4, 17, 14, 16)
- Cycle 6: (8, 9, 19, 18, 2, 5)
- Cycle 7: (8, 7, 18, 2, 16, 0)
- Cycle 8: (11, 14, 17, 2, 18, 19)
- Cycle 9: (11, 13, 0, 16, 2, 17)
- Cycle 10: (8, 7, 3, 12, 18, 2)
- Cycle 11: (8, 6, 13, 0, 16, 14)
- Cycle 12: (4, 10, 15, 9, 8, 7)
- Cycle 13: (4, 17, 14, 11, 13, 6)
- Cycle 14: (0, 4, 17, 2, 18, 12)
- Cycle 15: (0, 13, 11, 14, 17, 2)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (10, 15), 0>
- <2, (17, 4), 3>
- <3, (12, 18), 16>
- <4, (11, 14), 17>
- <5, (8, 9), 19>
- <6, (7, 18), 16>
- <7, (13, 6), 0>
- <8, (9, 15), 10>
- <9, (14, 17), 2>
- <10, (16, 2), 17>
- <11, (18, 2), 19>
- <12, (0, 4), 17>
- <13, (11, 14), 2>
- <14, (16, 0), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 4 chordless 4-cycles, so the final count is [4].
