Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 11) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 6-9-10-8-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-11-7-6
- Cycle 3: 8-10-4-12-8
- Cycle 4: 9-10-4-0-9
- Cycle 5: 9-10-14-0-9
- Cycle 6: 6-9-3-13-6
- Cycle 7: 6-9-3-11-6
- Cycle 8: 8-10-14-13-8
- Cycle 9: 8-10-14-0-8
- Cycle 10: 3-13-14-6-3
- Cycle 11: 3-13-14-0-3
- Cycle 12: 10-8-1-7-10
- Cycle 13: 10-14-0-5-10
- Cycle 14: 10-14-13-2-10
- Cycle 15: 11-9-0-4-11
- Cycle 16: 11-9-0-5-11
- Cycle 17: 11-9-1-7-11
- Cycle 18: 12-8-1-7-12
- Cycle 19: 12-8-10-4-12

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, (9, 10), 8>
- <6, (9, 11), 7>
- <8, (10, 4), 12>
- <9, (10, 4), 0>
- <9, (10, 14), 0>
- <6, (9, 3), 13>
- <6, (9, 3), 11>
- <8, (10, 14), 13>
- <8, (10, 14), 0>
- <3, (13, 14), 6>
- <3, (13, 14), 0>
- <10, (8, 1), 7>
- <10, (14, 0), 5>
- <10, (14, 13), 2>
- <11, (9, 0), 4>
- <11, (9, 0), 5>
- <11, (9, 1), 7>
- <12, (8, 1), 7>
- <12, (8, 10), 4>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 19 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [19].
