- The cycle 2 <1, 3, 8, 5> has one chord: (3, 8)
- The cycle 3 <1, 4, 5, 8> has one chord: (4, 8)
- The cycle 4 <1, 10, 6, 14> has one chord: (10, 14)
- The cycle 5 <1, 10, 7, 13> has one chord: (10, 13)
- The cycle 6 <2, 9, 13, 7> has one chord: (9, 7)
- The cycle 7 <2, 9, 11, 4> has one chord: (9, 11)
- The cycle 8 <2, 12, 6, 14> has one chord: (12, 14)
- The cycle 9 <2, 12, 1, 3> has one chord: (12, 1)
- The cycle 10 <3, 10, 7, 13> has one chord: (10, 7)
- The cycle 11 <3, 10, 0, 14> has one chord: (10, 14)
- The cycle 12 <3, 13, 7, 10> has one chord: (13, 10)
- The cycle 13 <4, 11, 2, 9> has one chord: (11, 9)
- The cycle 14 <4, 11, 1, 3> has one chord: (11, 1)
- The cycle 15 <4, 14, 6, 12> has one chord: (14, 6)
- The cycle 16 <5, 8, 2, 9> has one chord: (8, 9)
- The cycle 17 <6, 14, 13, 7> has one chord: (14, 13)
- The cycle 18 <8, 2, 9, 13> has one chord: (2, 13)
- The cycle 19 <10, 6, 12, 2> has one chord: (6, 12)
- The cycle 20 <10, 7, 13, 9> has one chord: (7, 9)
- The cycle 21 <11, 9, 13, 7> has one chord: (9, 13)
- The cycle 22 <12, 6, 10, 7> has one chord: (6, 10)
- The cycle 23 <13, 7, 10, 3> has one chord: (7, 10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 23 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the total number of chordal 4-cycles is [23].
