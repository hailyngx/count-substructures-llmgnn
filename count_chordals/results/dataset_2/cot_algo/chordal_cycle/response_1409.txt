Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (1-11), 18, 8>: Chord: (1-11)
- <1, (1-8), 18, 11>: Chord: (1-8)
- <1, (1-18), 8, 11>: Chord: (1-18)
- <1, (1-8), 11, 18>: Chord: (1-8)
- <3, (3-10), 18, 5>: Chord: (3-10)
- <3, (3-18), 10, 5>: Chord: (3-18)
- <10, (10-0), 9, 3>: Chord: (10-0)
- <10, (10-9), 0, 3>: Chord: (10-9)
- <8, (8-19), 14, 1>: Chord: (8-19)
- <13, (13-9), 6, 12>: Chord: (13-9)
- <17, (17-19), 18, 9>: Chord: (17-19)
- <4, (4-5), 6, 19>: Chord: (4-5)
- <18, (18-3), 17, 1>: Chord: (18-3)
- <18, (18-17), 3, 1>: Chord: (18-17)
- <19, (19-17), 4, 8>: Chord: (19-17)
- <7, (7-6), 14, 16>: Chord: (7-6)
- <0, (0-6), 10, 13>: Chord: (0-6)
- <12, (12-19), 5, 13>: Chord: (12-19)
- <15, (15-2), 5, 19>: Chord: (15-2)
- <2, (2-15), 5, 12>: Chord: (2-15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are 19 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [19].
