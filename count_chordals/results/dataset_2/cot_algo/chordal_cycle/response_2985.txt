Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 5) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 12) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 3) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 10, 11, 1) with chords (10, 11)
- Cycle 2: (7, 5, 11, 10) with chords (5, 11)
- Cycle 3: (8, 9, 10, 11) with chords (9, 10)
- Cycle 4: (8, 13, 4, 10) with chords (13, 10)
- Cycle 5: (13, 5, 11, 10) with chords (5, 11)
- Cycle 6: (6, 13, 4, 10) with chords (6, 10)
- Cycle 7: (2, 5, 11, 10) with chords (5, 11)
- Cycle 8: (2, 6, 13, 4) with chords (6, 4)
- Cycle 9: (0, 11, 1, 14) with chords (11, 1)
- Cycle 10: (0, 6, 13, 4) with chords (6, 4)
- Cycle 11: (0, 14, 7, 5) with chords (14, 7)
- Cycle 12: (3, 11, 1, 14) with chords (11, 1)
- Cycle 13: (3, 7, 5, 11) with chords (7, 11)
- Cycle 14: (3, 0, 6, 13) with chords (0, 13)
- Cycle 15: (3, 12, 8, 9) with chords (12, 8)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for one chord:
- Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
    - <4, 10, 11, 1> with chords (10, 11)
    - <7, 5, 11, 10> with chords (5, 11)
    - <8, 9, 10, 11> with chords (9, 10)
    - <8, 13, 4, 10> with chords (13, 10)
    - <13, 5, 11, 10> with chords (5, 11)
    - <6, 13, 4, 10> with chords (6, 10)
    - <2, 5, 11, 10> with chords (5, 11)
    - <2, 6, 13, 4> with chords (6, 4)
    - <0, 11, 1, 14> with chords (11, 1)
    - <3, 11, 1, 14> with chords (11, 1)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [10].
