Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-7-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-4-7-9-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-8-4-1
- Cycle 4: 1-5-2-6-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-2-7-1
- Cycle 6: 1-6-0-3-1
- Cycle 7: 4-5-2-7-4
- Cycle 8: 4-5-8-1-4
- Cycle 9: 4-7-2-5-4
- Cycle 10: 4-7-6-1-4

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (5, 9), 7, 4, (1, 9)> - Chordal 4-cycle
- <1, (5, 4), 7, 9, (1, 4)> - Chordal 4-cycle
- <1, (5, 8), 4, (1, 8)> - Chordal 4-cycle
- <1, (2, 6), 7, (1, 6)> - Chordal 4-cycle
- <1, (2, 7), 6, (1, 2)> - Chordal 4-cycle
- <1, (0, 3), 6, (1, 3)> - Chordal 4-cycle
- <4, (5, 2), 7, (4, 7)> - Chordal 4-cycle
- <4, (5, 8), 1, (4, 8)> - Chordal 4-cycle
- <4, (7, 2), 5, (4, 2)> - Chordal 4-cycle
- <4, (6, 1), 7, (4, 6)> - Chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore [10].
