Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-6-2-0
- Cycle 2: 1-5-9-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-8-9-1
- Cycle 4: 1-0-8-9-1
- Cycle 5: 1-2-6-3-1

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (0, 6)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (0, 9)
- Cycle 5 has no chords

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 2, 6, 3> (chord: (0, 6))
<1, 2, 6, 3> (chord: (5, 9))
<1, 4, 8, 9> (chord: (4, 8))
<0, 1, 8, 9> (chord: (0, 9))
