Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: {4, 7, 6, 1, 4}
- Cycle 2: {4, 1, 9, 3, 4}
- Cycle 3: {4, 3, 6, 7, 4}
- Cycle 4: {4, 7, 9, 2, 4}
- Cycle 5: {7, 6, 3, 9, 7}
- Cycle 6: {7, 6, 2, 4, 7}
- Cycle 7: {6, 1, 3, 9, 6}
- Cycle 8: {1, 3, 6, 7, 1}
- Cycle 9: {1, 4, 8, 5, 1}
- Cycle 10: {3, 1, 9, 2, 3}
- Cycle 11: {3, 6, 9, 1, 3}
- Cycle 12: {8, 4, 1, 7, 8}
- Cycle 13: {8, 5, 2, 4, 8}
- Cycle 14: {5, 2, 9, 1, 5}
- Cycle 15: {5, 0, 6, 2, 5}
- Cycle 16: {0, 1, 4, 7, 0}

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (6, 7), 4>
- Cycle 2: <1, (3, 9), 4>
- Cycle 3: <4, (3, 7), 6>
- Cycle 4: <4, (7, 9), 2>
- Cycle 5: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 6: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 7: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 8: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 9: <1, (8, 5), 4>
- Cycle 10: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 11: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 12: <1, (4, 7), 8>
- Cycle 13: <8, (2, 4), 5>
- Cycle 14: <5, (1, 9), 2>
- Cycle 15: <5, (6, 2), 0>
- Cycle 16: <0, (4, 7), 1>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

So, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (6, 7), 4>
- <1, (3, 9), 4>
- <4, (3, 7), 6>
- <4, (7, 9), 2>
- <1, (8, 5), 4>
- <8, (2, 4), 5>
