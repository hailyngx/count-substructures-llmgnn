Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-1-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-9-1-5-0
- Cycle 3: 1-9-0-6-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-0-7-1
- Cycle 5: 2-4-7-3-2
- Cycle 6: 2-4-7-1-2
- Cycle 7: 3-1-9-6-3
- Cycle 8: 3-1-9-0-3
- Cycle 9: 4-7-1-9-4
- Cycle 10: 5-1-9-0-5
- Cycle 11: 6-0-9-1-6
- Cycle 12: 6-0-9-0-6
- Cycle 13: 7-1-9-0-7
- Cycle 14: 8-0-9-1-8
- Cycle 15: 8-0-9-0-8
- Cycle 16: 8-2-4-7-8
- Cycle 17: 8-2-4-5-8
- Cycle 18: 8-2-4-1-8
- Cycle 19: 8-3-1-9-8

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (9, 3), 0>
- Cycle 2: <2, (7, 1), 5>
- Cycle 4: <4, (0, 9), 7>
- Cycle 6: <6, (4, 7), 1>
- Cycle 8: <8, (0, 9), 3>
- Cycle 16: <16, (2, 7), 4>
- Cycle 19: <19, (1, 9), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [12]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<1, (9, 3), 0>
<2, (7, 1), 5>
<4, (0, 9), 7>
<6, (4, 7), 1>
<8, (0, 9), 3>
<16, (2, 7), 4>
<19, (1, 9),  8>
