Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (7, 1) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-4-10-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-14-0-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-9-8-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-11-12-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-0-10-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: 4-10
- Cycle 2 has a chord: 14-0
- Cycle 3 has a chord: 9-8
- Cycle 4 has a chord: 11-12
- Cycle 5 has a chord: 6-10

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are no chordless cycles found in this graph, so the final answer is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <1, 4, 10, 5>
- <1, 14, 0, 3>
- <1, 9, 8, 3>
- <1, 11, 12, 3>
- <1, 6, 10, 0>
