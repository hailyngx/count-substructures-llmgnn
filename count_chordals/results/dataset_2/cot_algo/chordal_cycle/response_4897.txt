Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-6-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-9-5-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-6-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-3-7-5-0

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 (0-1-6-3-0): Chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 2 (0-1-9-5-0): Chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 3 (0-3-6-2-0): Chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 4 (0-3-7-5-0): Chord (3, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 1, 3, 6, 0> with chord (1, 3)
- <0, 1, 9, 5, 0> with chord (1, 5)
- <0, 3, 6, 2, 0> with chord (3, 6)
- <0, 3, 7, 5, 0> with chord (3, 7)
