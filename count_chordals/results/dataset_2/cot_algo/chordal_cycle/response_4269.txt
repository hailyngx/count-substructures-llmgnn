Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 8-13-5-2-8
- Cycle 2: 8-13-9-10-4-8
- Cycle 3: 11-3-7-1-11
- Cycle 4: 4-11-3-7-4
- Cycle 5: 0-1-2-5-0
- Cycle 6: 0-1-11-4-6-0
- Cycle 7: 0-1-9-3-7-0
- Cycle 8: 0-6-14-8-13-0

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (5, 13), 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (8, 5), 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (8, 10), 11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, (3, 11), 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <8, (0, 14), 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, (0, 9), 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <10, (4, 10), 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <11, (1, 11), 3)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have a total of [8].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (5, 13), 2)>
- <2, (8, 5), 13)>
- <4, (8, 10), 11)>
- <7, (3, 11), 4)>
- <8, (0, 14), 13)>
- <9, (0, 9), 1)>
- <10, (4, 10), 9)>
- <11, (1, 11), 3)>
