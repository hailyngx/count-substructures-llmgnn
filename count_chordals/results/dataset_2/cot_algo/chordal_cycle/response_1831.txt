Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 14) (17, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 7) (8, 15) (12, 9) (12, 19) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 15) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 5) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 13) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 16, 4, 19, 1)
- (2, 7, 4, 19, 2)
- (2, 7, 15, 8, 2)
- (3, 16, 4, 7, 3)
- (3, 16, 19, 18, 3)
- (3, 16, 1, 10, 3)
- (3, 16, 4, 1, 3)
- (4, 7, 2, 15, 4)
- (4, 7, 15, 8, 4)
- (4, 16, 19, 18, 4)
- (4, 16, 3, 1, 4)
- (4, 19, 16, 3, 4)
- (5, 3, 16, 4, 5)
- (5, 15, 8, 7, 5)
- (5, 15, 2, 7, 5)
- (7, 4, 16, 3, 7)
- (7, 15, 2, 5, 7)
- (8, 7, 15, 2, 8)
- (10, 1, 16, 3, 10)
- (10, 18, 9, 4, 10)
- (11, 10, 1, 16, 11)
- (13, 0, 3, 16, 13)
- (13, 18, 19, 4, 13)
- (14, 3, 16, 19, 14)
- (15, 2, 7, 4, 15)
- (15, 5, 3, 16, 15)
- (16, 3, 1, 10, 16)
- (16, 4, 19, 18, 16)
- (16, 13, 0, 3, 16)
- (17, 10, 1, 16, 17)
- (18, 9, 4, 7, 18)
- (18, 10, 1, 16, 18)
- (18, 13, 0, 3, 18)
- (19, 4, 16, 3, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (16, 4), 19>
- <2, (7, 15), 8>
- <3, (16, 1), 10>
- <4, (7, 15), 8>
- <5, (3, 16), 4>
- <7, (15, 2), 5>
- <10, (1, 16), 11>
- <13, (0, 3), 16>
- <18, (9, 4), 10>
- <19, (4, 16), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles is [10].
