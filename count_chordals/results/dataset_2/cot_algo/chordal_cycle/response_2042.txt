Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 6) (26, 8) (26, 17) (13, 25) (13, 23) (22, 19) (22, 28) (22, 0) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 12) (8, 26) (8, 2) (28, 22) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 14) (28, 18) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 5) (29, 11) (4, 24) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 21) (15, 18) (15, 20) (15, 7) (20, 15) (20, 10) (20, 16) (2, 8) (2, 1) (11, 28) (11, 29) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 21) (1, 2) (1, 0) (17, 26) (17, 6) (17, 21) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 23) (7, 15) (7, 0) (23, 13) (23, 11) (23, 0) (23, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (19, 22) (19, 29) (5, 29) (5, 18) (5, 23) (16, 20) (16, 24) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 10) (3, 14) (3, 27) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 3) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 17) (25, 13) (25, 10) (10, 20) (10, 12) (10, 24) (10, 25) (10, 27) (27, 3) (27, 10) 

Response:
Adding the given edges to the graph yields the following adjacency list for each node:

Node 0: 22, 11, 1, 7, 23  
Node 1: 2, 0  
Node 2: 8, 1  
Node 3: 14, 27  
Node 4: 24  
Node 5: 29, 18, 23  
Node 6: 26, 14, 17, 12  
Node 7: 15, 0  
Node 8: 26, 2  
Node 9: 26, 21  
Node 10: 20, 12, 24, 25, 27  
Node 11: 28, 29, 23, 0, 21  
Node 12: 6, 10  
Node 13: 25, 23  
Node 14: 6, 28, 3  
Node 15: 18, 20, 7  
Node 16: 20, 24  
Node 17: 26, 6, 21  
Node 18: 28, 5, 15, 21  
Node 19: 22, 29  
Node 20: 15, 10, 16  
Node 21: 9, 18, 11, 17  
Node 22: 19, 28, 0  
Node 23: 13, 11, 0, 5  
Node 24: 4, 16, 10  
Node 25: 13, 10  
Node 26: 9, 6, 8, 17  
Node 27: 3, 10  
Node 28: 22, 29, 11, 14, 18  
Node 29: 28, 19, 5, 11  

Now, let's determine the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
