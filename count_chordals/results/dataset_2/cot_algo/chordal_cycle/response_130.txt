4. (6, 2, 4, 6)
5. (9, 8, 0, 9)
6. (9, 4, 7, 9)
7. (9, 1, 7, 9)
8. (9, 6, 4, 9)
9. (4, 7, 0, 4)
10. (4, 0, 9, 4)
11. (7, 9, 6, 7)
12. (7, 4, 0, 7)
13. (7, 0, 9, 7)

2. Cycle (6, 9, 7, 6) has exactly one chord: (9, 7) => <(9, 7), (6, 7), 6)>
3. Cycle (6, 4, 7, 6) has exactly one chord: (4, 7) => <(4, 7), (6, 7), 6)>
4. Cycle (6, 2, 4, 6) has exactly one chord: (2, 4) => <(2, 4), (6, 4), 6)>
5. Cycle (9, 8, 0, 9) has exactly one chord: (8, 0) => <(8, 0), (9, 0), 9)>
6. Cycle (9, 4, 7, 9) has exactly one chord: (4, 7) => <(4, 7), (9, 7), 9)>
7. Cycle (9, 1, 7, 9) has exactly one chord: (1, 7) => <(1, 7), (9, 7), 9)>
8. Cycle (6, 4, 7, 6) has exactly one chord: (4, 7) => <(4, 7), (6, 7), 6)>
9. Cycle (4, 7, 0, 4) has exactly one chord: (7, 0) => <(7, 0), (4, 0), 4)>
10. Cycle (4, 0, 9, 4) has exactly one chord: (0, 9) => <(0, 9), (4, 9), 4)>
11. Cycle (7, 9, 6, 7) has exactly one chord: (9, 6) => <(9, 6), (7, 6), 7)>
12. Cycle (7, 4, 0, 7) has exactly one chord: (4, 0) => <(4, 0), (7, 0), 7)>
13. Cycle (7, 0, 9, 7) has exactly one chord: (0, 9) => <(0, 9), (7, 9), 7)>
14. Cycle (2, 6, 4, 2) has exactly one chord: (6, 4) => <(6, 4), (2, 4), 2)>
15. Cycle (8, 9, 4, 8) has exactly one chord: (9, 4) => <(9, 4), (8, 4), 8)>
16. Cycle (8, 0, 7, 8) has exactly one chord: (0, 7) => <(0, 7), (8, 7), 8)>
17. Cycle (0, 9, 6, 0) has exactly one chord: (9, 6) => <(9, 6), (0, 6), 0)>
18. Cycle (0, 4, 7, 0) has exactly one chord: (4, 7) => <(4, 7), (0, 7), 0)>
19. Cycle (1, 9, 6, 1) has exactly one chord: (9, 6) => <(9, 6), (1, 6), 1)>
20. Cycle (1, 7, 0, 1) has exactly one chord: (7, 0) => <(7, 0), (1, 0), 1)>
21. Cycle (3, 6, 4, 3) has exactly one chord: (6, 4) => <(6, 4), (3, 4), 3)>
22. Cycle (3, 7, 0, 3) has exactly one chord: (7, 0) => <(7, 0), (3, 0), 3)>
23. Cycle (5, 4, 7, 5) has exactly one chord: (4, 7) => <(4, 7), (5, 7), 5)>
24. Cycle (5, 1, 7, 5) has exactly one chord: (1, 7) => <(1, 7), (5, 7), 5)>
