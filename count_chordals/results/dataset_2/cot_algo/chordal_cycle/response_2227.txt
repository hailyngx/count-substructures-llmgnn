Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-7-0-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-9-1-4-5
        - Cycle 3: 5-4-3-1-5
        - Cycle 4: 5-4-0-9-5
        - Cycle 5: 9-1-3-4-9
        - Cycle 6: 9-1-5-6-9
        - Cycle 7: 9-7-0-8-9
        - Cycle 8: 4-1-3-6-4
        - Cycle 9: 7-9-0-8-7
        - Cycle 10: 1-5-6-3-1

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - In cycle 1, there is 1 chord: (9, 0)
        - In cycle 2, there is 1 chord: (9, 1)
        - In cycle 3, there is 1 chord: (4, 1)
        - In cycle 4, there is 1 chord: (4, 9)
        - In cycle 5, there is 1 chord: (1, 4)
        - In cycle 6, there is 1 chord: (1, 5)
        - In cycle 7, there is 1 chord: (9, 8)
        - In cycle 8, there is 1 chord: (1, 3)
        - In cycle 9, there is 1 chord: (9, 0)
        - In cycle 10, there is 1 chord: (5, 3)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
        There are 10 chordal 4-cycles.

Final Answer: [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <5, (9, 0), 7>
        <5, (9, 1), 4>
        <5, (4, 1), 3>
        <5, (4, 9), 0>
        <9, (1, 4), 5>
        <9, (1, 5), 6>
        <9, (9, 8), 7>
        <1, (1, 3), 6>
        <7, (9, 0), 8>
        <1, (5, 3), 1>
