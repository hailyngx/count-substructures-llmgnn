Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 3, 9, 8, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 7, 3, 6, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 6, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 3, 6, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (3, 8)
  <1, (3, 8), 0>

- Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 6)
  <2, (1, 6), 0>

- Cycle 3 has one chord: (2, 6)
  <3, (2, 5), 0>

- Cycle 4 has one chord: (2, 7)
  <4, (2, 7), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [4].
