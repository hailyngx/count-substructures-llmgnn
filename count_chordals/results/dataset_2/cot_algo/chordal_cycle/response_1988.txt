Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 20) (11, 10) (11, 26) (8, 4) (8, 24) (23, 7) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 5) (4, 3) (28, 0) (28, 25) (28, 20) (29, 14) (29, 3) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 27) (2, 19) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 12) (6, 17) (6, 15) (21, 10) (21, 19) (15, 6) (15, 5) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 12) (26, 11) (26, 14) (26, 7) (1, 10) (1, 20) (1, 9) (1, 0) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 25) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 24) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 7) (19, 2) (19, 21) (19, 27) (20, 10) (20, 28) (20, 1) (20, 27) (0, 28) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 25) (0, 12) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 13) (27, 17) (27, 19) (27, 20) (27, 7) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 12) (12, 18) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 22) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 0) (7, 23) (7, 26) (7, 9) (7, 27) (22, 12) (3, 4) (3, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 1-10-21-19-2-0-1
- Cycle 2: 1-10-20-28-25-16-17-6-15-5-4-3-29-14-12-0-2-19-21

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.

Step 3:
Since both cycles do not have any chords, the number of chordless cycles found is 2.
Therefore, the final count is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 10, 21, 19>
<4, 5, 15, 6>
