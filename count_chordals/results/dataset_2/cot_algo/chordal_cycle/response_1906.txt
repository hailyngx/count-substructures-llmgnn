Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - 4-7-9-0-4
        - 4-7-8-0-4
        - 4-7-3-8-4
        - 4-5-1-6-4
        - 4-5-0-6-4
        - 4-1-6-2-4
        - 4-1-2-3-4
        - 4-2-3-7-4
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <4, (7, 9), 0>
        - <4, (7, 8), 0>
        - <4, (7, 3), 8>
        - <4, (5, 1), 6>
        - <4, (5, 0), 6>
        - <4, (1, 6), 2>
        - <4, (1, 2), 3>
        - <4, (2, 3), 7>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are a total of [8] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
