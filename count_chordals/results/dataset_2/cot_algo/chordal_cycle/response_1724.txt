Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 20) (13, 19) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 10) (3, 15) (3, 23) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 16) (15, 19) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 20) (2, 7) (29, 13) (29, 2) (29, 16) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 16) (25, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (21, 6) (21, 26) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 18) (18, 2) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 11) (0, 7) (0, 20) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 12) (28, 17) (28, 9) (28, 24) (9, 3) (9, 28) (6, 21) (6, 12) (5, 24) (5, 16) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 1) (16, 22) (16, 15) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 5) (1, 19) (1, 24) (27, 25) (27, 17) (17, 25) (17, 28) (17, 27) (26, 21) (24, 8) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 1) (10, 22) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 10) (12, 25) (12, 20) (12, 6) (12, 11) (23, 3) (23, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph, such as:
    - 13-29-2-20-13
    - 22-16-25-12-22
    - 3-15-16-29-3
    - 2-7-0-20-2
    - 25-16-29-2-25
    - 4-19-1-24-4
    - 18-8-24-5-18
    - 10-23-3-9-10

Step 2:
- Checking each of the above cycles for exactly one chord:
    - <13, (29, 2), 20>
    - <22, (16, 25), 12>
    - <3, (15, 16), 29>
    - <2, (7, 0), 20>
    - <25, (16, 29), 2>
    - <4, (19, 1), 24>
    - <18, (8, 24), 5>
    - <10, (23, 3), 9>

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we get [8].
