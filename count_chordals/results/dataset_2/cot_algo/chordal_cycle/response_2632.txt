Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-9-6
- Cycle 2: 4-7-5-8
- Cycle 3: 4-6-5-8
- Cycle 4: 4-6-9-2
- Cycle 5: 4-6-1-7
- Cycle 6: 4-1-7-9
- Cycle 7: 7-9-3-0
- Cycle 8: 7-9-2-6
- Cycle 9: 7-5-8-0
- Cycle 10: 6-1-7-9

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 <4, (7, 9), 6>
- Cycle 2 <4, (7, 5), 8>
- Cycle 3 <4, (6, 5), 8>
- Cycle 4 <4, (6, 9), 2>
- Cycle 5 <4, (6, 1), 7>
- Cycle 6 <4, (1, 7), 9>
- Cycle 7 <7, (9, 3), 0>
- Cycle 8 <7, (9, 2), 6>
- Cycle 9 <7, (5, 8), 0>
- Cycle 10 <6, (1, 7), 9>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
