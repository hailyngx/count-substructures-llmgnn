Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 13) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 22) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 5) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 16) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 22) (6, 18) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (9, 23) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 22) (8, 18) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 0) (5, 10) (17, 3) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 21) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 10) (26, 20) (28, 19) (28, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 27) (2, 20) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 21) (19, 28) (19, 20) (14, 22) (14, 27) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 14) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 19) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 24) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 13) (27, 9) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 14) (25, 11) (25, 5) (10, 5) (10, 1) (13, 11) (13, 28) (13, 18) (23, 6) (23, 9) (23, 21) (21, 29) (21, 24) (21, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 11-16-7-8-11
- Cycle 2: 11-25-5-15-3-24-11
- Cycle 3: 5-25-11-16-7-8-5
- Cycle 4: 9-6-22-8-7-16-11-13-28-19-20-26-2-9
- Cycle 5: 1-17-3-15-5-10-1
- Cycle 6: 27-9-6-5-25-0-24-21-29-17-27
- Cycle 7: 21-29-1-10-5-15-3-24-21
- Cycle 8: 23-21-24-0-12-4-8-22-14-27-23
- Cycle 9: 18-8-4-12-0-24-3-17-27-14-13-18

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find that Cycle 1 has one chord: (8, 16), Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 15), and Cycle 9 has one chord: (8, 24).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, there are [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (7, 8), 16)>
<11, (5, 15), 25)>
<18, (8, 24), 13)>
