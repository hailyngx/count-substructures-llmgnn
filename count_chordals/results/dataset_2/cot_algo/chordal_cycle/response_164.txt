Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 10) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 7, 4, 12, 5)
- Cycle 2: (8, 9, 1, 7, 11, 13, 8)
- Cycle 3: (8, 13, 2, 3, 14, 8)
- Cycle 4: (12, 4, 13, 11, 14, 12)
- Cycle 5: (10, 12, 6, 0, 13, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (8, 13)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (4, 13)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (12, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (1, 7), 4, 12, 5>
<2, (1, 7), 8, 13>
<3, (8, 13), 2, 14>
<4, (4, 13), 11, 12>
<5, (12, 6), 10, 13>
