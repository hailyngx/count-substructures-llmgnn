Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle <0, 7, 4, 6> (with edges (0, 7), (7, 4), (4, 6), (6, 0))
        - Cycle <0, 7, 6, 4> (with edges (0, 7), (7, 6), (6, 4), (4, 0))
        - Cycle <1, 6, 4, 8> (with edges (1, 6), (6, 4), (4, 8), (8, 1))
        - Cycle <1, 6, 4, 7> (with edges (1, 6), (6, 4), (4, 7), (7, 1))
        - Cycle <2, 7, 4, 8> (with edges (2, 7), (7, 4), (4, 8), (8, 2))
        - Cycle <2, 7, 6, 4> (with edges (2, 7), (7, 6), (6, 4), (4, 2))
        - Cycle <2, 7, 6, 1> (with edges (2, 7), (7, 6), (6, 1), (1, 2))
        - Cycle <2, 5, 4, 8> (with edges (2, 5), (5, 4), (4, 8), (8, 2))
        - Cycle <2, 5, 4, 7> (with edges (2, 5), (5, 4), (4, 7), (7, 2))
        - Cycle <3, 5, 4, 6> (with edges (3, 5), (5, 4), (4, 6), (6, 3))
        - Cycle <3, 5, 4, 7> (with edges (3, 5), (5, 4), (4, 7), (7, 3))
        - Cycle <3, 0, 7, 4> (with edges (3, 0), (0, 7), (7, 4), (4, 3))
        - Cycle <3, 0, 7, 6> (with edges (3, 0), (0, 7), (7, 6), (6, 3))

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle <0, 7, 4, 6> has one chord <0, 4>
        - Cycle <0, 7, 6, 4> has one chord <7, 4>
        - Cycle <1, 6, 4, 8> has one chord <1, 8>
        - Cycle <1, 6, 4, 7> has one chord <1, 7>
        - Cycle <2, 7, 6, 4> has one chord <2, 4>
        - Cycle <2, 5, 4, 8> has one chord <2, 8>
        - Cycle <3, 5, 4, 6> has one chord <3, 6>
        - Cycle <3, 0, 7, 6> has one chord <3, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - Chordless cycles: 12
        - Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [12].
