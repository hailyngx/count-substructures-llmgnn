Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-2-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-9-1-0
- Cycle 3: 2-5-3-2
- Cycle 4: 4-9-1-8-4
- Cycle 5: 4-9-5-3-4
- Cycle 6: 4-6-7-3-4
- Cycle 7: 6-7-4-8-6

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord 5-3
- Cycle 2 has one chord 9-1
- Cycle 3 has one chord 5-3
- Cycle 4 has one chord 9-1
- Cycle 5 has one chord 9-5
- Cycle 6 has one chord 7-3
- Cycle 7 has one chord 7-4

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 5, (2, 3), 0>
<0, 9, (1, 9), 0>
<2, 5, (3, 5), 2>
<4, 9, (1, 8), 4>
<4, 9, (5, 3), 4>
<4, 6, (7, 3), 4>
<6, 7, (4, 8), 6>
