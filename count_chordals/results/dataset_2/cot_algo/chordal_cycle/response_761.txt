Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 3, 8, 1, 6, 0> with 4 edges
- <0, 3, 4, 0> with 3 edges
- <0, 4, 3, 0> with 3 edges
- <0, 4, 3, 8, 1, 0> with 4 edges
- <0, 6, 1, 8, 3, 0> with 4 edges
- <0, 6, 2, 9, 1, 0> with 4 edges
- <0, 6, 5, 9, 1, 0> with 4 edges
- <0, 7, 9, 1, 0> with 4 edges
- <0, 9, 7, 3, 0> with 4 edges
- <0, 9, 8, 1, 0> with 4 edges
- <0, 9, 5, 6, 0> with 4 edges
- <1, 2, 6, 0, 3, 8, 1> with 5 edges
- <1, 2, 6, 5, 9, 1> with 4 edges
- <1, 6, 2, 8, 1> with 4 edges
- <1, 6, 5, 9, 1> with 4 edges
- <2, 6, 5, 9, 2> with 4 edges
- <3, 0, 4, 3> with 3 edges
- <3, 0, 6, 5, 9, 3> with 4 edges
- <3, 4, 0, 7, 3> with 4 edges
- <3, 4, 0, 9, 3> with 4 edges
- <3, 7, 0, 9, 3> with 4 edges
- <3, 8, 1, 6, 0, 3> with 5 edges
- <3, 8, 1, 9, 3> with 4 edges
- <4, 0, 3, 8, 4> with 4 edges
- <5, 6, 2, 9, 5> with 4 edges
- <5, 9, 0, 3, 8, 5> with 5 edges
- <6, 0, 3, 8, 1, 6> with 5 edges
- <6, 1, 2, 8, 6> with 4 edges
- <6, 5, 9, 1, 6> with 4 edges
- <7, 0, 3, 8, 1, 7> with 5 edges
- <7, 0, 4, 3, 7> with 4 edges
- <7, 3, 0, 9, 7> with 4 edges
- <8, 1, 6, 5, 9, 8> with 5 edges
- <9, 0, 3, 8, 1, 9> with 5 edges

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles are as follows:
- <0, (3, 8), 1, 6>
- <0, 4, (3, 8), 1>
- <0, 6, (1, 8), 3>
- <0, 6, (2, 9), 1>
- <0, 6, (5, 9), 1>
- <0, 7, (3, 9), 1>
- <0, 9, (1, 8), 3>
- <0, 9, (5, 6), 1>
- <1, 2, (6, 5), 9>
- <3, (0, 4), 7, 8>

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, thus the final count is [9].
