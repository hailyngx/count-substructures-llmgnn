Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 17) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 13) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 19) (13, 9) (13, 5) (19, 12) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 0) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 10) (14, 5) (10, 3) (10, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 5, 8, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 6, 9, 5, 16)
- Cycle 3: (11, 7, 3, 2, 11)
- Cycle 4: (16, 5, 9, 13, 16)
- Cycle 5: (16, 1, 18, 2, 16)
- Cycle 6: (3, 6, 9, 13, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 7, 8, 5, 3)
- Cycle 8: (15, 3, 2, 18, 15)
- Cycle 9: (6, 9, 13, 5, 6)
- Cycle 10: (9, 5, 8, 7, 9)
- Cycle 11: (5, 13, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 12: (2, 3, 7, 11, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 18, 1, 16, 2)
- Cycle 14: (18, 9, 6, 3, 18)
- Cycle 15: (4, 8, 7, 12, 4)
- Cycle 16: (8, 5, 16, 1, 8)
- Cycle 17: (7, 11, 1, 10, 7)
- Cycle 18: (7, 3, 15, 17, 7)
- Cycle 19: (12, 7, 3, 2, 12)
- Cycle 20: (13, 9, 6, 17, 13)
- Cycle 21: (19, 12, 7, 11, 19)
- Cycle 22: (17, 15, 3, 6, 17)
- Cycle 23: (1, 11, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 24: (1, 18, 2, 3, 1)
- Cycle 25: (14, 5, 9, 13, 14)
- Cycle 26: (10, 1, 16, 5, 10)
- Cycle 27: (0, 2, 3, 15, 0)
- Cycle 28: (0, 12, 7, 11, 0)
- Cycle 29: (0, 17, 15, 3, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (10, 16), 5>
- <9, (6, 13), 5>
- <3, (2, 7), 11>
- <1, (16, 18), 2>
- <7, (3, 15), 17>
- <8, (5, 16), 1>
- <7, (11, 1), 3>
- <5, (9, 13), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [8].
