Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph has the following unique chordal 4-cycle:

<3, 6, 7, 4> 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
