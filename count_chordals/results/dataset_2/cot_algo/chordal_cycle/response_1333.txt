Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 7) (16, 20) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 22) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 24) (0, 21) (27, 26) (27, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 3) (22, 5) (22, 23) (22, 10) (22, 20) (22, 3) (23, 22) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 28) (18, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 14) (26, 27) (26, 1) (21, 0) (28, 18) (28, 8) (28, 25) (28, 20) (17, 18) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 6) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 3) (13, 5) (24, 9) (24, 10) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 19) (20, 16) (20, 22) (20, 28) (20, 3) (10, 4) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 15) (10, 3) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (25, 28) (25, 17) (8, 11) (8, 27) (8, 28) (19, 4) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 6) (6, 16) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 29) (3, 20) (3, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 16, 6, 4)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 18, 2, 14, 12, 6, 16, 7, 4, 9, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 13, 24, 9, 4, 19, 29, 3, 22, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 22, 20, 16, 7, 4, 10, 15, 19, 29, 3, 22)
- Cycle 6: (9, 4, 10, 24, 9)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (6, 16) -> <1, (6, 16), 1>
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (5, 9) -> <2, (5, 9), 2>
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (2, 14) -> <3, (2, 14), 3>
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (13, 24) -> <4, (13, 24), 4>
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (20, 28) -> <5, (20, 28), 5>
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (4, 10) -> <6, (4, 10), 6>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
