Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 6)
- Cycle 2: (7, 8, 3, 6)
- Cycle 3: (4, 5, 9, 3)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 1, 4)
- Cycle 5: (2, 5, 9, 3)
- Cycle 6: (0, 9, 3, 6)
- Cycle 7: (0, 4, 1, 7)
- Cycle 8: (2, 9, 3, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, (3, 6), 4>: Chord (3, 6) connects non-adjacent nodes 3 and 6 in the cycle (5, 9, 3, 6).
- <2, (5, 3), 9>: Chord (5, 3) connects non-adjacent nodes 5 and 3 in the cycle (7, 8, 3, 6).
- <3, (9, 3), 5>: Chord (9, 3) connects non-adjacent nodes 9 and 3 in the cycle (4, 5, 9, 3).
- <4, (1, 7), 0>: Chord (1, 7) connects non-adjacent nodes 1 and 7 in the cycle (5, 7, 1, 4).
- <5, (9, 3), 2>: Chord (9, 3) connects non-adjacent nodes 9 and 3 in the cycle (2, 5, 9, 3).
- <6, (3, 6), 0>: Chord (3, 6) connects non-adjacent nodes 3 and 6 in the cycle (0, 9, 3, 6).
- <7, (1, 7), 4>: Chord (1, 7) connects non-adjacent nodes 1 and 7 in the cycle (0, 4, 1, 7).
- <8, (3, 8), 9>: Chord (3, 8) connects non-adjacent nodes 3 and 8 in the cycle (2, 9, 3, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].
