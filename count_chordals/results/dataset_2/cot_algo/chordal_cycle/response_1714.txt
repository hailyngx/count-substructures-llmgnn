- Cycle 26: (12, 4), (4, 9), (9, 11), (11, 12)
- Cycle 27: (2, 7), (7, 4), (4, 9), (9, 2)

- Cycle 29: (2, 10), (10, 9), (9, 14), (14, 2)
- Cycle 30: (11, 8), (8, 1), (1, 0), (0, 11)
- Cycle 31: (10, 3), (3, 7), (7, 4), (4, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (0, 13), 8)>
<2, (10, 7), 13)>
<3, (7, 4), 13)>
<4, (0, 9), 14)>
<5, (9, 10), 6)>
<6, (9, 10), 6)>
<7, (13, 0), 8)>
<8, (7, 4), 13)>
<9, (4, 9), 12)>
<10, (4, 9), 12)>
<11, (0, 13), 8)>
<12, (0, 9), 14)>
<13, (13, 0), 8)>
<14, (11, 8), 1)>
<15, (7, 4), 13)>
<16, (11, 8), 1)>
<17, (13, 0), 8)>
<18, (0, 13), 8)>
<19, (7, 4), 13)>
<20, (9, 10), 6)>
<21, (4, 9), 12)>
<22, (10, 7), 13)>
<23, (9, 10), 6)>
<24, (10, 7), 13)>
<25, (9, 10), 6)>
<26, (7, 4), 13)>
<27, (9, 10), 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 27 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [27].
