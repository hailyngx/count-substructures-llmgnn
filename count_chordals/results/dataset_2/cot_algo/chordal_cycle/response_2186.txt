Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (9, 1, 4, 7, 9)
- Cycle 2: (7, 1, 9, 3, 7)
- Cycle 3: (1, 9, 7, 4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 7, 8, 3)
- Cycle 5: (9, 7, 4, 1, 9)
- Cycle 6: (7, 4, 0, 5, 7)
- Cycle 7: (4, 0, 7, 1, 4)
- Cycle 8: (0, 7, 5, 3, 0)
- Cycle 9: (1, 7, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 10: (3, 9, 7, 1, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (4, 7), 9> - Chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 2: <1, (9, 3), 7> - Chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 3: <1, (7, 4), 9> - Chord: (7, 4)
- Cycle 4: <1, (7, 8), 3> - Chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 5: <1, (4, 7), 9> - Chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 6: <4, (5, 7), 0> - Chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 7: <4, (7, 1), 0> - Chord: (7, 1)
- Cycle 8: <7, (0, 5), 3> - Chord: (0, 5)
- Cycle 9: <1, (7, 9), 3> - Chord: (7, 9)
- Cycle 10: <1, (7, 3), 9> - Chord: (7, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
