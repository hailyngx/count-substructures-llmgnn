Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 17) (15, 16) (13, 14) (13, 17) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 4) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 6) (6, 14) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (18, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (0, 10, 11, 2, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 10, 11, 5, 4, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 9, 11, 5, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 4: (2, 11, 5, 4, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 11, 5, 4, 0, 6, 12, 2)
- Cycle 6: (4, 5, 11, 10, 0, 6, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 5, 11, 10, 0, 9, 7, 19, 6, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 9, 11, 10, 0, 6, 12, 4)
- Cycle 9: (6, 0, 10, 11, 5, 4, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 0, 10, 11, 9, 7, 19, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 4, 5, 11, 9, 7, 19, 6)
- Cycle 12: (12, 0, 10, 11, 5, 4, 12)
- Cycle 13: (12, 2, 11, 5, 4, 0, 6, 12)
- Cycle 14: (16, 3, 4, 5, 11, 2, 16)
- Cycle 15: (16, 3, 4, 5, 11, 10, 0, 6, 12, 16)
- Cycle 16: (16, 3, 4, 9, 11, 10, 0, 6, 12, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 7: (4, 5, 11, 10, 0, 9, 7, 19, 6, 4). The chord is (5, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 16 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <4, 5, 11, 10> with the chord (5, 9)
