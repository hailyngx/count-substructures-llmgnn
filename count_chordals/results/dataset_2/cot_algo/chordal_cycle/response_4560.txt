Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, we need to list all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

1. Cycle 1: 0 -> 1 -> 13 -> 5 -> 3 -> 0
2. Cycle 2: 0 -> 1 -> 13 -> 6 -> 12 -> 0
3. Cycle 3: 0 -> 1 -> 13 -> 10 -> 14 -> 0
4. Cycle 4: 4 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 5 -> 4
5. Cycle 5: 4 -> 7 -> 6 -> 12 -> 3 -> 4
6. Cycle 6: 4 -> 7 -> 10 -> 3 -> 0 -> 4
7. Cycle 7: 4 -> 8 -> 9 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
8. Cycle 8: 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 12 -> 6 -> 4
9. Cycle 9: 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 11 -> 13 -> 4
10. Cycle 10: 4 -> 14 -> 10 -> 13 -> 5 -> 4
11. Cycle 11: 4 -> 14 -> 2 -> 12 -> 3 -> 4
12. Cycle 12: 4 -> 14 -> 10 -> 3 -> 0 -> 4
13. Cycle 13: 7 -> 6 -> 13 -> 5 -> 10 -> 7
14. Cycle 14: 7 -> 10 -> 14 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7
15. Cycle 15: 8 -> 9 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 -> 8
16. Cycle 16: 8 -> 9 -> 2 -> 12 -> 6 -> 8
17. Cycle 17: 8 -> 9 -> 14 -> 10 -> 13 -> 8
18. Cycle 18: 8 -> 2 -> 12 -> 3 -> 4 -> 8
19. Cycle 19: 8 -> 2 -> 12 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8
20. Cycle 20: 9 -> 14 -> 10 -> 13 -> 5 -> 9
21. Cycle 21: 9 -> 14 -> 4 -> 0 -> 1 -> 9
22. Cycle 22: 10 -> 5 -> 13 -> 11 -> 2 -> 10

Next, we need to identify the chordal 4-cycles by checking for cycles with exactly one chord. There are three such chordal 4-cycles:

1. <0, 2, 9, 14>
2. <3, 5, 13, 6>
3. <4, 7, 10, 14>

Finally, we count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [19].
