Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, (10, 2), 3, (0, 12)>
- <8, (2, 0), 12, (14, 5)>
- <7, (6, 10), 9, (13, 2)>
- <5, (8, 1), 4, (11, 0)>
- <4, (2, 8), 5, (14, 3)>
- <8, (1, 7), 9, (13, 2)>
- <14, (12, 0), 5, (4, 11)>
- <11, (4, 5), 13, (9, 3)>
- <5, (8, 1), 14, (3, 0)>
- <13, (9, 2), 11, (4, 5)>
- <12, (0, 2), 14, (5, 4)>
- <14, (3, 0), 1, (8, 5)>
- <3, (6, 7), 9, (13, 11)>
- <1, (8, 5), 7, (6, 10)>
- <3, (0, 2), 14, (5, 4)>
- <6, (7, 9), 10, (2, 0)>
- <2, (13, 9), 10, (7, 1)>
- <10, (6, 7), 2, (0, 8)>
- <3, (0, 12), 14, (5, 4)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 18 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [18].
