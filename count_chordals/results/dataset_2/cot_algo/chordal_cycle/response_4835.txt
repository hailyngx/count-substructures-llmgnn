Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 11) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 12, 2)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 8, 4)
- Cycle 3: (5, 13, 10, 1)
- Cycle 4: (0, 12, 2, 11)
- Cycle 5: (0, 3, 8, 4)
- Cycle 6: (0, 5, 13, 10)
- Cycle 7: (0, 10, 1, 5)
- Cycle 8: (0, 10, 14, 6)

Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 8), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (10, 13), 5>

Step 3:
Putting all unique chordal 4-cycles found inside brackets, we get [2].
