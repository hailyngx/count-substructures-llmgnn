Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 3) (12, 27) (12, 18) (12, 17) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 17) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 28) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 11) (2, 18) (2, 26) (13, 18) (13, 26) (26, 2) (26, 13) (26, 20) (26, 0) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 7) (10, 3) (10, 29) (16, 28) (28, 8) (28, 5) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 14) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 24) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (21, 19) (21, 17) (24, 1) (24, 3) (24, 29) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 25) (19, 21) (19, 11) (19, 17) (20, 26) (20, 23) (0, 18) (0, 26) (0, 23) (9, 28) (9, 7) (9, 14) (14, 28) (14, 9) (25, 15) (25, 5) (25, 11) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 21) (17, 19) (29, 15) (29, 10) (29, 24) (23, 27) (23, 20) (23, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (15, 27, 12, 18, 22) with edges (15, 27), (27, 12), (12, 18), (18, 22), (22, 15)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 5, 6, 22) with edges (4, 8), (8, 5), (5, 6), (6, 22), (22, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 28, 16, 5) with edges (4, 8), (8, 28), (28, 16), (16, 5), (5, 4)
- Cycle 4: (10, 3, 22, 18, 2) with edges (10, 3), (3, 22), (22, 18), (18, 2), (2, 10)
- Cycle 5: (10, 3, 7, 1, 15) with edges (10, 3), (3, 7), (7, 1), (1, 15), (15, 10)
- Cycle 6: (21, 19, 17, 12, 27) with edges (21, 19), (19, 17), (17, 12), (12, 27), (27, 21)
- Cycle 7: (20, 26, 13, 18, 22) with edges (20, 26), (26, 13), (13, 18), (18, 22), (22, 20)
- Cycle 8: (21, 17, 8, 4, 8) with edges (21, 17), (17, 8), (8, 4), (4, 21)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: No chords
- Cycle 2: Chord (5, 22)
- Cycle 3: Chord (8, 16)
- Cycle 4: No chords
- Cycle 5: No chords
- Cycle 6: No chords
- Cycle 7: No chords
- Cycle 8: No chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found with exactly one chord, so the final answer is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: < (5, 22), 4, 8, 16 >
