Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 22) (15, 26) (15, 17) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 20) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 9) (0, 24) (0, 4) (27, 21) (27, 19) (8, 5) (23, 26) (23, 4) (23, 7) (23, 13) (4, 0) (4, 23) (4, 29) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 25) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 9) (17, 7) (25, 18) (25, 13) (25, 14) (25, 24) (11, 14) (19, 5) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 1) (16, 14) (10, 21) (10, 29) (10, 26) (21, 27) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 12) (21, 22) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 6) (26, 15) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 29) (1, 9) (1, 19) (29, 4) (29, 10) (29, 26) (29, 6) (7, 3) (7, 23) (7, 17) (7, 6) (13, 23) (13, 25) (13, 21) (6, 12) (6, 29) (6, 7) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 24) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 14) (20, 5) (20, 22) (22, 3) (22, 21) (22, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: <3, 17, 15, 26, 23, 4, 0, 9>
2. Cycle 2: <3, 17, 7, 23, 4, 0, 9>
3. Cycle 3: <3, 17, 7, 23, 13, 25, 18, 2>
4. Cycle 4: <3, 17, 7, 6, 12, 21, 27, 19>
5. Cycle 5: <15, 26, 10, 21, 27, 19, 5, 2>
6. Cycle 6: <15, 26, 10, 29, 6, 7, 23, 4>
7. Cycle 7: <15, 26, 10, 29, 6, 12, 9, 0>

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, cycle 1 has a chord 15-23, cycle 2 has a chord 7-23, cycle 3 has a chord 17-25, cycle 4 has a chord 7-21, and cycle 5 has a chord 26-21.

Step 3:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final number inside brackets is [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <3, 17, 15, 26, (23, 4), 0, 9>
2. <3, 17, 7, (23, 4), 0, 9>
3. <3, 17, 7, 6, 12, (21, 27), 19>
4. <15, 26, 10, (21, 27), 19, 5, 2>
5. <15, 26, 10, 29, 6, (7, 23), 4>
