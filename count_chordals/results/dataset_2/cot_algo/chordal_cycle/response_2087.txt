Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 18) (4, 8) (4, 18) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (5, 15) (5, 10) (19, 0) (19, 9) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 16) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (16, 1) (16, 6) (14, 9) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 15) (7, 18) (7, 17) (7, 13) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 7) (11, 18) (11, 9) (11, 12) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

    - Cycle 1: (1, 3, 18, 11, 9, 8, 2, 13, 7, 17)
    - Cycle 2: (4, 18, 15, 5, 10, 0, 19, 9, 11)
    - Cycle 3: (6, 1, 3, 18, 7, 17, 2, 8)
    - Cycle 4: (14, 9, 11, 18, 7, 13, 2, 17)
    - Cycle 5: (12, 1, 6, 16, 1, 3, 18, 11)
    - Cycle 6: (15, 5, 10, 13, 7, 18, 11, 9)
    - Cycle 7: (4, 8, 9, 19, 0, 10, 5, 15)
    - Cycle 8: (6, 16, 1, 12, 0, 13, 7, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

    From the above cycles, only Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (9, 8) (which connects non-adjacent nodes 9 and 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

    The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:

    <1, (9, 8), 2, 13, 7>
