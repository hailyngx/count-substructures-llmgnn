Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: (5, 1, 4, 0, 5)
2. Cycle 2: (5, 0, 2, 9, 5)
3. Cycle 3: (5, 3, 6, 1, 5)
4. Cycle 4: (9, 7, 6, 1, 9)
5. Cycle 5: (4, 0, 5, 8, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

1. Cycle 1: <1, (0, 4), 5>
2. Cycle 2: <1, (9, 2), 5>
3. Cycle 3: No chord present
4. Cycle 4: <1, (7, 6), 9>
5. Cycle 5: No chord present

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there are 3 chordless cycles found, the final count is [3].
