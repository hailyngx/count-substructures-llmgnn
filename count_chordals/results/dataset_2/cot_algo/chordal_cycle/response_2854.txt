Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [27]. 
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<9, 15, 7, (23, 17), 3>
<9, 15, 17, (2, 23), 18, 26>
<9, 16, 20, 24, 7, 15, 17>
<26, 18, 21, 4, 14, 0, 6>
<1, 26, 18, 21, 4, 17, 2>
<15, 17, 2, 23, 7, 24, 20>
<18, 26, 8, 29, 19, 24, 7>
<0, 14, 22, 10, 5, 26, 1>
<14, 0, 6, 25, 27, 12, 29>
