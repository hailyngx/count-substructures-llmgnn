Step 2: Checking for chordal 4-cycles in the cycles listed above:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 2> has a chord (5, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 9, 1, 6> has a chord (5, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 9, 1, 8> has a chord (5, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found. 

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
