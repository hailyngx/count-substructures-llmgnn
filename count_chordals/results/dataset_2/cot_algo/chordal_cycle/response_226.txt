Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (5, 9, 6, 7) with chord (5, 7)
2. (5, 7, 2, 3) with chord (5, 3)
3. (9, 6, 3, 2) with chord (9, 2)
4. (9, 4, 6, 1) with chord (9, 1)
5. (4, 6, 7, 2) with chord (4, 2)
6. (4, 1, 6, 9) with chord (4, 9)
7. (7, 2, 8, 6) with chord (7, 6)
8. (2, 3, 6, 9) with chord (2, 9)
9. (2, 7, 5, 3) with chord (2, 5)
10. (8, 6, 4, 0) with chord (8, 4)
11. (1, 6, 3, 2) with chord (1, 2)
12. (1, 4, 9, 6) with chord (1, 9)
13. (0, 4, 6, 1) with chord (0, 1)
14. (3, 6, 1, 4) with chord (3, 4)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, (5, 7), 9)>
<7, (5, 3), 2)>
<9, (9, 2), 6)>
<11, (9, 1), 6)>
<12, (4, 9), 6)>
<14, (0, 1), 4)>

Step 3:
There are [6] chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
