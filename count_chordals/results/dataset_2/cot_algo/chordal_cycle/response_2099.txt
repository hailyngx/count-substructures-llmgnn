Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 27) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 17) (16, 28) (16, 12) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (0, 21) (0, 19) (27, 11) (27, 19) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 13) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 24) (1, 20) (26, 25) (26, 4) (2, 11) (2, 4) (28, 16) (28, 29) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 14) (22, 9) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 14) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 20) (17, 18) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 18) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 7) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 5) (7, 20) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 25) (7, 14) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 18) (18, 23) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 25) (12, 11) (12, 16) (13, 15) (13, 23) (13, 24) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 21) (24, 8) (24, 20) (24, 13) (24, 14) (14, 29) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 24) (4, 15) (4, 26) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (11, 27, 19, 0, 21, 10, 8, 23, 13, 15, 3, 17, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 27, 19, 18, 23, 8, 10, 21, 0, 19, 27, 11)
- Cycle 3: (3, 15, 13, 23, 8, 10, 7, 20, 17, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 17, 18, 19, 0, 21, 5, 15, 13, 23, 8, 10, 7, 20, 17)
- Cycle 5: (7, 20, 17, 18, 19, 0, 21, 5, 29, 28, 16, 12, 11, 27, 19, 18, 25, 7)
- Cycle 6: (20, 17, 18, 19, 27, 11, 2, 4, 26, 25, 7, 20)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (11, 17).
- Cycle 2 has one chord (11, 27).
- Cycle 3 has one chord (3, 23).
- Cycle 4 has one chord (3, 15).
- Cycle 5 has one chord (7, 14).
- Cycle 6 has one chord (20, 24).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (11, 17)>
<2, (11, 27)>
<3, (3, 23)>
<4, (3, 15)>
<5, (7, 14)>
<6, (20, 24)>
