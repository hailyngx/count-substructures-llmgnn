Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 2) (16, 8) (16, 9) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 10) (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 17) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 17) (10, 11) (10, 9) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 8) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 14) (2, 11) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 2) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 1) (19, 0) (0, 19) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-18-2-11-10-9-15-3-12-5-17-14-8-16-9-10-11-2-18-1
- Cycle 2: 1-18-2-11-10-9-5-17-14-8-16-9-10-11-2-18-1
- Cycle 3: 1-18-2-11-10-9-5-12-3-15-7-4-17-14-8-16-9-10-11-2-18-1
- Cycle 4: 19-1-18-2-11-10-9-5-12-3-15-7-4-17-14-8-16-9-10-11-2-18-1
- Cycle 5: 19-1-18-2-11-10-9-16-8-14-17-5-12-3-15-7-4-17-14-8-16-9-10-11-2-18-1
- Cycle 6: 19-1-18-2-11-10-9-16-8-14-17-5-12-3-4-17-14-8-16-9-10-11-2-18-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, 18, 2, 11> with chord (10, 9)
- <11, 2, 18, 1> with chord (10, 9)
- <1, 18, 2, 11> with chord (9, 10)
- <1, 18, 2, 11> with chord (16, 8)
- <1, 18, 2, 11> with chord (16, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. 
So, the final count is [6].
