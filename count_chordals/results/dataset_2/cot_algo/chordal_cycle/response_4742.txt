Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (1, 25) (1, 22) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 12) (25, 1) (25, 3) (25, 14) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 22) (20, 4) (20, 6) (22, 1) (22, 15) (22, 17) (26, 16) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 7) (19, 4) (19, 10) (16, 26) (16, 28) (16, 21) (28, 16) (28, 0) (28, 23) (27, 8) (27, 17) (21, 16) (21, 0) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 24) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 2) (29, 24) (29, 18) (29, 10) (18, 15) (18, 29) (18, 23) (18, 8) (23, 28) (23, 18) (23, 4) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 24) (4, 20) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 10) (6, 20) (6, 8) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 29) (10, 2) (10, 4) (24, 7) (24, 29) (24, 2) (24, 17) (17, 22) (17, 27) (17, 24) (12, 3) (12, 14) (8, 27) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 6) (14, 25) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <5, 9, 2, 11>
        - <1, 25, 3, 12>
        - <1, 25, 14, 12>
        - <5, 13, 7, 11>
        - <5, 13, 9, 7>
        - <7, 11, 2, 9>
        - <7, 11, 13, 9>
        - <7, 13, 5, 9>
        - <7, 13, 11, 9>
        - <9, 11, 2, 7>
        - <9, 11, 13, 7>
        - <9, 13, 5, 7>
        - <9, 13, 11, 7>
        - <21, 16, 26, 28>
        - <21, 16, 28, 0>
        - <21, 0, 28, 23>
        - <15, 7, 13, 11>
        - <15, 7, 9, 13>
        - <15, 11, 13, 7>
        - <15, 11, 9, 13>
        - <15, 22, 1, 25>
        - <15, 22, 1, 3>
        - <15, 22, 17, 24>
        - <15, 18, 29, 10>
        - <15, 18, 23, 4>
        - <18, 15, 22, 17>
        - <18, 15, 22, 1>
        - <18, 15, 7, 11>
        - <18, 15, 11, 7>
        - <18, 23, 4, 10>
        - <18, 23, 28, 0>
   
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
        - <5, 9, 2, 11>, chord: (5, 11)
        - <1, 25, 3, 12>, chord: (1, 3)
        - <7, 13, 5, 9>, chord: (7, 5)
        - <9, 11, 2, 7>, chord: (9, 7)
        - <21, 16, 26, 28>, chord: (16, 28)

Finally, [5] chordal 4-cycles were found in the graph.
