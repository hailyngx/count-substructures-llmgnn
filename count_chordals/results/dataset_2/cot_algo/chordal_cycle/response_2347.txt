Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-9-3-4
- Cycle 2: 4-7-2-6-4
- Cycle 3: 4-8-2-6-4
- Cycle 4: 5-7-9-3-5
- Cycle 5: 5-8-2-6-5
- Cycle 6: 5-8-0-1-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, (7, 9), 3>
- <4, (7, 2), 6>
- <4, (8, 2), 6>
- <5, (7, 9), 3>
- <5, (8, 2), 6>
- <5, (8, 0), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [6].
