Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-8-9-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-9-8-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (4, 8), forming a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 4, 8, 9>
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (1, 8), forming a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 1, 9, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
