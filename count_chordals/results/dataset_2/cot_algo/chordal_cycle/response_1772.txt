This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 18) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 18) (8, 16) (13, 15) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 19) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 15) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 11) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 19) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 5) (16, 8) (16, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
    - Cycle <1, 3, 12, 0>
    - Cycle <1, 3, 18, 5>
    - Cycle <1, 7, 4, 2>
    - Cycle <1, 7, 17, 6>
    - Cycle <1, 10, 15, 13>
    - Cycle <1, 10, 14, 19>
    - Cycle <2, 0, 12, 3>
    - Cycle <2, 4, 7, 17>
    - Cycle <2, 6, 17, 4>
    - Cycle <3, 1, 7, 4>
    - Cycle <3, 12, 0, 9>
    - Cycle <3, 18, 5, 16>
    - Cycle <4, 7, 17, 11>
    - Cycle <5, 6, 2, 4>
    - Cycle <5, 16, 8, 16>
    - Cycle <6, 2, 4, 17>
    - Cycle <7, 4, 11, 17>
    - Cycle <9, 0, 12, 15>
    - Cycle <9, 11, 17, 6>
    - Cycle <9, 11, 19, 14>
    - Cycle <10, 1, 7, 17>
    - Cycle <10, 15, 13, 15>
    - Cycle <10, 14, 19, 11>
    - Cycle <11, 17, 6, 2>
    - Cycle <12, 0, 2, 4>
    - Cycle <12, 3, 1, 7>
    - Cycle <13, 15, 10, 1>
    - Cycle <14, 19, 11, 17>
    - Cycle <15, 10, 1, 7>
    - Cycle <16, 8, 16, 5>
    - Cycle <17, 4, 7, 1>
    - Cycle <18, 7, 1, 3>
    
Step 2:
- The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
    - Chordal 4-cycle <1, (3, 12), 0>
    - Chordal 4-cycle <1, (7, 17), 6>
    - Chordal 4-cycle <1, (10, 14), 19>
    - Chordal 4-cycle <2, (4, 17), 7>
    - Chordal 4-cycle <3, (1, 7), 4>
    - Chordal 4-cycle <5, (6, 2), 4>
    - Chordal 4-cycle <11, (17, 6), 2>
    - Chordal 4-cycle <12, (0, 2), 4>
    - Chordal 4-cycle <13, (15, 10), 1>
    - Chordal 4-cycle <14, (19, 11), 17>
    - Chordal 4-cycle <16, (8, 16), 5>
    - Chordal 4-cycle <18, (7, 1), 3>
    
Step 3:
- The total number of chordal 4-cycles is [12].
