Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-8-9-1
- Cycle 3: 3-4-6-3
- Cycle 4: 3-5-7-3
- Cycle 5: 4-8-9-4
- Cycle 6: 2-9-0-2
- Cycle 7: 6-7-9-6

Step 2:
Among these cycles, only Cycle 1 <1, 3, 5, 1> has exactly one chord (1, 3).

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
