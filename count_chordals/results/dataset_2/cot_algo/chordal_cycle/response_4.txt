Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 0-8-6-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-5-7-0
- Cycle 3: 1-8-6-2-1
- Cycle 4: 2-9-4-3-2
- Cycle 5: 2-7-5-8-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1: 0-6-3-0 has chord (6, 3)
- Cycle 2: 0-3-5-7-0 has chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 3: 1-8-6-2-1 has chord (8, 2)
- Cycle 4: 2-9-4-3-2 has chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 5: 2-7-5-8-2 has chord (7, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, (6, 3), 3, 6>
- <0, 5, 7, (3, 5), 0>
- <1, (8, 2), 6, 2, 1>
- <2, 9, (9, 4), 3, 2>
- <2, (7, 8), 5, 8, 2>
