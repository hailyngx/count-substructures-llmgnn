Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 13) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 9) (1, 0) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 11) (13, 18) (13, 12) (19, 3) (19, 14) (19, 5) (10, 15) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 7) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 16) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 12) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 16) (7, 11) (7, 9) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 10, 16, 0, 1, 2, 6)
- Cycle 2: (15, 10, 16, 0, 1, 2, 6, 2)
- Cycle 3: (14, 19, 5, 11, 7, 9, 4, 12)
- Cycle 4: (17, 11, 5, 19, 14, 19, 3, 15)
- Cycle 5: (2, 1, 0, 3, 19, 14, 17, 11)
- Cycle 6: (18, 1, 0, 3, 19, 14, 17, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 12, 3, 15, 10, 16, 8, 9)
- Cycle 8: (1, 9, 4, 12, 3, 15, 10, 16)
- Cycle 9: (5, 19, 14, 17, 11, 7, 9, 1)
- Cycle 10: (13, 18, 2, 1, 0, 3, 15, 10)
- Cycle 11: (19, 3, 15, 10, 16, 8, 9, 7)
- Cycle 12: (10, 16, 8, 9, 4, 12, 3, 15)
- Cycle 13: (11, 7, 9, 4, 12, 3, 15, 10)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (2, 6), 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 0, (2, 6), 2>
- Cycle 3: <5, (11, 7), 9, 4>
- Cycle 4: <17, (19, 14), 15, 3>
- Cycle 5: <1, (0, 3), 15, 10>
- Cycle 6: <1, (0, 3), 17, 4>
- Cycle 7: <9, (8, 16), 10, 3>
- Cycle 8: <9, (4, 12), 15, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, (14, 17), 9, 19>
- Cycle 10: <1, (0, 3), 10, 15>
- Cycle 11: <15, (8, 16), 10, 9>
- Cycle 12: <9, (4, 12), 15, 16>
- Cycle 13: <9, (4, 12), 15, 10>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are [0] chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
