Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 7) (10, 7) (10, 4) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 17) (6, 5) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 18) (12, 0) (9, 18) (9, 14) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (13, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-15-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-18-19-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-16-6-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-16-11-1
- Cycle 5: 1-5-6-17-1
- Cycle 6: 1-5-6-16-1
- Cycle 7: 1-5-8-17-1
- Cycle 8: 1-5-8-0-1
- Cycle 9: 1-7-10-4-1
- Cycle 10: 1-7-5-6-1
- Cycle 11: 1-7-5-8-1
- Cycle 12: 1-7-8-17-1
- Cycle 13: 1-14-9-18-1
- Cycle 14: 1-14-5-6-1
- Cycle 15: 1-14-5-8-1
- Cycle 16: 1-14-9-18-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 15, 4> with chord (3, 4)
- <1, 3, 18, 19> with chord (3, 18)
- <1, 3, 16, 6> with chord (3, 16)
- <1, 3, 16, 11> with chord (3, 16)
- <1, 5, 6, 17> with chord (5, 6)
- <1, 5, 6, 16> with chord (5, 6)
- <1, 5, 8, 17> with chord (5, 8)
- <1, 5, 8, 0> with chord (5, 8)
- <1, 7, 10, 4> with chord (7, 4)
- <1, 7, 5, 6> with chord (7, 5)
- <1, 7, 5, 8> with chord (7, 5)
- <1, 7, 8, 17> with chord (7, 8)
- <1, 14, 9, 18> with chord (14, 9)
- <1, 14, 5, 6> with chord (14, 5)
- <1, 14, 5, 8> with chord (14, 5)
- <1, 14, 9, 18> with chord (14, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found. There are 16 chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [16].
