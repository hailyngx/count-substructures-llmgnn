Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 9) (16, 6) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 13) (7, 12) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 9) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 13) (19, 18) (19, 13) (15, 12) (15, 14) (14, 2) (14, 15) (6, 16) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 1) (0, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (9, 16) (9, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-3-6-12-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-4-10-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-0-1
- Cycle 4: 1-8-11-18-1
- Cycle 5: 2-14-15-12-2
- Cycle 6: 2-18-19-13-2
- Cycle 7: 3-6-12-17-3
- Cycle 8: 4-5-0-1-4
- Cycle 9: 4-10-2-14-4
- Cycle 10: 6-10-2-18-6
- Cycle 11: 9-16-6-3-9
- Cycle 12: 9-13-18-11-9
- Cycle 13: 12-2-14-15-12
- Cycle 14: 12-6-3-4-12
- Cycle 15: 13-18-19-13
- Cycle 16: 17-12-15-14-17

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<1, 3, (6, 12), 1>
<1, 5, (4, 10), 2, 1>
<2, 14, (15, 12), 2>
<2, 18, (19, 13), 2>
<3, 6, (12, 17), 3>
<4, 5, (0, 1), 4>
<9, 16, (6, 3), 9>
<9, 13, (18, 11), 9>
<12, 2, (14, 15), 12>
<17, 12, (15, 14), 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
So, there are a total of [6] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
