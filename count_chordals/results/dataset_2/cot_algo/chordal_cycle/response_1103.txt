Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 19) (11, 17) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 16) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 3) (1, 7) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 0) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 13) (12, 8) (12, 16) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 12) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 1) (7, 17) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (9, 6, 3, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 17, 11, 19, 9)
- Cycle 3: (10, 9, 6, 3, 10)
- Cycle 4: (10, 15, 8, 5, 10)
- Cycle 5: (2, 10, 15, 0, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 19, 11, 17, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 14, 13, 4, 2)
- Cycle 8: (18, 16, 5, 10, 18)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 15, 0, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 13, 14, 2, 4)
- Cycle 11: (5, 8, 15, 0, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 10, 15, 0, 5)
- Cycle 13: (5, 19, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 14: (5, 16, 18, 13, 5)
- Cycle 15: (19, 11, 17, 7, 19)
- Cycle 16: (19, 1, 7, 17, 19)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (9, 6), 3, 9>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <2, (17, 11), 19, 9>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <3, (6, 3), 10, 9>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <4, (15, 8), 5, 10>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <5, (15, 0), 2, 10>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <6, (11, 17), 2, 19>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <7, (13, 4), 2, 14>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <8, (10, 5), 18, 16>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <9, (15, 0), 4, 8>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <10, (14, 2), 4, 13>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <11, (15, 0), 5, 8>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <12, (15, 0), 5, 10>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <13, (1, 7), 5, 19>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <14, (18, 13), 5, 16>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <15, (19, 7), 11, 17>: Valid chordal 4-cycle
- <16, (1, 7), 17, 19>: Valid chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 16 valid chordal 4-cycles found. 
Therefore, the final count is [16].
