Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 6, 4)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 6, 3)
- Cycle 3: (5, 1, 3, 6)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 6, 1)
- Cycle 5: (9, 1, 6, 4)
- Cycle 6: (9, 1, 6, 3)
- Cycle 7: (9, 1, 3, 6)
- Cycle 8: (9, 3, 6, 1)

Step 2: 
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 6, 4) - Chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 6, 3) - Chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 3: (5, 1, 3, 6) - Chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 6, 1) - Chord: (3, 6)
- Cycle 5: (9, 1, 6, 4) - Chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 6: (9, 1, 6, 3) - Chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 7: (9, 1, 3, 6) - Chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 8: (9, 3, 6, 1) - Chord: (3, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, (1, 6), 4>
- <5, (1, 6), 3>
- <5, (1, 6), 3>
- <5, (3, 6), 1>
- <9, (1, 6), 4>
- <9, (1, 6), 3>
- <9, (1, 6), 3>
- <9, (3, 6), 1>
