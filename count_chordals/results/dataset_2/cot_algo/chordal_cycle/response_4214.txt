Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-5-1-4
- Cycle 2: 4-6-1-2-4
- Cycle 3: 4-9-7-3-4
- Cycle 4: 4-0-3-2-4
- Cycle 5: 7-5-1-6-7
- Cycle 6: 7-9-6-5-7
- Cycle 7: 7-3-0-2-7
- Cycle 8: 1-5-3-6-1
- Cycle 9: 1-8-2-0-1
- Cycle 10: 3-0-2-8-3
- Cycle 11: 6-5-7-9-6

Step 2:  
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: <1, 5>  
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: <6, 1> 
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: <7, 3>  
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: <2, 4>  
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: <1, 6>
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: <5, 7>
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: <0, 2>
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: <3, 6>
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: <0, 1>
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: <0, 2>
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: <5, 6>

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless cycles:  
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
