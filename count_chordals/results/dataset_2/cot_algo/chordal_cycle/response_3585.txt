Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 19) (14, 18) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 18) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 4) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 7) (17, 3) (17, 13) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 11) (19, 0) (19, 2) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 2) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (12, 9) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 0) (8, 11) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4:  
- (5, 9, 7, 13)
- (5, 15, 18, 11)
- (5, 16, 1, 10)
- (9, 12, 14, 18)
- (6, 2, 11, 1)
- (1, 3, 13, 17)
- (3, 0, 19, 2)
- (0, 8, 11, 2)
- (14, 18, 15, 4)

Step 2: Checking for chords: 
- (5, 9, 7, 13) has a chord (9, 7)
- (5, 15, 18, 11) has a chord (15, 11)
- (5, 16, 1, 10) has a chord (16, 1)
- (9, 12, 14, 18) has a chord (9, 14)
- (6, 2, 11, 1) has a chord (6, 11)
- (1, 3, 13, 17) has a chord (1, 13)
- (3, 0, 19, 2) has a chord (3, 19)
- (0, 8, 11, 2) has a chord (0, 11)
- (14, 18, 15, 4) has a chord (18, 15)

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycle:  
There are a total of [9] unique chordal 4-cycles:  
- <5, (9, 7), 13>
- <5, (15, 11), 18>
- <5, (16, 1), 10>
- <9, (9, 14), 12>
- <6, (6, 11), 2>
- <1, (1, 13), 3>
- <3, (3, 19), 0>
- <0, (0, 11), 8>
- <18, (18, 15), 14>
