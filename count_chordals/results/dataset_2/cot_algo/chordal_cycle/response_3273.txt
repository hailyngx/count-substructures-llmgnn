Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 13) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 14, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 2, 7, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 0, 4, 6, 8, 7, 12, 10, 0)
- Cycle 4: (7, 11, 14, 13, 10, 1, 8, 6, 3, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (9, 14)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (3, 7)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (0, 6)
- Cycle 4 is chordless

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
There is 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1], and the unique chordal 4-cycle is <7, 11, 14, 13, 10, 1, 8, 6, 3, 7>.
