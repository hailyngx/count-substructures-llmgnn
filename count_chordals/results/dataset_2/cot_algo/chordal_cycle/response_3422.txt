Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
Let's first write down the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: {5, 9, 4}
Node 1: {5, 4, 6}
Node 2: {5, 9, 6, 3}
Node 3: {9, 7, 2, 8}
Node 4: {0, 1, 6}
Node 5: {9, 8, 1, 0, 2}
Node 6: {4, 7, 8, 1, 2}
Node 7: {9, 3, 6}
Node 8: {5, 9, 6, 3}
Node 9: {5, 8, 2, 3, 7, 0}

Now, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle: 0-4-6-2-0
2. Cycle: 0-4-1-5-0
3. Cycle: 0-5-8-6-0
4. Cycle: 0-5-9-3-0
5. Cycle: 0-9-7-3-0
6. Cycle: 0-9-5-8-0
7. Cycle: 1-4-6-2-1
8. Cycle: 1-5-0-9-1
9. Cycle: 1-5-8-6-1
10. Cycle: 1-6-4-0-1
11. Cycle: 1-6-8-5-1
12. Cycle: 2-5-8-6-2
13. Cycle: 2-5-9-3-2
14. Cycle: 2-6-7-3-2
15. Cycle: 2-6-8-5-2
16. Cycle: 3-7-6-4-3
17. Cycle: 3-7-9-5-3
18. Cycle: 3-8-5-0-3
19. Cycle: 3-8-6-4-3
20. Cycle: 4-1-6-8-4
21. Cycle: 5-0-9-7-5
22. Cycle: 5-1-6-4-5
23. Cycle: 5-2-6-8-5
24. Cycle: 6-1-4-0-6
25. Cycle: 6-2-5-8-6
26. Cycle: 6-4-1-5-6
27. Cycle: 6-7-3-9-6
28. Cycle: 6-8-5-1-6
29. Cycle: 6-8-7-9-6
30. Cycle: 7-3-9-5-7
31. Cycle: 8-5-1-4-8
32. Cycle: 8-6-4-0-8
33. Cycle: 8-6-7-3-8
34. Cycle: 8-9-5-0-8
35. Cycle: 9-0-5-1-9
36. Cycle: 9-3-7-6-9
37. Cycle: 9-5-1-4-9
38. Cycle: 9-7-3-2-9

Next, let's identify the unique chordal 4-cycles:

1. <0, (4,6), 2>
2. <0, (5,8), 9>
3. <1, (4,6), 5>
4. <2, (5,8), 6>
5. <3, (7,6), 9>

Finally, let's count the number of chordless cycles found and put this final number inside brackets:
