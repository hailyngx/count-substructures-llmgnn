Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

In this graph, some cycles of length 4 are:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 4 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 2 - 8 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 0 - 1 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 4: 9 - 4 - 3 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 5: 4 - 6 - 0 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 6: 8 - 2 - 5 - 9 - 8
- Cycle 7: 2 - 4 - 6 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 8: 0 - 1 - 7 - 8 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

From the cycles listed above, only the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 4 - 2 - 5 with chord (9, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since there is only one cycle with a chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (9, 2), 5>.
