Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 11) (27, 9) (27, 6) (6, 15) (6, 27) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 0) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 26) (13, 11) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 14) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 28) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 16) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 23) (14, 0) (14, 21) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 22) (26, 8) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 17) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 28) (4, 18) (4, 28) (4, 21) (4, 3) (18, 7) (18, 20) (18, 4) (18, 25) (22, 1) (22, 26) (22, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 20) (16, 12) (16, 5) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 3) (25, 9) (25, 18) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 29) (29, 7) (29, 25) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 17) (11, 27) (11, 13) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 16) (19, 6) (19, 25) (19, 28) (28, 7) (28, 20) (28, 4) (28, 19) (21, 14) (21, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of all cycles in the graph with 4 or more edges:
- Cycle 1: (11, 27, 6, 9, 11)
- Cycle 2: (0, 9, 27, 6, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 9, 27, 11, 13, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 10, 3, 4, 18, 20, 2, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 10, 8, 26, 23, 14, 0)
- Cycle 6: (1, 5, 22, 26, 8, 23, 14, 1)
- Cycle 7: (9, 27, 11, 13, 11)
- Cycle 8: (25, 17, 26, 8, 23, 14, 0, 9, 25)
- Cycle 9: (25, 17, 26, 22, 5, 16, 12, 7, 18, 25)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles: 
- Cycle 1 has chord (27, 9)
- Cycle 2 has chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 3 has chord (9, 27)
- Cycle 4 has chord (10, 3)
- Cycle 5 has no chords
- Cycle 6 has no chords
- Cycle 7 has chord (27, 11)
- Cycle 8 has chord (17, 26)
- Cycle 9 has no chords

Step 3:
Counting chordless cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<1, (27, 9)>
<3, (9, 27)>
<5, (0, 10)>
