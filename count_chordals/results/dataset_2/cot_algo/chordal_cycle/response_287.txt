Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 11, 7)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 13, 10)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 13, 2)
- Cycle 4: (5, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 5: (9, 7, 4, 6)
- Cycle 6: (9, 7, 1, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 13, 2, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 7, 9, 5)
- Cycle 9: (10, 11, 7, 9)
- Cycle 10: (10, 13, 8, 5)
- Cycle 11: (11, 14, 0, 10)
- Cycle 12: (11, 14, 6, 4)
- Cycle 13: (8, 13, 2, 0)
- Cycle 14: (13, 2, 0, 14)
- Cycle 15: (2, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 16: (2, 8, 13, 9)
- Cycle 17: (0, 10, 11, 14)
- Cycle 18: (0, 14, 6, 4)
- Cycle 19: (6, 4, 7, 9)
- Cycle 20: (6, 4, 7, 1)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (5, 8), 4, 6)>
- <2, (9, 13), 10, 11>
- <3, (5, 8), 7, 4>
- <4, (10, 13), 5, 9>
- <5, (7, 1), 9, 5>
- <6, (2, 3), 10, 11>
- <7, (7, 9), 13, 10>
- <8, (4, 7), 5, 9>
- <9, (10, 11), 7, 9>
- <10, (5, 8), 13, 2>
- <11, (6, 4), 10, 11>
- <12, (2, 0), 8, 13>
- <13, (0, 14), 10, 11>
- <14, (2, 0), 14, 11>
- <15, (5, 1), 8, 13>
- <16, (9, 13), 2, 3>
- <17, (0, 14), 10, 11>
- <18, (4, 6), 7, 1>

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [18]
