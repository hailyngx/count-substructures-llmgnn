Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 12, 6)
- Cycle 2: (4, 5, 0, 9)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 10, 13)
- Cycle 4: (8, 13, 6, 12)
- Cycle 5: (4, 8, 0, 2)
- Cycle 6: (11, 14, 7, 5)
- Cycle 7: (1, 10, 13, 4)
- Cycle 8: (3, 10, 13, 6)
- Cycle 9: (3, 11, 12, 6)
- Cycle 10: (8, 12, 6, 2)
- Cycle 11: (14, 7, 5, 0)
- Cycle 12: (5, 7, 14, 11)
- Cycle 13: (0, 5, 4, 6)
- Cycle 14: (0, 4, 6, 2)
- Cycle 15: (9, 0, 2, 3)
- Cycle 16: (9, 12, 6, 4)
- Cycle 17: (3, 2, 0, 9)
- Cycle 18: (6, 2, 0, 5)
- Cycle 19: (12, 6, 2, 3)
- Cycle 20: (7, 14, 11, 1)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Chordless cycle <5, 9, 12, 6>
- Chordless cycle <4, 5, 0, 9>
- Chordless cycle <1, 3, 10, 13>
- Chordless cycle <8, 13, 6, 12>
- Chordless cycle <4, 8, 0, 2>
- Chordless cycle <11, 14, 7, 5>
- Chordless cycle <1, 10, 13, 4>
- Chordless cycle <3, 10, 13, 6>
- Chordless cycle <3, 11, 12, 6>
- Chordless cycle <8, 12, 6, 2>
- Chordless cycle <14, 7, 5, 0>
- Chordless cycle <5, 7, 14, 11>
- Chordless cycle <0, 5, 4, 6>
- Chordless cycle <0, 4, 6, 2>
- Chordless cycle <9, 0, 2, 3>
- Chordless cycle <9, 12, 6, 4>
- Chordless cycle <3, 2, 0, 9>
- Chordless cycle <6, 2, 0, 5>
- Chordless cycle <12, 6, 2, 3>
- Chordless cycle <7, 14, 11, 1>

Step 3:
Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [20]
