- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 7, 5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 7, 8, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 1, 4, 10, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 1, 7, 5, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 1, 9, 12, 3)
- Cycle 8: (5, 7, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 7, 8, 1, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 7, 8, 1, 4, 10, 5)
- Cycle 11: (10, 4, 1, 7, 10)
- Cycle 12: (10, 4, 7, 5, 10)
- Cycle 13: (10, 4, 7, 8, 10)
- Cycle 14: (10, 13, 5, 7, 10)

- Cycle 16: (10, 13, 3, 1, 10)
- Cycle 17: (11, 10, 4, 1, 11)
- Cycle 18: (11, 10, 4, 7, 11)
- Cycle 19: (11, 10, 4, 7, 5, 13, 11)
- Cycle 20: (11, 10, 4, 7, 8, 1, 11)
- Cycle 21: (12, 9, 1, 7, 12)
- Cycle 22: (12, 9, 1, 4, 10, 12)
- Cycle 23: (13, 5, 7, 1, 13)
- Cycle 24: (13, 5, 7, 8, 1, 13)
- Cycle 25: (13, 5, 7, 8, 10, 4, 13)

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- <1, (4, 10), 9>
- <2, (10, 4), 13>
- <3, (4, 7), 5>
- <4, (1, 7), 8>
- <5, (4, 10), 3>
- <6, (4, 7), 5>
- <7, (1, 9), 12>
- <8, (5, 7), 1>
- <9, (5, 7), 8>
- <10, (4, 10), (5, 7)>
- <11, (4, 1), 7>
- <12, (10, 4), 7>
- <13, (10, 4), 7>
- <14, (10, 13), 5>
- <15, (10, 13), 5>
- <16, (10, 13), 3>
- <17, (11, 4), 10>
- <18, (11, 4), 7>
- <19, (11, 4), (5, 13)>
- <20, (11, 4), (8, 1)>
- <21, (12, 9), 1>
- <22, (10, 4), 9>
- <23, (5, 7), 1>
- <24, (5, 7), 8>
- <25, (5, 7), (10, 4)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 25 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the final count is [25].
