Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-7-14-10-2-11-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-11-2-10-14-4-12-1
- Cycle 3: 4-2-10-5-11-6-12-4

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (3, 14)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (6, 11)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (2, 5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (3, 14), 10, 2>
<1, (6, 11), 2, 10>
<4, (2, 5), 10, 11>
