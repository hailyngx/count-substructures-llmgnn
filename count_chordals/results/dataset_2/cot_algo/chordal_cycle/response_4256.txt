Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 7) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 2 - 4 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 5 - 3 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 3: 3 - 5 - 11 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 4: 3 - 11 - 7 - 10 - 3
- Cycle 5: 3 - 13 - 12 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 6: 11 - 5 - 12 - 8 - 11
- Cycle 7: 11 - 7 - 14 - 6 - 11
- Cycle 8: 14 - 4 - 8 - 12 - 14
- Cycle 9: 14 - 7 - 2 - 9 - 14
- Cycle 10: 12 - 5 - 6 - 14 - 12
- Cycle 11: 12 - 0 - 13 - 3 - 12
- Cycle 12: 0 - 9 - 10 - 1 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
1. <6, (14, 2), 9>
2. <6, (5, 3), 9>
3. <3, (5, 7), 11>
4. <3, (11, 7), 10>
5. <3, (13, 8), 12>
6. <11, (5, 12), 8>
7. <11, (7, 14), 6>
8. <14, (7, 9), 2>
9. <12, (5, 14), 6>
10. <12, (0, 13), 3>
11. <0, (9, 10), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles is [11].
