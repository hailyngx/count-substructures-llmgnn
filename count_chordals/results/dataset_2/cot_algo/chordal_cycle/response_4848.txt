Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-6-14-5-2-3-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-12-4-14-6-0
        - Cycle 3: 0-12-4-11-3-0
        - Cycle 4: 0-13-4-14-6-0
        - Cycle 5: 0-13-1-8-6-0
        - Cycle 6: 2-1-8-4-13-2
        - Cycle 7: 3-2-1-8-6-3
        - Cycle 8: 4-8-1-13-0-4
        - Cycle 9: 6-8-1-13-0-6
        - Cycle 10: 6-8-4-13-0-6
        - Cycle 11: 7-6-8-1-13-7
        - Cycle 12: 9-10-12-4-8-9
        - Cycle 13: 9-11-3-0-13-9
        - Cycle 14: 10-12-0-13-1-10
        - Cycle 15: 11-3-8-1-2-11
        - Cycle 16: 13-1-8-4-14-13

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord 14-6
        - Cycle 2 has a chord 14-4
        - Cycle 3 has a chord 12-4
        - Cycle 4 has a chord 14-6
        - Cycle 5 has a chord 1-8
        - Cycle 6 has a chord 1-13
        - Cycle 7 has a chord 1-8
        - Cycle 8 has a chord 4-13
        - Cycle 9 has a chord 1-13
        - Cycle 10 has a chord 4-13
        - Cycle 11 has a chord 1-13
        - Cycle 12 has a chord 12-4
        - Cycle 13 has a chord 3-0
        - Cycle 14 has a chord 13-1
        - Cycle 15 has a chord 1-8
        - Cycle 16 has a chord 4-14

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
        <0, 6, 8, 4, 12>
