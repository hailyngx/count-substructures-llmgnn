Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, (7, 2), 8> with chord (7, 2)
- <4, (7, 5), 2> with chord (7, 5)
- <4, (13, 2), 5> with chord (13, 2)
- <4, (1, 8), 9> with chord (1, 8)
- <4, (6, 13), 5> with chord (6, 13)
- <7, (2, 8), 9> with chord (2, 8)
- <7, (5, 13), 4> with chord (5, 13)
- <7, (0, 2), 13> with chord (0, 2)
- <2, (8, 9), 10> with chord (8, 9)
- <2, (13, 6), 4> with chord (13, 6)
- <8, (9, 10), 13> with chord (9, 10)
- <5, (7, 0), 2> with chord (7, 0)
- <5, (13, 10), 9> with chord (13, 10)
- <13, (4, 7), 0> with chord (4, 7)
- <9, (8, 2), 7> with chord (8, 2)
- <9, (10, 13), 6> with chord (10, 13)
- <10, (8, 2), 0> with chord (8, 2)
- <5, (2, 8), 1> with chord (2, 8)
- <6, (4, 1), 8> with chord (4, 1)
- <6, (13, 2), 0> with chord (13, 2)
- <6, (0, 7), 5> with chord (0, 7)
- <6, (11, 12), 3> with chord (11, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. Since all cycles have at least one chord, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
