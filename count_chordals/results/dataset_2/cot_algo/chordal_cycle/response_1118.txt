Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- (0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 0) Cycle of length 5
- (0, 1, 4, 9, 0) Cycle of length 4
- (0, 1, 8, 4, 9, 0) Cycle of length 5
- (1, 0, 9, 4, 8, 1) Cycle of length 5
- (2, 3, 0, 9, 4, 2) Cycle of length 5
- (3, 0, 9, 8, 1, 3) Cycle of length 5
- (4, 9, 8, 1, 0, 4) Cycle of length 5
- (5, 6, 2, 9, 0, 5) Cycle of length 5
- (6, 5, 0, 9, 2, 6) Cycle of length 5
- (7, 8, 1, 0, 3, 7) Cycle of length 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- (0, 1, 4, 9, 0): Chord (1, 9)
- (1, 0, 9, 4, 8, 1): Chord (0, 8)
- (2, 3, 0, 9, 4, 2): Chord (3, 4)
- (3, 0, 9, 8, 1, 3): Chord (0, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- There are 1 chordless 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count is [1], and the unique chordal 4-cycle is <0, 1, 4, 9> (chords: (1, 9)).
