Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 27) (16, 6) (20, 24) (25, 1) (25, 18) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 14) (27, 16) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 19) (8, 16) (8, 24) (8, 0) (23, 1) (23, 3) (15, 26) (15, 5) (15, 21) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 22) (26, 15) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 6) (26, 4) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 10) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 22) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (3, 23) (3, 7) (3, 14) (2, 22) (2, 9) (22, 19) (22, 1) (22, 2) (22, 21) (24, 20) (24, 8) (24, 29) (5, 15) (28, 4) (28, 10) (6, 16) (6, 26) (6, 0) (6, 18) (14, 12) (14, 3) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (21, 12) (21, 27) (21, 15) (21, 22) (29, 24) (4, 26) (4, 13) (4, 28) (18, 25) (18, 6) (10, 13) (10, 28) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (1, 25, 18, 6) 
- Cycle 2: (1, 25, 18, 9) 
- Cycle 3: (1, 25, 18, 6, 16) 
- Cycle 4: (1, 25, 18, 6, 0) 
- Cycle 5: (1, 25, 18, 6, 26) 
- Cycle 6: (1, 25, 18, 6, 16, 27) 
- Cycle 7: (1, 25, 18, 6, 0, 7) 
- Cycle 8: (1, 25, 18, 6, 26, 15) 
- Cycle 9: (1, 25, 18, 6, 26, 19) 
- Cycle 10: (1, 25, 18, 6, 26, 13) 
- Cycle 11: (1, 25, 18, 6, 26, 4) 
- Cycle 12: (1, 25, 18, 6, 0, 7, 3) 
- Cycle 13: (1, 25, 18, 6, 26, 19, 27) 

Step 2: Identify chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 25, 18, 6, (16)>
- <1, 25, 18, 6, (0)>
- <1, 25, 18, 6, (26)>
- <1, 25, 18, 6, 26, (19)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 4 chordal 4-cycles identified, hence the final count is [4].
