Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 21) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 23) (1, 22) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 22) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 27) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 27) (0, 17) (0, 2) (20, 26) (20, 24) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 18) (2, 28) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 17) (18, 25) (7, 16) (7, 23) (12, 15) (12, 26) (26, 20) (26, 12) (26, 24) (28, 5) (28, 2) (24, 20) (24, 26) (24, 22) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 25) (15, 29) (15, 4) (4, 15) (16, 5) (16, 7) (16, 23) (21, 9) (21, 22) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 19) (29, 1) (29, 15) (25, 9) (25, 18) (25, 15) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 14) (14, 27) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 23) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 22) (23, 1) (23, 7) (23, 16) (23, 19) (22, 1) (22, 3) (22, 24) (22, 21) (22, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-25-15-4-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-9-25-18-17-0-2-13-8-11-27-10-15-29-1-3-6-10-11-8-13-2-28-5
        - Cycle 3: 5-16-23-19-13-2-18-1-29-15-12-26-24-22-17-0-2-28-5
        - Cycle 4: 9-25-18-17-0-2-13-8-11-27-10-15-29-1-3-6-10-11-8-13-2-28-5
        - Cycle 5: 16-23-19-13-2-18-1-29-15-12-26-24-22-17-0-2-28-5

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-25-15-4-5 has one chord (9, 15)
        - Cycle 2: 5-9-25-18-17-0-2-13-(8, 11)-27-10-15-29-1-3-6-10-11-8-13-2-28-5 has one chord (8, 11)
        - Cycle 3: 5-16-23-19-13-(2, 18)-1-29-15-12-26-24-22-17-0-2-28-5 has one chord (2, 18)
        - Cycle 4: 9-25-18-17-0-2-13-(8, 11)-27-10-15-29-1-3-6-10-11-8-13-2-28-5 has one chord (8, 11)
        - Cycle 5: 16-23-19-13-(2, 18)-1-29-15-12-26-24-22-17-0-2-28-5 has one chord (2, 18)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are [5] unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <5, 9, 25, 15>
        <5, 9, 25, 18>
        <5, 16, 23, 19>
        <9, 25, 18, 17>
        <16, 23, 19, 13>
