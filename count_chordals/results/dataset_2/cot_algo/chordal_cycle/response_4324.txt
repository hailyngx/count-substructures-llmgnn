Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle 1: 5-9-6-1-5
2. Cycle 2: 5-9-4-6-5
3. Cycle 3: 5-9-7-3-5
4. Cycle 4: 9-6-3-7-9
5. Cycle 5: 9-1-6-3-9
6. Cycle 6: 9-4-6-1-9
7. Cycle 7: 6-1-5-4-6
8. Cycle 8: 6-1-9-4-6
9. Cycle 9: 6-3-7-2-6
10. Cycle 10: 1-5-9-7-1
11. Cycle 11: 1-6-9-4-1
12. Cycle 12: 3-7-9-5-3
13. Cycle 13: 3-6-1-5-3
14. Cycle 14: 4-9-7-3-4
15. Cycle 15: 4-6-9-1-4
16. Cycle 16: 8-3-7-2-8
17. Cycle 17: 8-4-9-7-8
18. Cycle 18: 2-6-9-5-2
19. Cycle 19: 2-6-1-5-2
20. Cycle 20: 2-8-4-9-2
21. Cycle 21: 0-4-9-7-0
22. Cycle 22: 0-4-6-1-0
23. Cycle 23: 0-2-7-3-0
24. Cycle 24: 7-9-4-8-7

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has chord (6, 1)
- Cycle 2 has chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 3 has chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 4 has no chord
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has no chord
- Cycle 7 has chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 8 has chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 9 has chord (3, 7)
- Cycle 10 has no chord
- Cycle 11 has no chord
- Cycle 12 has chord (3, 5)
- Cycle 13 has chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 14 has chord (3, 7)
- Cycle 15 has chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 16 has no chord
- Cycle 17 has no chord
- Cycle 18 has chord (6, 5)
- Cycle 19 has chord (6, 1)
- Cycle 20 has chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 21 has chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 22 has chord (4, 6)
- Cycle 23 has no chord
- Cycle 24 has chord (9, 4)

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <5, 6, 1, 9> (Chord: (6, 1))
- <5, 9, 4, 6> (Chord: (9, 4))
- <5, 9, 7, 3> (Chord: (9, 7))
- <4, 6, 9, 1> (Chord: (4, 6))
- <3, 1, 6, 5> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <7, 3, 9, 5> (Chord: (3, 5))
- <9, 4, 7, 3> (Chord: (9, 7))
- <9, 6, 1, 5> (Chord: (6, 1))
