Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 14) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 15) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 15) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (15, 1) (15, 3) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 17) (18, 7) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 0) (13, 9) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 14) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 8) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 15, 1, 10, 2, 7, 11, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 13, 14, 16, 6, 14, 4, 9)
- Cycle 3: (6, 8, 0, 19, 10, 17, 18, 16, 6)
- Cycle 4: (7, 2, 10, 1, 15, 3, 9, 4, 14, 13, 7)
- Cycle 5: (11, 5, 9, 13, 14, 16, 6, 14, 4, 9, 11)
- Cycle 6: (12, 19, 5, 9, 13, 14, 16, 6, 14, 4, 12)
- Cycle 7: (17, 18, 16, 6, 14, 4, 9, 5, 11, 7, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Checking Cycle 1: No chord found.
- Checking Cycle 2: Chord found: (9, 14).
- Checking Cycle 3: Chord found: (8, 19).
- Checking Cycle 4: Chord found: (10, 15).
- Checking Cycle 5: Chord found: (5, 16).
- Checking Cycle 6: No chord found.
- Checking Cycle 7: Chord found: (6, 17).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordless cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles <chord>:
- <5, 9, 3, 15, (1, 10), 2, 7, 11>
- <6, 8, 0, 19, (10, 17), 18, 16, 14, 4, 9>
- <7, 2, 10, 1, 15, (3, 9), 4, 14, 13>
