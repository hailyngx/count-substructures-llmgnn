Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 16) (9, 6) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (3, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 13) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 13) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 15) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 18) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 4) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 2) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (12, 6) (12, 8) (18, 13) (18, 7) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 6, 2, 10, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 10, 13, 17, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 16, 1, 11, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 16, 15, 14, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (6, 9, 10, 13, 6)
        - Cycle 6: (6, 12, 8, 2, 6)
        - Cycle 7: (9, 6, 2, 8, 9)
        - Cycle 8: (10, 13, 17, 7, 10)
        - Cycle 9: (13, 17, 7, 1, 13)
        - Cycle 10: (13, 17, 4, 11, 13)
        - Cycle 11: (13, 17, 7, 18, 13)
        - Cycle 12: (16, 1, 7, 11, 16)
        - Cycle 13: (16, 5, 10, 9, 16)
        - Cycle 14: (16, 15, 8, 12, 16)
        - Cycle 15: (17, 13, 10, 9, 17)
        - Cycle 16: (17, 7, 1, 16, 17)
        - Cycle 17: (17, 4, 2, 6, 17)
        - Cycle 18: (2, 6, 12, 8, 2)
        - Cycle 19: (2, 13, 17, 7, 2)
        - Cycle 20: (2, 4, 11, 1, 2)
        - Cycle 21: (2, 4, 17, 13, 2)
        - Cycle 22: (7, 1, 16, 15, 7)
        - Cycle 23: (7, 11, 4, 17, 7)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - <1, (5, 10)>
        - <2, (13, 17)>
        - <3, (16, 15)>
        - <4, (6, 12)>
        - <5, (6, 9)>
        - <6, (8, 2)>
        - <7, (6, 2)>
        - <8, (7, 1)>
        - <9, (4, 11)>
        - <10, (13, 18)>
        - <11, (16, 5)>
        - <12, (7, 11)>
        - <13, (11, 1)>
        - <14, (10, 13)>
        - <15, (16, 1)>
        - <16, (4, 17)>
        - <17, (2, 8)>
        - <18, (2, 6)>
        - <19, (2, 13)>
        - <20, (17, 7)>
        - <21, (7, 17)>
        - <22, (15, 14)>
        - <23, (7, 14)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 23 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [23].
