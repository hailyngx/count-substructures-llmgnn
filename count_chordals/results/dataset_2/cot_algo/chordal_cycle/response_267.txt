Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:

<11, 6, 5, 13> (Chord: (11, 21))
<6, 8, 4, 2> (Chord: (6, 14))
<6, 8, 28, 13> (Chord: (6, 11))
<6, 11, 21, 25> (Chord: (11, 6))
<6, 14, 16, 7> (Chord: (14, 6))
<7, 10, 14, 16> (Chord: (10, 7))
<16, 24, 0, 1> (Chord: (24, 16))
<17, 29, 24, 8> (Chord: (29, 17))
<18, 27, 4, 12> (Chord: (18, 10))
<26, 19, 28, 8> (Chord: (26, 15))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [9]

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<11, 21, (11, 6), 25>
