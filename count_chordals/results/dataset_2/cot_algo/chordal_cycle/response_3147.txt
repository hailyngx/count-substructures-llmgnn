Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-3-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-6-7-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-6-7-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-3-7-5
- Cycle 5: 5-1-3-2-5
- Cycle 6: 5-1-7-6-5
- Cycle 7: 9-6-7-5-9
- Cycle 8: 9-1-7-5-9
- Cycle 9: 6-7-5-9-6
- Cycle 10: 6-7-1-5-6
- Cycle 11: 6-3-1-5-6
- Cycle 12: 6-3-7-5-6
- Cycle 13: 1-3-7-5-1
- Cycle 14: 1-7-5-9-1
- Cycle 15: 1-7-6-5-1
- Cycle 16: 3-7-5-9-3
- Cycle 17: 3-7-6-5-3

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 4: 5-1-3-7-5, Chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 5: 5-1-3-2-5, Chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 8: 9-1-7-5-9, Chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 9: 6-7-5-9-6, Chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 10: 6-7-1-5-6, Chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 15: 1-7-6-5-1, Chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 17: 3-7-6-5-3, Chord: (3, 6)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, (1, 3)>
<5, (1, 3)>
<9, (1, 7)>
<6, (6, 9)>
<6, (1, 7)>
<1, (1, 6)>
<3, (3, 6)>
