Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 13) (29, 10) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 15) (25, 12) (1, 14) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 7) (15, 25) (15, 19) (20, 19) (20, 11) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 11) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 12) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 16) (26, 3) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 17) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 24) (9, 27) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 29) (13, 4) (24, 2) (24, 9) (10, 29) (10, 0) (23, 1) (23, 26) (23, 21) (11, 20) (11, 18) (11, 5) (19, 15) (19, 20) (19, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (16, 22) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 28) (8, 16) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 27) (21, 23) (21, 12) (27, 9) (27, 28) (12, 25) (12, 14) (12, 28) (12, 21) (6, 4) (6, 16) 

Response:
[8]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <1, (28, 9), 27>

Explanation: 
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: 1-14-18-4-13 (length 5)
- Cycle 2: 1-7-3-25-12 (length 5)
- Cycle 3: 1-7-5-11-18 (length 5)
- Cycle 4: 1-7-5-2-29 (length 5)
- Cycle 5: 1-14-18-11-5 (length 5)
- Cycle 6: 1-14-0-10-29 (length 5)
- Cycle 7: 1-14-0-9-28 (length 5)
- Cycle 8: 1-23-26-3-7 (length 5)
- Cycle 9: 1-23-26-22-9 (length 5)
- Cycle 10: 1-23-21-12-28 (length 5)
- Cycle 11: 14-18-11-5-7-3-25-12 (length 8)
- Cycle 12: 14-18-4-6-16-17-26-22 (length 8)

Step 2:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: 4-13
- Cycle 2 has one chord: 3-25
- Cycle 3 has one chord: 7-5
- Cycle 4 has one chord: 2-29
- Cycle 5 has one chord: 11-18
- Cycle 6 has one chord: 10-29
- Cycle 7 has one chord: 0-9
- Cycle 10 has one chord: 21-12

Step 3:
- 8 chordal 4-cycles found

Therefore, the final count is [8].
