Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 18) (1, 16) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (18, 14) (18, 17) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 11) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 8) (19, 11) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 9) (0, 19) (0, 13) (11, 15) (11, 19) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 2) (16, 4) (16, 1) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 19) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 0) (6, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
1. Cycle 1: 7-4-13-1-7
2. Cycle 2: 14-17-5-2-14
3. Cycle 3: 17-18-14-15-17
4. Cycle 4: 10-17-14-12-10
5. Cycle 5: 17-10-9-19-17
6. Cycle 6: 3-7-4-16-3
7. Cycle 7: 10-15-11-19-10
8. Cycle 8: 9-7-3-12-9
9. Cycle 9: 14-15-11-19-14
10. Cycle 10: 13-1-16-4-13
11. Cycle 11: 2-5-3-12-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <7, (4, 13), 1>
- <14, (17, 18), 15>
- <17, (10, 9), 14>
- <17, (18, 14), 15>
- <10, (17, 14), 12>
- <17, (10, 9), 19>
- <15, (14, 11), 10>
- <9, (7, 3), 12>
- <14, (15, 11), 19>
- <13, (1, 16), 4>
- <5, (3, 12), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
