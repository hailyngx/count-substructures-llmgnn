Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 3) (22, 14) (22, 3) (22, 21) (10, 19) (10, 23) (11, 27) (11, 4) (2, 6) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 8) (4, 11) (4, 28) (4, 5) (8, 18) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 27) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 25) (26, 13) (26, 12) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 24) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 9) (28, 4) (28, 8) (7, 16) (7, 29) (25, 14) (25, 9) (25, 29) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 3) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 9) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 21) (21, 22) (21, 16) (21, 24) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 27) (23, 10) (23, 5) (23, 27) (9, 17) (9, 25) (9, 19) (9, 20) (15, 18) (27, 11) (27, 8) (27, 29) (27, 23) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 20) (20, 8) (20, 9) (20, 3) (12, 0) (12, 26) (12, 24) (24, 1) (24, 5) (24, 21) (24, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 11, 27, 23, 5, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 11, 27, 23, 10, 19, 5, 4)
- Cycle 3: (8, 18, 17, 1, 13, 3, 20, 8)
- Cycle 4: (8, 18, 17, 1, 24, 21, 16, 0, 14, 22, 3, 20, 8)
- Cycle 5: (8, 18, 17, 9, 19, 5, 23, 27, 11, 4, 5, 19, 9, 17, 1, 24, 5, 3, 13, 26, 12, 24, 21, 16, 7, 29, 25, 14, 0, 16, 21, 22, 14, 19, 9, 20, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (13, 3), 7> (Cycle 1) - 1 chord
- <10, (19, 5), 23> (Cycle 2) - 1 chord
- <17, (1, 13), 9> (Cycle 3) - 1 chord
- <21, (16, 0), 22> (Cycle 4) - 1 chord
- <8, (18, 17), 20> (Cycle 5) - 1 chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
