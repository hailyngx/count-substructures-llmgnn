Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycles of length 4:
<5, 3, 7, 13, 5> with chords (5, 7)
<5, 3, 6, 13, 5> with chords (3, 6)
<9, 8, 4, 12, 9> with chords (8, 12)
<5, 9, 8, 11, 5> with chords (9, 11)
<11, 14, 10, 13, 11> with chords (10, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 3, 7, 13, 5> with chords (5, 7)
<9, 8, 4, 12, 9> with chords (8, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Final result: [3]
