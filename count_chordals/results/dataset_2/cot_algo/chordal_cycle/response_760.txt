Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 2) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more found in the graph:  
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 7, 4> with chord (0, 7)  
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 6> with chord (5, 9)  
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 13, 10> with chord (5, 13)  
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 8, 1> with chord (5, 8)  
- Cycle 5: <0, 10, 13, 3> with chord (10, 13)  
- Cycle 6: <0, 11, 8, 1> with chord (8, 11)  
- Cycle 7: <0, 11, 8, 5> with chord (8, 11)  
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 7, 5> with chord (4, 7)  
- Cycle 9: <1, 4, 13, 3> with chord (4, 13)  
- Cycle 10: <1, 8, 5, 7> with chord (5, 7)  
- Cycle 11: <2, 0, 5, 8> with chord (0, 5)  
- Cycle 12: <2, 0, 10, 13> with chord (0, 10)  
- Cycle 13: <2, 12, 9, 6> with chord (9, 12)  
- Cycle 14: <2, 12, 14, 4> with chord (12, 14)  
- Cycle 15: <3, 6, 9, 12> with chord (6, 9)  
- Cycle 16: <3, 4, 7, 5> with chord (4, 7)  
- Cycle 17: <3, 10, 13, 5> with chord (10, 13)  
- Cycle 18: <3, 12, 14, 4> with chord (12, 14)  
- Cycle 19: <5, 7, 1, 8> with chord (7, 8)  
- Cycle 20: <5, 9, 6, 13> with chord (9, 13)  
- Cycle 21: <6, 9, 12, 3> with chord (9, 12)  
- Cycle 22: <6, 13, 4, 7> with chord (13, 7)  
- Cycle 23: <8, 5, 0, 10> with chord (5, 10)  
- Cycle 24: <10, 0, 2, 12> with chord (0, 12)  
- Cycle 25: <13, 4, 1, 8> with chord (4, 8)  
- Cycle 26: <13, 10, 2, 12> with chord (10, 12)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- Unique Chordal 4-cycles (with exactly one chord):  
<0, 5, 7, 4> (0, 7)  
<0, 10, 13, 3> (10, 13)  
<0, 11, 8, 1> (8, 11)  
<2, 12, 14, 4> (12, 14)  
<3, 10, 13, 5> (10, 13)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.  
There are [5] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
