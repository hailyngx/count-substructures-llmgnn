Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 8) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (4, 9, 14, 6, 4)
- Cycle 2: (9, 14, 0, 12, 9)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 14, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (13, 5, 9, 4, 13)
- Cycle 5: (13, 12, 0, 14, 13)
- Cycle 6: (3, 13, 5, 9, 3)
- Cycle 7: (11, 4, 9, 14, 11)
- Cycle 8: (11, 7, 14, 0, 11)
- Cycle 9: (8, 9, 14, 0, 8)
- Cycle 10: (1, 4, 9, 14, 1)
- Cycle 11: (6, 12, 0, 14, 6)
- Cycle 12: (6, 14, 7, 11, 6)
- Cycle 13: (6, 1, 4, 9, 6)
- Cycle 14: (10, 9, 14, 0, 10)
- Cycle 15: (2, 4, 9, 14, 2)
- Cycle 16: (2, 3, 13, 5, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (9, 6), 14> has a chord (9, 6)
- <4, (9, 14), 1> has a chord (9, 14)
- <6, (12, 0), 14> has a chord (12, 0)
- <8, (9, 14), 0> has a chord (9, 14)
- <10, (9, 0), 14> has a chord (9, 0)
- <13, (5, 9), 3> has a chord (5, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [10]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <3, (9, 5), 13>
