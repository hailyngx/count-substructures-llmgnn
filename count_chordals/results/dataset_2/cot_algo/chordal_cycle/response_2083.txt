Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 5, 4, 2, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 8, 1, 7, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 0, 9, 3, 6)
- Cycle 4: (9, 7, 2, 4, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 0, 3, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (1, 7, 5, 8, 1)
- Cycle 7: (3, 9, 7, 1, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 0, 6, 5, 3)
- Cycle 9: (4, 2, 7, 5, 4)
- Cycle 10: (7, 1, 8, 5, 7)
- Cycle 11: (8, 6, 0, 9, 8)
- Cycle 12: (5, 4, 3, 0, 5)
- Cycle 13: (2, 7, 1, 8, 2)
- Cycle 14: (0, 3, 9, 7, 0)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 7).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (0, 9).
- Cycle 4 has a chord (3, 4).
- Cycle 5 has a chord (0, 3).
- Cycle 6 has a chord (5, 8).
- Cycle 7 has a chord (1, 9).
- Cycle 8 has a chord (0, 5).
- Cycle 9 has a chord (2, 7).
- Cycle 10 has a chord (1, 8).
- Cycle 11 has a chord (0, 9).
- Cycle 12 has a chord (3, 4).
- Cycle 13 has a chord (1, 8).
- Cycle 14 has a chord (3, 7).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal cycles:
There are 14 cycles found with exactly one chord, thus the number of chordal 4-cycles is [14].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<2, (1, 7), 6)>
<3, (0, 9), 6)>
<4, (3, 4), 9)>
<5, (0, 3), 9)>
<6, (5, 8), 1)>
<7, (1, 9), 3)>
<8, (0, 5), 3)>
<9, (2, 7), 4)>
<10, (1, 8), 7)>
<11, (0, 9), 8)>
<12, (3, 4), 12)>
<13, (1, 8), 13)>
<14, (3, 7), 14)>
