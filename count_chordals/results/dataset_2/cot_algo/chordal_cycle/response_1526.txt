Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 8) (21, 22) (10, 17) (10, 24) (17, 10) (17, 20) (17, 8) (17, 27) (8, 21) (8, 17) (8, 29) (8, 22) (23, 2) (23, 25) (23, 0) (4, 19) (4, 6) (4, 26) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 0) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 24) (13, 6) (26, 4) (26, 13) (26, 16) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 20) (20, 17) (20, 5) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 28) (15, 19) (9, 21) (9, 29) (9, 11) (29, 8) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 0) (27, 17) (27, 29) (14, 18) (14, 5) (16, 26) (3, 28) (3, 0) (28, 20) (28, 3) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 25) (11, 9) (2, 23) (22, 21) (22, 8) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 29) (19, 6) (0, 23) (0, 18) (0, 29) (0, 3) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 6) (7, 20) (7, 28) (7, 24) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 28) (24, 10) (24, 13) (24, 7) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19) (6, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- <0, 18, 1, 21, 8> 
- <0, 3, 28, 20, 17>
- <0, 23, 2, 22, 21>
- <0, 23, 25, 6, 4> 
- <1, 21, 9, 29, 8> 
- <4, 19, 15, 9, 29>
- <5, 13, 24, 7, 28>
- <5, 14, 18, 0, 23> 
- <6, 25, 23, 0, 18>
- <8, 21, 22, 2, 23> 
- <10, 24, 13, 26, 4> 
- <12, 5, 20, 7, 24>
- <17, 20, 5, 13, 26> 
- <17, 27, 29, 9, 21>
- <19, 29, 0, 18, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 18, 1, 21, 8> has exactly one chord (21, 8), forming a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 18, (21, 8), 1>
- <0, 3, 28, 20, 17> has exactly one chord (20, 3), forming a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 3, (20, 17), 28>
- <0, 23, 2, 22, 21> has exactly one chord (22, 23), forming a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 23, (22, 21), 2>
- <0, 23, 25, 6, 4> has exactly one chord (6, 25), forming a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 6, (25, 4), 23>
- <4, 19, 15, 9, 29> has exactly one chord (15, 9), forming a chordal 4-cycle: <4, 15, (9, 29), 19>
- <5, 13, 24, 7, 28> has exactly one chord (13, 24), forming a chordal 4-cycle: <5, 13, (24, 7), 28>
- <17, 27, 29, 9, 21> has exactly one chord (29, 27), forming a chordal 4-cycle: <17, 27, (29, 9), 21>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
