Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 15) (14, 23) (17, 14) (17, 4) (17, 21) (15, 14) (15, 21) (20, 7) (20, 1) (20, 22) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 5) (7, 20) (12, 29) (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 26) (11, 29) (28, 11) (28, 26) (28, 8) (26, 11) (26, 28) (26, 2) (26, 8) (10, 2) (6, 24) (6, 4) (6, 23) (24, 11) (24, 6) (24, 22) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 27) (25, 0) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 22) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 4) (2, 26) (2, 10) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 3) (29, 12) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 27) (3, 27) (3, 16) (3, 22) (3, 18) (1, 20) (1, 8) (1, 25) (1, 19) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 13) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (13, 19) (18, 3) (18, 16) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 18) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 25) (22, 3) (23, 14) (23, 6) (21, 17) (21, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (14, 17, 21, 15, 14)
- Cycle 2: (14, 0, 5, 8, 1, 20, 22, 24, 6, 23, 14)
- Cycle 3: (11, 28, 26, 2, 10, 2, 26, 8, 1, 25, 29, 27, 3, 22, 24, 11)
- Cycle 4: (11, 24, 22, 25, 1, 8, 26, 11)
- Cycle 5: (9, 25, 0, 5, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 27, 29, 25, 0, 14, 23, 6, 24, 11, 26, 8, 5, 9)
- Cycle 7: (3, 27, 29, 25, 22, 3)
- Cycle 8: (16, 9, 4, 6, 24, 22, 3, 18, 16)
- Cycle 9: (1, 20, 7, 20, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 19, 4, 6, 24, 22, 25, 1)
- Cycle 11: (4, 19, 13, 19, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (6, 23), 24, 22, 25> has exactly one chord (6, 23)
- <11, (26, 2), 10, 2, 26, 8, 1, 25, 29, 27, 3, 22, 24> has exactly one chord (26, 2)
- <9, 25, 0, (14, 23), 6, 24, 11, 26, 8, 5> has exactly one chord (14, 23)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]
