Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 11) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 16) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 14) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 18) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 19) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 13) (2, 9) (2, 4) (11, 15) (11, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 7) (18, 3) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (1, 10) (1, 11) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 11, 1)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 2, 4)
- Cycle 3: (7, 12, 16, 5)
- Cycle 4: (10, 17, 13, 3)
- Cycle 5: (8, 4, 2, 9)
- Cycle 6: (0, 15, 11, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord (11, 3) 
- Cycle 2 has a chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (12, 7)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (13, 17)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (2, 9)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (11, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <3, 15, 11, 1> (chord: (3, 11))
- <5, 9, 2, 4> (chord: (5, 9))
- <7, 12, 16, 5> (chord: (7, 12))
- <10, 17, 13, 3> (chord: (13, 17))
- <8, 4, 2, 9> (chord: (9, 2))
- <0, 15, 11, 1> (chord: (11, 0))
