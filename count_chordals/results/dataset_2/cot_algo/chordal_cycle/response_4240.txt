Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 0, 10, 7, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 3, 6, 1, 14, 9, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 2, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 9, 2, 13, 12, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 9, 12, 13, 2, 9, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 10, 0, 5, 4, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 10, 1, 6, 3, 7)
- Cycle 8: (9, 7, 3, 6, 1, 10, 2, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 7, 10, 1, 6, 3, 13, 12, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 7, 10, 0, 5, 4, 2, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 12, 13, 2, 4, 5, 0, 10, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The unique chordal 4-cycle found:
    - Cycle 3: <4, (7, 2), 9>

Step 3: The number of chordless cycles found is [10].
