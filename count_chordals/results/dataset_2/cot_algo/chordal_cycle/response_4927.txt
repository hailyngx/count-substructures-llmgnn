        - Chordal 4-cycle 14 <5, 1, 7, 19> with chord (1, 8)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 15 <1, 8, 18, 14> with chord (8, 9)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 16 <17, 12, 19, 5> with chord (12, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        There are 16 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
