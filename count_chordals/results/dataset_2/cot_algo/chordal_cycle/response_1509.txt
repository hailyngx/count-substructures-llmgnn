Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 4) (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 19) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 19) (2, 19) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 6) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 14) (12, 1) (4, 15) (4, 18) (4, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 17) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 1) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 6) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 0) (14, 16) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 4) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 3-0-19-15-3
        - Cycle 2: 8-5-9-13-8
        - Cycle 3: 10-3-0-6-10
        - Cycle 4: 9-5-8-13-9
        - Cycle 5: 4-15-19-13-4
        - Cycle 6: 14-16-6-18-14

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: Chord (0, 15)
        - Cycle 2: Chord (5, 13)
        - Cycle 3: Chord (3, 6)
        - Cycle 4: Chord (5, 13)
        - Cycle 5: Chord (15, 19)
        - Cycle 6: Chord (6, 16)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        - Number of chordal 4-cycles: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <1, (0, 15), 3)>
        <2, (5, 13), 8)>
        <3, (3, 6), 10)>
        <4, (5, 13), 9)>
        <5, (15, 19), 4)>
        <6, (6, 16), 14)>
