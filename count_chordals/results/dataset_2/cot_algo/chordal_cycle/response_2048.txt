Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 4), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (1, 14), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (9, 7), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (2, 17), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (11, 13), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (12, 16), 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (9, 14), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (15, 19), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (3, 7), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (4, 17), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <11, (10, 13), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <12, (0, 16), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <13, (15, 17), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <14, (1, 2), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <15, (0, 13), 15>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found, thus the final count is [15].
