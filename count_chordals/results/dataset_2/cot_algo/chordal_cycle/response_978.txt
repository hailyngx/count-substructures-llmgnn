Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle: 1-3-5-4-1
2. Cycle: 1-6-5-4-1
3. Cycle: 1-7-5-4-1
4. Cycle: 1-7-8-9-1
5. Cycle: 1-3-4-6-1
6. Cycle: 1-3-4-2-1
7. Cycle: 5-4-6-7-5
8. Cycle: 5-7-8-9-5
9. Cycle: 5-3-4-6-5
10. Cycle: 8-9-7-6-8
11. Cycle: 8-7-6-4-8
12. Cycle: 8-7-1-6-8
13. Cycle: 7-5-6-4-7

Step 2:
Identifying the cycles with exactly one chord:
1. Cycle: 1-3-5-4-1, Chord (3, 4)
2. Cycle: 1-6-5-4-1, Chord (6, 4)
3. Cycle: 1-7-5-4-1, Chord (7, 4)
4. Cycle: 1-7-8-9-1, Chord (7, 9)
5. Cycle: 1-3-4-6-1, Chord (3, 6)
6. Cycle: 5-4-6-7-5, Chord (4, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we see that there are [6] such cycles.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (3, 4)>
<1, (6, 4)>
<1, (7, 4)>
<1, (7, 9)>
<1, (3, 6)>
<5, (4, 7)>
