Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (5, 2, 8, 3, 5)
- (5, 1, 4, 7, 3, 5)
- (2, 8, 3, 6, 2)
- (2, 6, 4, 7, 3, 2)
- (7, 4, 6, 3, 7)
- (8, 3, 6, 4, 8)
- (1, 5, 0, 8, 1)
- (4, 6, 0, 5, 4)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <5, (3, 8), 2>
- <5, (1, 4), 7>
- <2, (8, 6), 4>
- <2, (6, 4), 7>
- <7, (4, 6), 3>
- <8, (6, 4), 3>
- <1, (0, 8), 5>
- <4, (0, 6), 5>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
