Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 8) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 17) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 10) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 15) (15, 18) (15, 1) (9, 11) (9, 17) (19, 0) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 3) (7, 5) (7, 10) (2, 11) (2, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (16, 8, 11, 9, 16)
- Cycle 2: (16, 1, 6, 5, 16)
- Cycle 3: (4, 13, 16, 1, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 13, 3, 0, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 17, 9, 11, 4)
- Cycle 6: (0, 14, 5, 6, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 10, 6, 1, 0)
- Cycle 8: (0, 3, 8, 16, 0)
- Cycle 9: (13, 16, 8, 11, 13)
- Cycle 10: (13, 4, 17, 9, 13)
- Cycle 11: (13, 3, 12, 17, 13)
- Cycle 12: (17, 4, 18, 15, 17)
- Cycle 13: (17, 9, 11, 2, 17)
- Cycle 14: (10, 6, 1, 15, 10)
- Cycle 15: (10, 14, 5, 7, 10)
- Cycle 16: (10, 0, 3, 12, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (6, 14), 16>
- <4, (3, 13), 17>
- <9, (2, 11), 17>
- <10, (5, 7), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 12 chordless 4-cycles. So, the final count is [12].
