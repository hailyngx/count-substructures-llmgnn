Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 2, 3) with edges (1, 6), (6, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1).
- Cycle 2: (1, 2, 3, 5) with edges (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 5), (5, 1).
- Cycle 3: (1, 2, 5, 0) with edges (1, 2), (2, 5), (5, 0), (0, 1).
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 5, 0) with edges (1, 6), (6, 5), (5, 0), (0, 1).
- Cycle 5: (1, 6, 2, 5) with edges (1, 6), (6, 2), (2, 5), (5, 1).
- Cycle 6: (2, 3, 8, 5) with edges (2, 3), (3, 8), (8, 5), (5, 2).
- Cycle 7: (2, 5, 0, 1) with edges (2, 5), (5, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2).
- Cycle 8: (2, 5, 3, 8) with edges (2, 5), (5, 3), (3, 8), (8, 2).
- Cycle 9: (3, 2, 5, 0) with edges (3, 2), (2, 5), (5, 0), (0, 3).
- Cycle 10: (3, 5, 8, 0) with edges (3, 5), (5, 8), (8, 0), (0, 3).
- Cycle 11: (5, 6, 2, 3) with edges (5, 6), (6, 2), (2, 3), (3, 5).
- Cycle 12: (5, 6, 1, 2) with edges (5, 6), (6, 1), (1, 2), (2, 5).

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 6, 2, 3> (Chord: (1, 2)) 
- <1, 2, 3, 5> (Chord: (2, 3))
- <1, 2, 5, 0> (Chord: (1, 5))
- <1, 6, 5, 0> (Chord: (5, 6))
- <1, 6, 2, 5> (Chord: (2, 6))
- <2, 3, 8, 5> (Chord: (2, 8))
- <2, 5, 0, 1> (Chord: (2, 0))
- <2, 5, 3, 8> (Chord: (2, 3))
- <3, 2, 5, 0> (Chord: (3, 5))
- <3, 5, 8, 0> (Chord: (3, 8))
- <5, 6, 2, 3> (Chord: (5, 2))
- <5, 6, 1, 2> (Chord: (1, 6))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
[12]

So, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, 6, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 5, 0>
<1, 6, 5, 0>
<1, 6, 2, 5>
<2, 3, 8, 5>
<2, 5, 0, 1>
<2, 5, 3, 8>
<3, 2, 5, 0>
<3, 5, 8, 0>
<5, 6, 2, 3>
<5, 6, 1, 2>
