Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-1-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-3-6-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-5-6-0
- Cycle 4: 1-5-3-4-1
- Cycle 5: 2-5-6-0-2
- Cycle 6: 2-5-1-0-2
- Cycle 7: 2-6-3-5-2
- Cycle 8: 3-5-4-8-3
- Cycle 9: 4-9-8-7-4
- Cycle 10: 7-8-1-5-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 5-3
- Cycle 2 has a chord 5-3
- Cycle 3 has a chord 5-1
- Cycle 4 has a chord 5-3
- Cycle 5 has a chord 5-2
- Cycle 6 has a chord 5-1
- Cycle 7 has a chord 5-6
- Cycle 8 has a chord 5-4
- Cycle 9 has a chord 9-8
- Cycle 10 has a chord 8-5

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final answer is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 5, 1, 3>
<0, 5, 3, 6>
<0, 1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 3, 4>
<2, 5, 6, 0>
<2, 5, 1, 0>
<2, 6, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 4, 8>
<4, 9, 8, 7>
<7, 8, 1, 5>
