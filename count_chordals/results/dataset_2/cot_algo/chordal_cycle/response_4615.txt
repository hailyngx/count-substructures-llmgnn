Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - <1, (5, 9), 3, 20>: Chord: (5, 9)
        - <2, (5, 9), 3, 16>: Chord: (5, 9)
        - <3, (5, 9), 3, 20, (20, 21)>: Chords: (5, 9), (20, 21)
        - <4, (5, 9), 3, 16, (16, 26)>: Chords: (5, 9), (16, 26)
        - <5, (5, 6), (6, 11), 15>: Chord: (6, 11)
        - <6, (5, 23), (23, 13), 18>: Chord: (23, 13)
        - <7, (5, 22), (22, 17), 28>: Chord: (22, 17)
        - <8, (9, 3), 20, 21>: No chord
        - <9, (9, 3), 16, 26>: No chord
        - <10, (0, 7), 14, 21>: No chord
        - <11, (0, 13), 23, 28>: No chord
        - <12, (27, 28), 23, 7>: No chord
        - <13, (2, 29), 4, 13>: No chord
        - <14, (2, 25), 10, 0>: No chord
        - <15, (6, 5), 23, 13>: No chord
        - <16, (6, 8), 21, 14>: No chord
        - <17, (14, 7), 0, 10>: No chord
        - <18, (17, 28), 23, 13>: No chord
        - <19, (13, 0), 10, 25>: No chord
        - <20, (4, 29), 2, 25>: No chord
        - <21, (22, 5), 9, 3>: No chord
        - <22, (1, 7), 0, 13>: No chord
        - <23, (11, 6), 5, 23>: No chord
        - <24, (23, 7), 1, 11>: No chord
        - <25, (19, 7), 0, 10>: No chord
        - <26, (28, 23), 13, 4>: No chord
        - <27, (21, 14), 7, 0>: No chord
        - <28, (18, 13), 0, 10>: No chord
        - <29, (24, 22), 5, 9>: No chord
        - <30, (16, 26), 12, 19>: No chord
        - <31, (15, 11), 6, 5>: No chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There are 31 chordless 4-cycles found.
        
        Therefore, the final answer is [31].
