Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 3) (4, 15) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 17) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 3) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 18) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 0) (15, 4) (15, 2) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (0, 19) (0, 16) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (14, 11) (14, 19) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 16) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 1) (18, 6) (18, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
   
   - Cycle 1: (7, 9, 2, 3, 7)
   - Cycle 2: (9, 2, 3, 4, 15, 9)
   - Cycle 3: (2, 3, 4, 15, 2)
   - Cycle 4: (6, 16, 0, 19, 6)
   - Cycle 5: (7, 8, 5, 19, 7)
   - Cycle 6: (7, 12, 17, 13, 16, 7)
   - Cycle 7: (10, 11, 3, 2, 9, 10)
   - Cycle 8: (17, 12, 3, 2, 19, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

   - Cycle 1 has two chords: (7, 2) and (9, 3)
   - Cycle 2 has one chord: (2, 15)
   - Cycle 3 has one chord: (3, 15)
   - Cycle 4 has one chord: (6, 19)
   - Cycle 5 has one chord: (8, 19)
   - Cycle 6 has two chords: (7, 13) and (12, 16)
   - Cycle 7 has one chord: (11, 10)
   - Cycle 8 has one chord: (17, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

   - After removing the cycles with more than one chord, the chordless cycles are: Cycle 2 and Cycle 3.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
   - Cycle 2: <9, 2, 3, 4>
   - Cycle 3: <2, 3, 4, 15>
