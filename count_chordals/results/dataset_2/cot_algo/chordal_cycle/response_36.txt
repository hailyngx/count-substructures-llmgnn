Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1-5-8-2-1
2. Cycle 1-5-3-0-1
3. Cycle 1-6-4-2-1
4. Cycle 1-6-7-0-1
5. Cycle 3-5-8-2-3
6. Cycle 3-5-7-0-3
7. Cycle 3-1-6-4-3
8. Cycle 3-1-5-8-3
9. Cycle 6-4-2-3-6
10. Cycle 6-4-9-7-6
11. Cycle 6-4-2-8-6
12. Cycle 6-7-0-3-6

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. Cycle <1, (2, 8), 3>
2. Cycle <1, (6, 7), 0>
3. Cycle <1, (3, 5), 8>
4. Cycle <3, (1, 6), 4>
5. Cycle <3, (5, 7), 0>
6. Cycle <6, (4, 2), 3>

Step 3:
The total number of unique chordal 4-cycles is [6].
