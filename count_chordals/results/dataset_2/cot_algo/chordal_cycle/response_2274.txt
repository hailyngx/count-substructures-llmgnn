Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-8-6
- Cycle 2: 6-13-12-7-6
- Cycle 3: 6-8-10-7-6
- Cycle 4: 6-2-4-5-6
- Cycle 5: 6-3-0-1-6
- Cycle 6: 7-12-13-0-7
- Cycle 7: 7-0-1-5-7
- Cycle 8: 7-10-14-3-7
- Cycle 9: 12-13-11-1-12
- Cycle 10: 0-9-8-6-0
- Cycle 11: 0-13-11-1-0
- Cycle 12: 0-3-14-7-0
- Cycle 13: 2-6-9-3-2
- Cycle 14: 4-5-1-11-4
- Cycle 15: 5-8-10-14-5

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <6, (9, 8), 6>
- Cycle 2 <6, (13, 7), 12>
- Cycle 3 <6, (8, 7), 10>
- Cycle 4 <6, (2, 5), 4>
- Cycle 5 <6, (3, 1), 0>
- Cycle 6 <7, (12, 0), 13>
- Cycle 7 <7, (0, 5), 1>
- Cycle 8 <7, (10, 3), 14>
- Cycle 9 <12, (13, 1), 11>
- Cycle 10 <0, (9, 8), 6>
- Cycle 11 <0, (13, 1), 11>
- Cycle 12 <0, (3, 7), 14>
- Cycle 13 <2, (6, 3), 9>
- Cycle 14 <4, (5, 1), 11>
- Cycle 15 <5, (8, 10), 14>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found = [15]
