Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8)

- Cycle 4: 4-6-0-4
- Cycle 5: 4-2-3-4
- Cycle 6: 7-0-6-7
- Cycle 7: 7-6-5-7
- Cycle 8: 7-6-1-7
- Cycle 9: 7-6-0-7
- Cycle 10: 7-2-3-7
- Cycle 11: 6-9-3-6
- Cycle 12: 6-1-9-6
- Cycle 13: 6-1-3-6
- Cycle 14: 6-0-4-6
- Cycle 15: 9-3-2-9
- Cycle 16: 1-6-0-1
- Cycle 17: 1-6-5-1
- Cycle 18: 1-6-9-1
- Cycle 19: 1-3-2-1
- Cycle 20: 3-9-6-3
- Cycle 21: 3-9-1-3
- Cycle 22: 3-9-2-3
- Cycle 23: 3-5-6-3
- Cycle 24: 5-6-0-5
- Cycle 25: 5-6-1-5
- Cycle 26: 5-6-3-5
- Cycle 27: 5-2-3-5
- Cycle 28: 2-4-6-2
- Cycle 29: 2-4-7-2
- Cycle 30: 2-4-3-2
- Cycle 31: 2-7-8-2
- Cycle 32: 8-7-0-8
- Cycle 33: 8-7-2-8
- Cycle 34: 8-3-1-8
- Cycle 35: 8-3-2-8

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (3, 2), 4>
- <2, (4, 3), 7>
- <3, (1, 6), 9>
- <4, (2, 7), 6>
- <5, (1, 6), 8>
- <6, (4, 9), 7>
- <7, (1, 6), 0>
- <8, (1, 2), 6>
- <9, (6, 3), 1>
- <10, (7, 2), 4>
- <11, (1, 5), 9>
- <12, (4, 0), 6>
- <13, (6, 9), 0>
- <14, (2, 3), 4>
- <15, (5, 6), 3>
- <16, (1, 6), 0>
- <17, (1, 5), 6>
- <18, (1, 9), 3>
- <19, (3, 2), 1>
- <20, (6, 3), 9>
- <21, (1, 3), 2>
- <22, (3, 6), 9>
- <23, (3, 5), 6>
- <24, (0, 6), 5>
- <25, (1, 6), 5>
- <26, (3, 6), 5>
- <27, (2, 5), 3>
- <28, (4, 6), 7>
- <29, (2, 7), 8>
- <30, (3, 1), 8>
- <31, (2, 8), 7>
- <32, (0, 8), 7>
- <33, (2, 8), 3>
- <34, (1, 8), 3>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
- There are 34 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [34].
