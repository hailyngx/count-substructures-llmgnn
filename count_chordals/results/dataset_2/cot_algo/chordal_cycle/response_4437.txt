Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 9) (1, 13) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 10) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 2) (19, 13) (19, 14) (9, 16) (9, 2) (12, 18) (12, 15) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (18, 1) (18, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 11-16-17-4-11
- Cycle 2: 11-16-9-2-11
- Cycle 3: 1-13-5-6-1
- Cycle 4: 1-13-7-2-1
- Cycle 5: 4-8-0-11-4
- Cycle 6: 4-8-0-17-4
- Cycle 7: 8-0-11-6-8
- Cycle 8: 8-0-17-6-8
- Cycle 9: 5-10-6-11-5
- Cycle 10: 5-10-6-2-5
- Cycle 11: 5-10-3-6-5
- Cycle 12: 13-1-7-2-13
- Cycle 13: 13-1-18-12-13
- Cycle 14: 0-11-10-6-0
- Cycle 15: 0-11-0-8-0
- Cycle 16: 2-6-17-11-2

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycles:
  - <1, (13, 7), 2, 5>
  - <4, (8, 0), 11, 17>
  - <5, (10, 6), 2, 13>
  - <6, (11, 10), 5, 2>
  - <8, (0, 17), 6, 4>
  - <13, (1, 18), 12, 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [16]
