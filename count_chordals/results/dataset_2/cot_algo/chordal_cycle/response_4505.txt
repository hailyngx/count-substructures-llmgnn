Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 11) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 7, 10, 6, 1)
- Cycle 3: (3, 6, 10, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 4, 8, 12, 3)
- Cycle 5: (4, 8, 13, 2, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 13, 9, 2, 4)
- Cycle 7: (6, 10, 7, 1, 6)
- Cycle 8: (0, 8, 13, 0)
- Cycle 9: (0, 5, 11, 7, 0)
- Cycle 10: (10, 7, 11, 14, 10)
- Cycle 11: (11, 8, 13, 0, 11)
- Cycle 12: (14, 4, 8, 13, 14)
- Cycle 13: (2, 13, 9, 2)
- Cycle 14: (2, 7, 11, 14, 2)
- Cycle 15: (9, 13, 12, 8, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <1, (3, 6), 7>: Cycle 2 has one chord (3, 6).
- <3, (4, 8), 12>: Cycle 4 has one chord (4, 8).
- <4, (2, 13), 9>: Cycle 5 has one chord (2, 13).
- <7, (2, 11), 14>: Cycle 14 has one chord (2, 11).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 15 cycles in total, and 4 of them have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [11].
