Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 2) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 10) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 1) (7, 13) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 17) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (14, 18) (14, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 10) (10, 18) (10, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 6) (19, 12) (19, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle: 5 - 9 - 4 - 12 - 5
2. Cycle: 3 - 0 - 8 - 2 - 3
3. Cycle: 18 - 5 - 1 - 0 - 18
4. Cycle: 18 - 5 - 9 - 4 - 18
5. Cycle: 18 - 3 - 0 - 8 - 18
6. Cycle: 18 - 2 - 8 - 11 - 18
7. Cycle: 8 - 11 - 12 - 4 - 8
8. Cycle: 4 - 13 - 7 - 1 - 4
9. Cycle: 17 - 6 - 14 - 18 - 17
10. Cycle: 13 - 7 - 1 - 0 - 13
11. Cycle: 13 - 6 - 17 - 11 - 13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <5, 9, 4, 12, 5> - Chord: (9, 4)
2. <3, 0, 8, 2, 3> - Chord: (0, 8)
3. <18, 5, 1, 0, 18> - Chord: (5, 0)
4. <18, 5, 9, 4, 18> - Chord: (5, 4)
5. <18, 3, 0, 8, 18> - Chord: (3, 8)
6. <18, 2, 8, 11, 18> - Chord: (2, 11)
7. <8, 11, 12, 4, 8> - Chord: (11, 12)
8. <4, 13, 7, 1, 4> - Chord: (13, 7)
9. <17, 6, 14, 18, 17> - Chord: (6, 14)
10. <13, 7, 1, 0, 13> - Chord: (7, 1)
11. <13, 6, 17, 11, 13> - Chord: (6, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
