Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
        There are several cycles present in the given graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-4-1-3-0
        - Cycle 2: 1-4-8-6-1
        - Cycle 3: 3-1-7-6-3
        - Cycle 4: 9-7-6-2-9
        - Cycle 5: 8-6-9-8
        - Cycle 6: 2-6-8-2
        - Cycle 7: 5-7-1-3-5
        - Cycle 8: 7-1-4-8-7
        - Cycle 9: 4-8-6-7-4
        - Cycle 10: 6-7-5-3-6
        - Cycle 11: 5-0-4-1-5
        - Cycle 12: 6-8-4-0-6
        - Cycle 13: 7-9-3-1-7
        - Cycle 14: 0-3-9-8-0
        - Cycle 15: 9-8-4-0-9
        - Cycle 16: 8-9-7-5-8
        - Cycle 17: 3-0-5-7-3
        - Cycle 18: 0-5-6-2-0
        - Cycle 19: 6-2-8-4-6

Step 2:
        Among these cycles, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
        <6, (8, 4), 0>

Step 3:
        Based on the above information, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
        The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <6, (8, 4), 0>.
