Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 13) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 7) (4, 9) (4, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 19) (7, 18) (7, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 6) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 14) (16, 12) (3, 5) (3, 12) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 11) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 0) (15, 13) (15, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 3 - 12 - 16
- Cycle 2: 5 - 11 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 3: 5 - 11 - 6 - 17
- Cycle 4: 5 - 10 - 9 - 14
- Cycle 5: 9 - 19 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 6: 9 - 14 - 17 - 6
- Cycle 7: 14 - 16 - 12 - 3
- Cycle 8: 14 - 17 - 19 - 0
- Cycle 9: 17 - 6 - 13 - 8
- Cycle 10: 17 - 19 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 11: 19 - 0 - 7 - 18
- Cycle 12: 19 - 14 - 16 - 12

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (3, 12)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (11, 9)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (11, 6)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (10, 14)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (19, 0)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (17, 6)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (14, 16)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (14, 19)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (6, 13)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (19, 9)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (14, 16)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <5, 3, 12, 16>
- <5, 11, 4, 9>
- <5, 11, 6, 17>
- <5, 10, 9, 14>
- <9, 19, 0, 1>
- <9, 14, 17, 6>
- <14, 16, 12, 3>
- <14, 17, 19, 0>
- <17, 6, 13, 8>
- <17, 19, 9, 4>
- <19, 0, 7, 18>
- <19, 14, 16, 12>
