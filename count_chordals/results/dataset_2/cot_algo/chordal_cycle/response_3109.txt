Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle <4, 7, 14, 6>
- Cycle <4, 12, 13, 11>
- Cycle <4, 0, 9, 12>
- Cycle <7, 5, 12, 9>
- Cycle <7, 2, 3, 5>
- Cycle <7, 9, 12, 13>
- Cycle <5, 2, 8, 6>
- Cycle <6, 8, 11, 14>
- Cycle <10, 1, 11, 13>
- Cycle <0, 10, 6, 8>
- Cycle <14, 1, 10, 0>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <4, 7, (14, 6)>
- <4, 12, (13, 11)>
- <4, 0, (9, 12)>
- <7, 5, (12, 9)>
- <7, 2, (3, 5)>
- <7, 9, (12, 13)>
- <5, 2, (8, 6)>
- <6, 8, (11, 14)>
- <10, 1, (11, 13)>
- <0, 10, (6, 8)>
- <14, 1, (10, 0)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 0 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [0].
