Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 3, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 2, 0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 8, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 7, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 7, 3, 4, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 1 has exactly one chord, which is (3, 4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the answer is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, (3, 4), 5>
