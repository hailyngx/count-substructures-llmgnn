Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 6, 9, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 9, 7, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 3, 4, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 6, 9, 4, 3)
- Cycle 6: (8, 3, 6, 1, 8)
- Cycle 7: (8, 3, 4, 9, 8)
- Cycle 8: (7, 9, 4, 3, 7)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the cycle 1 <5, 6, 1, 2, 5> has exactly one chord - edge (1, 6).
So, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <5, 6, 1, 2, 5>.

Step 3:
The total number of chordless cycles found is [7].
