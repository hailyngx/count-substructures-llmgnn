Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 7 - 9 - 2 - 0
        Cycle 2: 0 - 2 - 1 - 6 - 0
        Cycle 3: 1 - 6 - 8 - 2 - 1
        Cycle 4: 1 - 2 - 9 - 4 - 1
        Cycle 5: 1 - 2 - 8 - 6 - 1
        Cycle 6: 2 - 6 - 8 - 3 - 2
        Cycle 7: 3 - 1 - 6 - 8 - 3
        Cycle 8: 3 - 4 - 9 - 2 - 3
        Cycle 9: 3 - 7 - 8 - 4 - 3
        Cycle 10: 4 - 3 - 8 - 6 - 4
        Cycle 11: 5 - 0 - 3 - 4 - 5
        Cycle 12: 5 - 4 - 9 - 7 - 5
        Cycle 13: 7 - 9 - 2 - 8 - 7

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: <0, (7, 9), 0>
        - Cycle 2: <0, (1, 6), 0>
        - Cycle 3: <1, (8, 2), 1>
        - Cycle 4: <1, (9, 4), 1>
        - Cycle 5: <1, (2, 8), 1>
        - Cycle 6: <2, (6, 8), 2>
        - Cycle 7: <3, (1, 8), 3>
        - Cycle 8: <3, (4, 9), 3>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        - Total number of chordless 4-cycles: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <0, (7, 9), 0>
        <0, (1, 6), 0>
        <1, (8, 2), 1>
        <1, (9, 4), 1>
        <2, (6, 8), 2>
