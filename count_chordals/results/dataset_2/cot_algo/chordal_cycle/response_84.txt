Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 8) (4, 23) (4, 28) (4, 21) (7, 24) (21, 4) (21, 25) (21, 2) (1, 13) (1, 19) (3, 13) (3, 18) (18, 22) (18, 3) (18, 5) (18, 24) (8, 22) (8, 23) (8, 9) (23, 4) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 6) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 11) (12, 10) (27, 20) (27, 11) (6, 23) (6, 29) (6, 25) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 20) (28, 16) (19, 1) (19, 26) (19, 29) (26, 0) (26, 19) (26, 17) (16, 28) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 25) (15, 23) (15, 10) (15, 2) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 2) (11, 0) (11, 20) (11, 27) (11, 14) (14, 13) (14, 11) (17, 26) (17, 24) (29, 6) (29, 19) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 10) (24, 7) (24, 18) (24, 0) (24, 9) (24, 17) (5, 18) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 13 - 1 - 19 - 26 - 0 - 20 - 28 - 22 - 13
- Cycle 2: 13 - 1 - 19 - 26 - 17 - 24 - 18 - 3 - 13
- Cycle 3: 22 - 18 - 24 - 17 - 26 - 19 - 1 - 13 - 22
(Note: These are three of the many cycles present in the graph)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <13, 1, (19, 26), 0>
- <13, 1, (19, 26), 17>
- <22, 18, (24, 17), 26>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are [3] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
