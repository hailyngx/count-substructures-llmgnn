Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:

- Cycle 5: (9, 8, 5, 7, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 3, 5, 7, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 0, 8, 5, 9)
- Cycle 8: (6, 7, 0, 8, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 4, 3, 5, 6)
- Cycle 10: (1, 3, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 8, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 12: (3, 5, 7, 0, 3)
- Cycle 13: (3, 9, 8, 1, 3)
- Cycle 14: (3, 1, 2, 7, 3)
- Cycle 15: (3, 7, 0, 8, 3)
- Cycle 16: (3, 4, 8, 1, 3)
- Cycle 17: (4, 6, 7, 0, 4)
- Cycle 18: (4, 3, 1, 2, 4)
- Cycle 19: (4, 8, 5, 7, 4)
- Cycle 20: (8, 5, 7, 0, 8)
- Cycle 21: (8, 9, 3, 1, 8)
- Cycle 22: (8, 1, 2, 7, 8)
- Cycle 23: (8, 4, 3, 5, 8)
- Cycle 24: (0, 9, 8, 5, 0)
- Cycle 25: (0, 8, 5, 7, 0)
- Cycle 26: (0, 7, 5, 2, 0)
- Cycle 27: (0, 2, 1, 8, 0)
- Cycle 28: (7, 5, 3, 1, 7)
- Cycle 29: (7, 6, 4, 3, 7)
- Cycle 30: (7, 3, 1, 2, 7)
- Cycle 31: (7, 0, 8, 5, 7)
- Cycle 32: (7, 2, 5, 9, 7)
- Cycle 33: (2, 5, 3, 1, 2)
- Cycle 34: (2, 1, 8, 5, 2)
- Cycle 35: (2, 0, 7, 5, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, (9, 8), 5>
- <5, (3, 1), 8, 5>
- <5, (7, 0), 8, 5>
- <5, (2, 1), 8, 5>
- <9, (8, 5), 9>
- <9, (3, 5), 9>
- <9, (0, 8), 5, 9>
- <6, (7, 0), 8, 6>
- <6, (4, 3), 5, 6>
- <1, (3, 5), 2, 1>
- <1, (8, 5), 2, 1>
- <7, (0, 8), 5, 7>
- <4, (6, 7), 0, 4>
- <4, (3, 1), 2, 4>
- <8, (5, 7), 0, 8>
- <8, (9, 3), 1, 8>
- <8, (1, 2), 7, 8>
- <0, (9, 8), 5, 0>
- <0, (8, 5), 7, 0>
- <2, (5, 3), 1, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [19]
