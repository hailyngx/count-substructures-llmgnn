Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. (1, 4, 8, 13)
2. (1, 4, 2, 11)
3. (1, 8, 14, 5)
4. (1, 3, 0, 8)
5. (3, 0, 9, 2)
6. (3, 0, 8, 14)
7. (8, 4, 1, 11)
8. (8, 4, 2, 12)
9. (8, 4, 6, 10)
10. (8, 0, 9, 12)
11. (13, 8, 0, 3)
12. (13, 8, 4, 6)
13. (13, 8, 14, 5)
14. (13, 3, 0, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Cycle (1, 4, 8, 13) has chord (8, 4)
2. Cycle (1, 4, 2, 11) has no chord
3. Cycle (1, 8, 14, 5) has chord (8, 14)
4. Cycle (1, 3, 0, 8) has no chord
5. Cycle (3, 0, 9, 2) has no chord
6. Cycle (3, 0, 8, 14) has no chord
7. Cycle (8, 4, 1, 11) has no chord
8. Cycle (8, 4, 2, 12) has no chord
9. Cycle (8, 4, 6, 10) has no chord
10. Cycle (8, 0, 9, 12) has no chord
11. Cycle (13, 8, 0, 3) has no chord
12. Cycle (13, 8, 4, 6) has no chord
13. Cycle (13, 8, 14, 5) has no chord
14. Cycle (13, 3, 0, 9) has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There is only one chordal 4-cycle in the given graph, which is <1, 4, 8, 13> with the chord (8, 4).

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
