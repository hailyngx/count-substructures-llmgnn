Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-5-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-6-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-6-3-0
- Cycle 4: 0-7-2-5-0
- Cycle 5: 0-7-2-1-0
- Cycle 6: 0-7-8-5-0
- Cycle 7: 0-7-8-5-2-0
- Cycle 8: 0-7-9-1-0
- Cycle 9: 0-7-9-3-0
- Cycle 10: 0-3-6-4-0
- Cycle 11: 0-3-6-5-0
- Cycle 12: 0-3-9-1-0
- Cycle 13: 0-3-9-7-0
- Cycle 14: 1-6-3-9-1
- Cycle 15: 1-6-5-2-1
- Cycle 16: 2-7-8-5-2
- Cycle 17: 2-7-9-1-2
- Cycle 18: 3-6-4-5-3
- Cycle 19: 3-6-5-2-3

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, (4, 5), 2> (Chord: 4-5)
- <0, (4, 6), 1> (Chord: 4-6)
- <0, (4, 6), 3> (Chord: 4-6)
- <0, (7, 2), 5> (Chord: 7-2)
- <0, (7, 2), 1> (Chord: 7-2)
- <0, (7, 8), 5> (Chord: 7-8)
- <0, (7, 8), (5, 2)> (Chords: 7-8, 5-2)
- <0, (7, 9), 1> (Chord: 7-9)
- <0, (7, 9), 3> (Chord: 7-9)
- <0, (3, 6), 4> (Chord: 3-6)
- <0, (3, 6), 5> (Chord: 3-6)
- <0, (3, 9), 1> (Chord: 3-9)
- <0, (3, 9), 7> (Chord: 3-9)
- <1, (6, 3), 9> (Chord: 6-3)
- <1, (6, 5), 2> (Chord: 6-5)
- <2, (7, 8), 5> (Chord: 7-8)
- <2, (7, 9), 1> (Chord: 7-9)
- <3, (6, 4), 5> (Chord: 6-4)
- <3, (6, 5), 2> (Chord: 6-5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found, we have [18].
