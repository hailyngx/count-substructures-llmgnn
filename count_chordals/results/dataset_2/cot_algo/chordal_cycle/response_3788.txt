Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 17) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 17) (5, 19) (5, 17) (13, 18) (13, 9) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 9) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 14) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 9) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 5) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 4) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 3, 8, 11, 2, 18, 13, 9, 19, 5) - 1 chord
- (1, 3, 8, 11, 4, 6, 2, 18, 13, 9) - 1 chord
- (1, 14, 7, 12, 6, 2, 18, 13, 9, 19) - 1 chord
- (1, 14, 7, 12, 10, 16, 6, 2, 18, 13) - 1 chord
- (1, 14, 15, 16, 10, 12, 7, 10, 18, 13) - 1 chord
- (3, 8, 11, 4, 6, 12, 7, 14, 15, 16) - 1 chord
- (5, 19, 9, 13, 18, 2, 6, 12, 7, 14) - 1 chord
- (5, 17, 0, 15, 14, 7, 12, 6, 2, 11) - 1 chord
- (9, 13, 18, 10, 7, 12, 6, 4, 11, 8) - 1 chord

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 3, 8, 11, 2, 18, 13, 9> with one chord (1 chord)
- <1, 14, 7, 12, 6, 2, 18, 13> with one chord (1 chord)
- <3, 8, 11, 4, 6, 12, 7, 14> with one chord (1 chord)
- <5, 19, 9, 13, 18, 2, 6, 12> with one chord (1 chord)
- <5, 17, 0, 15, 14, 7, 12, 6> with one chord (1 chord)
- <9, 13, 18, 10, 7, 12, 6, 4> with one chord (1 chord)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The total number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [6].
