Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle <5, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle <5, 3, 7, 4>
- Cycle <9, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle <9, 3, 7, 4>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <5, 3, 1, 4> has a chord (3, 1) as (3, 4) and (1, 4) are adjacent
- <5, 3, 7, 4> has a chord (5, 7) as (5, 4) and (3, 7) are adjacent
- <9, 3, 1, 4> has a chord (9, 1) as (9, 4) and (3, 1) are adjacent
- <9, 3, 7, 4> has a chord (9, 7) as (9, 4) and (3, 7) are adjacent

Step 3:
There are no chordless cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
