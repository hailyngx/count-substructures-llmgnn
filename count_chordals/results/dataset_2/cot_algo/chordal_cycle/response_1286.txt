Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 19) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 17) (29, 11) (29, 13) (29, 5) (7, 21) (7, 18) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 3) (21, 18) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 4) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 21) (18, 4) (28, 11) (28, 5) (28, 23) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 4) (3, 20) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 5) (20, 3) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 27) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 0) (5, 29) (5, 28) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 22) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 14) (0, 15) (0, 25) (10, 2) (10, 21) (10, 13) (10, 23) (14, 19) (26, 11) (26, 25) (25, 0) (25, 26) (27, 20) (27, 24) (27, 9) (6, 23) (12, 24) (12, 22) (12, 9) (23, 28) (23, 10) (23, 6) (23, 9) (9, 27) (9, 12) (9, 23) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 12) (24, 27) (24, 12) (13, 29) (13, 20) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 22, 19, 5, 29, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 16, 22, 12, 24, 27, 9, 23, 28, 5, 19, 16, 11)
- Cycle 3: (2, 18, 4, 3, 21, 7, 8, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 17, 5, 19, 14, 26, 25, 0, 15, 1, 17, 2)
- Cycle 5: (20, 13, 10, 21, 7, 18, 4, 8, 7, 21, 3, 20)
- Cycle 6: (10, 13, 29, 11, 3, 4, 8, 7, 21, 10)
- Cycle 7: (23, 6, 10, 13, 29, 5, 28, 23)
- Cycle 8: (9, 27, 24, 12, 22, 16, 11, 3, 4, 18, 7, 21, 10, 13, 20, 17, 5, 19, 22, 12, 9)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 17> (Cycle 4)
- <20, 13> (Cycle 5)
- <29, 13> (Cycle 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [3] chordal 4-cycles found.
