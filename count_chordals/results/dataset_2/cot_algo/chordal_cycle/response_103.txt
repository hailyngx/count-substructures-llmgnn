Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 4, 8, 7, 9)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 3, 6, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 6, 1, 0, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (7, 5)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (8, 4)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (6, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph, so the final number is [0].
