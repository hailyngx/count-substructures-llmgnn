Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 0-2-8-4-0
- Cycle 2: 1-5-4-9-1
- Cycle 3: 3-0-4-9-3
- Cycle 4: 3-7-8-2-3
- Cycle 5: 4-5-2-8-4
- Cycle 6: 5-7-8-2-5

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- For Cycle 1: Chord is (0, 8)
- For Cycle 2: Chord is (1, 4)
- For Cycle 3: Chord is (3, 4)
- For Cycle 4: Chord is (3, 8)
- For Cycle 5: Chord is (5, 2)
- For Cycle 6: Chord is (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found = 6
Therefore, the final answer is [6].

Unique Chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 2, 8, 4> with chord (0, 8)
<1, 5, 4, 9> with chord (1, 4)
<3, 0, 4, 9> with chord (3, 4)
<3, 7, 8, 2> with chord (3, 8)
<4, 5, 2, 8> with chord (5, 2)
<5, 7, 8, 2> with chord (5, 8)
