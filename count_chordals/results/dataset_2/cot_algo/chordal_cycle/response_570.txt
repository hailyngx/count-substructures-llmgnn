Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 1) (11, 5) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 12) (10, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <8, 13, 5, 7, 8>
- Cycle 2: <8, 13, 3, 2, 8>
- Cycle 3: <8, 4, 9, 1, 8>
- Cycle 4: <8, 4, 6, 0, 8>
- Cycle 5: <13, 3, 14, 12, 13>
- Cycle 6: <13, 5, 11, 1, 13>
- Cycle 7: <4, 9, 10, 12, 4>
- Cycle 8: <4, 6, 1, 11, 4>
- Cycle 9: <3, 14, 12, 10, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 2, 1, 6, 3>
- Cycle 11: <11, 1, 9, 10, 11>
- Cycle 12: <5, 11, 1, 9, 5>
- Cycle 13: <1, 9, 10, 12, 1>
- Cycle 14: <6, 1, 9, 10, 6>
- Cycle 15: <0, 6, 1, 9, 0>
- Cycle 16: <0, 8, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle 17: <2, 7, 1, 6, 2>
- Cycle 18: <12, 10, 9, 1, 12>
- Cycle 19: <14, 8, 0, 12, 14>
- Cycle 20: <14, 3, 5, 7, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <8, 13, 5, 7, 8> has a chord {(13, 7)}
- The cycle <8, 13, 3, 2, 8> has a chord {(13, 2)}
- The cycle <4, 6, 1, 11, 4> has a chord {(6, 11)}
- The cycle <3, 14, 12, 10, 3> has a chord {(14, 10)}
- The cycle <0, 8, 7, 2, 0> has a chord {(8, 2)}

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 15 chordless cycles found, so the final answer is [15]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<8, 13, 5, 7> with chord (13, 7)
<8, 13, 3, 2> with chord (13, 2)
<4, 6, 1, 11> with chord (6, 11)
<3, 14, 12, 10> with chord (14, 10)
<0, 8, 7, 2> with chord (8, 2)
