Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle <0, 1, 8, 5, 6>
2. Cycle <0, 6, 2, 8, 1>
3. Cycle <0, 8, 3, 7, 1>
4. Cycle <0, 9, 4, 7, 1>
5. Cycle <1, 7, 9, 0, 6>
6. Cycle <1, 8, 2, 6, 5>
7. Cycle <3, 7, 9, 4, 6>
8. Cycle <3, 8, 2, 6, 0>
9. Cycle <4, 7, 9, 5, 6>
10. Cycle <5, 6, 4, 9, 0>
11. Cycle <5, 8, 1, 7, 9>
12. Cycle <6, 5, 9, 0, 8>
13. Cycle <6, 2, 8, 3, 7>
14. Cycle <7, 4, 9, 5, 6>
15. Cycle <8, 3, 7, 1, 6>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <0, 1, 8, (5, 6)>
2. <0, 6, 2, (8, 1)>
3. <0, 8, 3, (7, 1)>
4. <0, 9, 4, (7, 1)>
5. <1, 7, 9, (0, 6)>
6. <1, 8, 2, (6, 5)>
7. <3, 7, 9, (4, 6)>
8. <3, 8, 2, (6, 0)>
9. <4, 7, 9, (5, 6)>
10. <5, 6, 4, (9, 0)>
11. <5, 8, 1, (7, 9)>
12. <6, 5, 9, (0, 8)>
13. <6, 2, 8, (3, 7)>
14. <7, 4, 9, (5, 6)>
15. <8, 3, 7, (1, 6)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [15]
