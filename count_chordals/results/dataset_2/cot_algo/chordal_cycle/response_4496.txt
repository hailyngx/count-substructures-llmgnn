Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 1 - 3 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 0 - 1 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 4 - 3 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 7 - 3 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 2 - 1 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 6: 6 - 3 - 1 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 7: 6 - 8 - 2 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 8: 7 - 0 - 5 - 7
- Cycle 9: 7 - 3 - 1 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 10: 7 - 8 - 2 - 9 - 7

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (3, 6), 5>
- Cycle 2: <1, (0, 3), 5>
- Cycle 3: <1, (4, 3), 5>
- Cycle 4: <3, (4, 5), 7>
- Cycle 5: <8, (1, 9), 2>
- Cycle 6: <1, (3, 8), 6>
- Cycle 7: <2, (8, 9), 6>
- Cycle 8: <5, (0, 7), 3>
- Cycle 9: <7, (1, 8), 3>
- Cycle 10: <7, (2, 9), 8>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
- There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [10].
