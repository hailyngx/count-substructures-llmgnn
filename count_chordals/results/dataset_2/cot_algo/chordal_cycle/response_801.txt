Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 17) (27, 23) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 9) (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 19) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 16) (25, 8) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 21) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 24) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 21) (28, 11) (28, 3) (28, 12) (24, 17) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 4) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 3) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 8) (22, 9) (22, 1) (1, 29) (1, 22) (1, 23) (1, 19) (8, 25) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 0) (13, 3) (4, 24) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (19, 29) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 21) (16, 20) (16, 25) (21, 14) (21, 11) (21, 19) (12, 28) (12, 5) (12, 18) (3, 28) (3, 26) (3, 13) (6, 29) (6, 24) (6, 8) (6, 7) (7, 29) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (18, 20) (18, 14) (18, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (23, 27) (23, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle <0, 9, 15, 26, 24> 
2. Cycle <1, 29, 6, 24, 26>
3. Cycle <5, 0, 9, 22, 1>
4. Cycle <7, 29, 6, 24, 17>
5. Cycle <8, 25, 20, 16, 25>
6. Cycle <10, 5, 0, 9, 15>
7. Cycle <11, 7, 29, 1, 22>
8. Cycle <12, 5, 0, 13, 3>
9. Cycle <14, 17, 24, 4, 18>
10. Cycle <17, 14, 18, 12, 28>
11. Cycle <19, 1, 29, 19, 5>
12. Cycle <21, 19, 5, 12, 18>
13. Cycle <24, 17, 15, 26, 3>
14. Cycle <25, 20, 18, 14, 17>
15. Cycle <28, 11, 7, 5, 0>
16. Cycle <29, 6, 8, 9, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle <0, 9, 15, 26, 24> has chord (15, 24)
- Cycle <1, 29, 6, 24, 26> has chord (29, 24)
- Cycle <5, 0, 9, 22, 1> has chord (0, 1)
- Cycle <7, 29, 6, 24, 17> has chord (29, 17)
- Cycle <8, 25, 20, 16, 25> has chord (25, 20)
- Cycle <10, 5, 0, 9, 15> has chord (5, 15)
- Cycle <11, 7, 29, 1, 22> has chord (7, 1)
- Cycle <12, 5, 0, 13, 3> has chord (5, 13)
- Cycle <17, 14, 18, 12, 28> has chord (14, 12)
- Cycle <19, 1, 29, 19, 5> has chord (1, 5)
- Cycle <21, 19, 5, 12, 18> has chord (19, 12)
- Cycle <24, 17, 15, 26, 3> has chord (17, 26)
- Cycle <25, 20, 18, 14, 17> has chord (20, 17)
- Cycle <28, 11, 7, 5, 0> has chord (11, 5)
- Cycle <29, 6, 8, 9, 0> has chord (6, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [16].
