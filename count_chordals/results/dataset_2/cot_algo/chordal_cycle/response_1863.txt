Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-2-4-5
- Cycle 2: 1-2-8-7
- Cycle 3: 1-2-0-3
- Cycle 4: 1-2-6-8
- Cycle 5: 1-0-3-5
- Cycle 6: 1-9-4-5
- Cycle 7: 1-9-8-7
- Cycle 8: 1-9-0-3
- Cycle 9: 1-9-7-8
- Cycle 10: 2-4-9-7
- Cycle 11: 2-4-5-0
- Cycle 12: 2-4-9-1
- Cycle 13: 2-4-5-7
- Cycle 14: 2-4-9-8
- Cycle 15: 2-8-7-7
- Cycle 16: 2-8-6-1
- Cycle 17: 2-8-7-9
- Cycle 18: 2-0-3-5
- Cycle 19: 2-0-3-1
- Cycle 20: 2-6-8-7
- Cycle 21: 2-6-8-1
- Cycle 22: 2-6-7-7
- Cycle 23: 0-3-5-7
- Cycle 24: 0-3-5-4
- Cycle 25: 0-3-9-1
- Cycle 26: 0-5-4-9
- Cycle 27: 0-5-7-8
- Cycle 28: 3-5-4-9
- Cycle 29: 3-9-4-5
- Cycle 30: 8-7-9-1
- Cycle 31: 8-7-6-2
- Cycle 32: 8-7-9-0
- Cycle 33: 8-6-2-0
- Cycle 34: 8-6-7-5

Step 2:
Among these cycles, only one is a chordal 4-cycle:
- <1-9-4-5, (1, 5)>

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, which is <1-9-4-5, (1, 5)>.
Therefore, the final count inside brackets is [1].
