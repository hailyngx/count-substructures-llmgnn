Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (4, 8) (4, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 17) (9, 0) (9, 19) (9, 1) (9, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (18, 10) (18, 9) (18, 6) (6, 16) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 18) (14, 5) (14, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 11 - 16 - 6 - 0 - 11
        - Cycle 2: 13 - 10 - 7 - 5 - 13
        - Cycle 3: 13 - 10 - 18 - 9 - 13
        - Cycle 4: 13 - 17 - 15 - 13
        - Cycle 5: 8 - 12 - 19 - 9 - 8
        - Cycle 6: 4 - 1 - 14 - 5 - 4
        - Cycle 7: 2 - 3 - 16 - 6 - 2
        - Cycle 8: 19 - 6 - 0 - 9 - 19

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1 has one chord: (16, 6)
        - Cycle 2 has one chord: (10, 5)
        - Cycle 3 has one chord: (10, 9)
        - Cycle 4 has one chord: (17, 15)
        - Cycle 5 has one chord: (12, 9)
        - Cycle 6 has one chord: (1, 14)
        - Cycle 7 has one chord: (3, 16)
        - Cycle 8 has one chord: (0, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
        <1, (16, 6), 5)>
        <2, (10, 5), 3)>
        <3, (10, 9), 18)>
        <4, (17, 15), 13)>
        <5, (12, 9), 8)>
        <6, (1, 14), 4)>
        <7, (3, 16), 2)>
        <8, (0, 9), 19)>
