Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 5) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-3-0-10-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-2-12-1
- Cycle 3: 1-12-6-14-1
- Cycle 4: 1-7-0-13-1
- Cycle 5: 3-0-13-9-3
- Cycle 6: 3-2-5-14-3
- Cycle 7: 10-0-13-9-10
- Cycle 8: 12-6-14-9-12
- Cycle 9: 12-7-0-13-12
- Cycle 10: 5-14-6-12-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (3, 10), 0, 12, 1>
- <1, (3, 12), 2, 1>
- <1, (12, 6), 14, 1>
- <1, (7, 13), 0, 1>
- <3, (0, 13), 9, 3>
- <3, (2, 14), 5, 3>
- <10, (0, 13), 9, 10>
- <12, (6, 14), 9, 12>
- <12, (7, 13), 0, 12>
- <5, (14, 6), 12, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are: <1, (3, 10), 0, 12, 1>, <1, (3, 12), 2, 1>, <1, (12, 6), 14, 1>, <1, (7, 13), 0, 1>, <3, (0, 13), 9, 3>.
