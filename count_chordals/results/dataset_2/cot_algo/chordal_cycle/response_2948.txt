Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (5, 0) (9, 15) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (1, 11) (1, 3) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 8) (18, 4) (18, 10) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 17) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 19) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 15) (6, 0) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 17) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 15) (13, 4) (13, 3)

<0, 6, 17, 10, 18>
<0, 17, 12, 7, 4>
<0, 17, 10, 18, 4>
<0, 17, 12, 7, 4>
<1, 3, 4, 18, 10>
<1, 3, 4, 13, 19>
<1, 11, 16, 2, 17>
<1, 11, 16, 19, 14>
<2, 10, 18, 4, 13>
<2, 10, 17, 12, 8>
<2, 16, 19, 14, 4>
<2, 16, 11, 14, 19>
<3, 1, 11, 16, 19>
<3, 4, 18, 10, 17>
<3, 4, 13, 19, 15>
<3, 13, 4, 18, 10>
<4, 7, 12, 17, 10>
<4, 7, 12, 8, 15>
<4, 13, 19, 15, 8>
<5, 0, 17, 10, 18>
<7, 12, 17, 10, 18>
<9, 15, 19, 14, 11>
<10, 8, 15, 9, 19>
<10, 17, 12, 8, 15>
<11, 16, 2, 10, 17>
<11, 16, 19, 14, 4>
<13, 19, 15, 8, 12>
<14, 19, 15, 8, 10>
<15, 9, 19, 14, 11>
<16, 2, 10, 18, 4>
<17, 10, 18, 4, 13>
<19, 15, 8, 12, 7>

Step 2: Checking for one chord in each cycle:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, (14, 16), 19>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
As we found 1 chordal 4-cycle, the number of chordless cycles is [34].
