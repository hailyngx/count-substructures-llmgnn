Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 9) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 17) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (0, 14) (0, 19) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 10) (7, 14) (1, 17) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 6) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 16) (8, 15) (8, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (3, 6, 2, 14, 7, 14, 0, 19, 18, 16, 3)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 17, 1, 10, 8, 15, 12, 4, 16, 18, 19, 0)
- Cycle 3: (13, 3, 16, 4, 12, 15, 18, 19, 0, 14, 7, 14, 2)
- Cycle 4: (9, 13, 5, 9)
- Cycle 5: (11, 9, 5, 13, 10, 1, 17, 9)
- Cycle 6: (6, 3, 16, 4, 18, 15, 8, 10, 1, 17, 9, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <Cycle 1, (0, 7)>
- <Cycle 2, (9, 2)>
- <Cycle 3, (14, 12)>
- <Cycle 6, (3, 18)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
