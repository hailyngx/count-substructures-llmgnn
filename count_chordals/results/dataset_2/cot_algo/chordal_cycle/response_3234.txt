Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 0) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 11) (2, 29) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 27) (29, 0) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 24) (12, 8) (5, 21) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 11) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 8) (24, 13) (16, 28) (16, 15) (28, 2) (28, 16) (20, 29) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 23) (8, 12) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 15) (25, 27) (25, 15) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 25) (4, 22) (4, 0) (4, 15) (11, 26) (11, 22) (11, 1) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 1) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 25) (15, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 2) (3, 20) (3, 17) (3, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 23) (18, 23) (18, 0) (23, 20) (23, 17) (23, 18) (23, 21) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 18) (10, 1) (10, 3) (13, 7) (13, 24) (21, 5) (21, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle: (9, 26, 24, 12)
- Cycle: (9, 26, 11, 1)
- Cycle: (9, 26, 22, 4)
- Cycle: (9, 0, 29, 27)
- Cycle: (9, 0, 17, 23)
- Cycle: (26, 22, 4, 15)
- Cycle: (26, 24, 8, 20)
- Cycle: (26, 24, 12, 7)
- Cycle: (26, 11, 1, 14)
- Cycle: (2, 29, 27, 25)
- Cycle: (2, 29, 0, 17)
- Cycle: (2, 14, 1, 10)
- Cycle: (2, 3, 20, 8)
- Cycle: (29, 27, 25, 15)
- Cycle: (29, 20, 8, 24)
- Cycle: (7, 12, 24, 8)
- Cycle: (7, 13, 24, 12)
- Cycle: (12, 24, 8, 20)
- Cycle: (12, 24, 26, 11)
- Cycle: (5, 21, 23, 17)
- Cycle: (22, 26, 11, 1)
- Cycle: (22, 26, 24, 8)
- Cycle: (22, 4, 15, 25)
- Cycle: (24, 26, 11, 1)
- Cycle: (24, 12, 7, 13)
- Cycle: (24, 12, 24, 8)
- Cycle: (16, 28, 2, 29)
- Cycle: (16, 15, 25, 27)
- Cycle: (28, 2, 29, 0)
- Cycle: (28, 16, 15, 25)
- Cycle: (20, 29, 2, 14)
- Cycle: (20, 8, 14, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <(9, 26, 24, 12), (24, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <(9, 0, 29, 27), (29, 25)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <(2, 3, 20, 8), (3, 10)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <(7, 12, 24, 8), (12, 24)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <(5, 21, 23, 17), (21, 23)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <(20, 29, 2, 14), (29, 0)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the result is [5].
