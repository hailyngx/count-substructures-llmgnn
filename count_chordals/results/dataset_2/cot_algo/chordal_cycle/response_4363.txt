Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 12) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 13, 7, 11, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 13, 11, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 10, 11, 7, 4, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 10, 11, 7, 6, 2, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 10, 8, 7, 4, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 10, 8, 7, 6, 2, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 8, 7, 4, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 8, 7, 6, 2, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 8, 10, 11, 7, 4, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 8, 10, 11, 7, 6, 2, 5, 3, 1)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 3, 5, (2), 1>  (Chord: (2))
- <1, 3, 13, 7, (11), 1>  (Chord: (11))
- <1, 3, 13, (11), 1>  (Chord: (11))
- <1, 10, 11, 7, (4), 5, 3, 1>  (Chord: (4))
- <1, 10, 11, 7, (6), 2, 5, 3, 1>  (Chord: (6))
- <1, 10, 8, 7, (4), 5, 3, 1>  (Chord: (4))
- <1, 10, 8, 7, (6), 2, 5, 3, 1>  (Chord: (6))
- <1, 8, 7, (4), 5, 3, 1>  (Chord: (4))
- <1, 8, 7, (6), 2, 5, 3, 1>  (Chord: (6))
- <1, 8, 10, 11, 7, (4), 5, 3, 1>  (Chord: (4))
- <1, 8, 10, 11, 7, (6), 2, 5, 3, 1>  (Chord: (6))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
