Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (7, 12) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (17, 12) (17, 13) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 18) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 16) (11, 12) (11, 0) (3, 19) (3, 14) (14, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle: (5, 9, 1, 8, 2, 16, 0, 10) with edges: (5, 9), (9, 1), (1, 8), (8, 2), (2, 16), (16, 0), (0, 10), (10, 5)
- Cycle: (5, 9, 13, 17, 12, 11, 0, 6) with edges: (5, 9), (9, 13), (13, 17), (17, 12), (12, 11), (11, 0), (0, 6), (6, 5)
- Cycle: (5, 13, 15, 2, 8, 1, 9, 12) with edges: (5, 13), (13, 15), (15, 2), (2, 8), (8, 1), (1, 9), (9, 12), (12, 5)
- Cycle: (6, 0, 10, 12, 17, 13, 18, 16) with edges: (6, 0), (0, 10), (10, 12), (12, 17), (17, 13), (13, 18), (18, 16), (16, 6)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle: (5, 9, 1, 8, 2, 16, 0, 10) has chords: (9, 2)
- Cycle: (5, 9, 13, 17, 12, 11, 0, 6) has chords: (9, 12)
- Cycle: (5, 13, 15, 2, 8, 1, 9, 12) has chords: (13, 9)
- Cycle: (6, 0, 10, 12, 17, 13, 18, 16) has chords: (12, 16)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 0 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 9, 1, 8, (2), (16), 0, 10>
- <5, 9, 13, 17, 12, (11), 0, 6>
- <5, 13, 15, 2, 8, 1, 9, (12)>
- <6, 0, 10, 12, 17, 13, (18), 16>
