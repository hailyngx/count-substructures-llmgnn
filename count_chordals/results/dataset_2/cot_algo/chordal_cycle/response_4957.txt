Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 16) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 18) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 16) (1, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 4) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 14) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 19) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 18) (6, 17) (16, 9) (16, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 15, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (2, 5, 9, 15, 2)
- Cycle 3: (4, 3, 15, 9, 4)
- Cycle 4: (12, 2, 5, 14, 12)
- Cycle 5: (18, 11, 0, 12, 18)
- Cycle 6: (17, 13, 8, 15, 17)
- Cycle 7: (7, 10, 2, 5, 7)
- Cycle 8: (14, 18, 3, 4, 14)
- Cycle 9: (16, 9, 15, 3, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, (5, 9), 2> has exactly one chord (5, 9).
- <2, (2, 5), 12> has exactly one chord (2, 5).
- <3, (4, 3), 15> has exactly one chord (4, 3).
- <4, (12, 2), 14> has exactly one chord (12, 2).
- <5, (18, 11), 0> has exactly one chord (18, 11).
- <6, (17, 13), 8> has exactly one chord (17, 13).
- <7, (7, 10), 2> has exactly one chord (7, 10).
- <8, (14, 18), 3> has exactly one chord (14, 18).
- <9, (16, 9), 15> has exactly one chord (16, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the final count is [9].
