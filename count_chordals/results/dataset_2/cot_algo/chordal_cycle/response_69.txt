Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (17, 19) (17, 5) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 16) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 16) (18, 7) (18, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (11, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 5) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 15) (9, 1) (9, 13) (15, 12) (15, 14) (15, 16) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 19) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 18) (19, 17) (19, 14) (19, 16) (19, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (2, 8, 4, 16, 2)
- Cycle 2: (12, 1, 9, 13, 12)
- Cycle 3: (3, 12, 6, 18, 3)
- Cycle 4: (14, 15, 16, 19, 14)
- Cycle 5: (5, 4, 10, 3, 5)
- Cycle 6: (16, 15, 14, 5, 16)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (2, 4)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (15, 19)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<2, 8, 16, 4, (2, 4)>
<12, 1, 9, 13, (1, 9)>
<14, 15, 16, 19, (15, 19)>
