Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 5) (2, 7) (2, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (3, 13, 7, 4, 3)
- Cycle 2: (12, 8, 6, 4, 12)
- Cycle 3: (1, 0, 10, 6, 1)
- Cycle 4: (10, 9, 11, 3, 10)
- Cycle 5: (7, 1, 0, 11, 7)
- Cycle 6: (12, 14, 9, 11, 12)
- Cycle 7: (5, 12, 8, 13, 5)
- Cycle 8: (1, 4, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 9: (4, 7, 2, 13, 4)
- Cycle 10: (9, 6, 8, 13, 9)
- Cycle 11: (4, 5, 10, 3, 4)
- Cycle 12: (7, 5, 10, 6, 7)
- Cycle 13: (3, 12, 14, 9, 3)
- Cycle 14: (1, 8, 11, 0, 1)
- Cycle 15: (14, 12, 8, 6, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, (13, 7), 4>
- <12, (8, 6), 4>
- <1, (0, 10), 6>
- <10, (9, 11), 3>
- <7, (1, 0), 11>
- <12, (14, 9), 11>
- <5, (12, 8), 13>
- <1, (4, 7), 2>
- <4, (7, 2), 13>
- <9, (6, 8), 13>
- <4, (5, 10), 3>
- <7, (5, 10), 6>
- <3, (12, 14), 9>
- <1, (8, 11), 0>
- <14, (12, 8), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [15]
