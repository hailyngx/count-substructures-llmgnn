Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (27, 12) (27, 21) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 26) (6, 19) (9, 6) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 24) (22, 18) (22, 14) (22, 11) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 1) (25, 20) (25, 29) (25, 4) (5, 17) (5, 24) (8, 14) (23, 14) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 28) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 7) (7, 15) (7, 23) (7, 12) (4, 18) (4, 25) (4, 29) (4, 2) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 26) (1, 17) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 1) (26, 2) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 21) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 22) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 17) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 29) (16, 10) (28, 23) (28, 16) (28, 0) (0, 16) (0, 28) (10, 23) (10, 16) (2, 4) (2, 26) (2, 3) (2, 11) (13, 3) (21, 27) (21, 17) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 23) (14, 24) (19, 6) (19, 29) (29, 25) (29, 4) (29, 16) (29, 19) (24, 18) (24, 5) (24, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph including cycles of length 4 or more. We will list them here:
1. Cycle: 6 - 9 - 6 - 12 - 7
2. Cycle: 6 - 12 - 7 - 15 - 7
3. Cycle: 6 - 1 - 20 - 26 - 6
4. Cycle: 4 - 18 - 24 - 5 - 4
5. Cycle: 4 - 25 - 20 - 1 - 4
6. Cycle: 29 - 25 - 4 - 29
7. Cycle: 16 - 17 - 1 - 20 - 16
8. Cycle: 16 - 28 - 23 - 14 - 16

Step 2:
We will now check each cycle for exactly one chord:
2. Cycle: 6 - 12 - 7 - 15 - 7  <(6, 15)>
4. Cycle: 4 - 18 - 24 - 5 - 4  <(18, 5)>
6. Cycle: 29 - 25 - 4 - 29  <(25, 4)>
7. Cycle: 16 - 17 - 1 - 20 - 16  <(17, 20)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have [4].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <6, 12, 7, 15> with chord (6, 15)
2. <4, 18, 24, 5> with chord (18, 5)
3. <29, 25, 4, 29> with chord (25, 4)
4. <16, 17, 1, 20> with chord (17, 20)
