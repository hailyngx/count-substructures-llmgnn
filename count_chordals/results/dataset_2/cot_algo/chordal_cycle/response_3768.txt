Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 14) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (10, 8) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<5, 13, 3, 1>
<5, 13, 3, 8>
<9, 2, 6, 8>
<9, 2, 6, 1>
<6, 8, 3, 1>
<1, 3, 13, 5>
<3, 13, 5, 9>
<8, 6, 1, 3>
<8, 6, 1, 0>
<13, 5, 9, 7>
<13, 5, 9, 2>
<7, 9, 2, 6>
<7, 9, 2, 11>
<12, 3, 1, 6>
<12, 3, 1, 0>
<4, 6, 1, 3>
<4, 6, 1, 0>
<11, 5, 13, 3>
<11, 5, 13, 4>
<2, 9, 7, 14>
<2, 9, 7, 11>
<14, 7, 9, 2>
<14, 7, 9, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

The unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
<5, 13, 3, 1, (5, 9)>
<9, 2, 6, 8, (9, 7)>
<6, 8, 3, 1, (6, 2)>
<13, 5, 9, 7, (13, 8)>
<7, 9, 2, 6, (7, 11)>
<12, 3, 1, 6, (12, 14)>
<4, 6, 1, 3, (4, 13)>
<11, 5, 13, 3, (11, 7)>
<2, 9, 7, 14, (2, 0)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
