Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 4, 7>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 3, 4, 2>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 1, 4, 3>
- Cycle 5: <5, 3, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle 6: <5, 2, 4, 7, 9>
- Cycle 7: <9, 7, 3, 6, 8>
- Cycle 8: <4, 7, 9, 1, 2>
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 9, 8, 6>
- Cycle 10: <4, 2, 1, 9, 5>
- Cycle 11: <7, 9, 8, 6, 3>
- Cycle 12: <8, 6, 3, 5, 2>
- Cycle 13: <6, 8, 0, 2, 5>
- Cycle 14: <0, 8, 6, 3, 7>
- Cycle 15: <2, 4, 3, 6, 8>
- Cycle 16: <3, 7, 9, 1, 4>
- Cycle 17: <1, 9, 5, 2, 4>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 4> (Chord: (9, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 9, 1, 4> (Chord: (9, 1))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 9, 3, 4> (Chord: (9, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 9, 1, 4> (Chord: (9, 1))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 3, 7, 4> (Chord: (3, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, 2, 4, 7> (Chord: (2, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <9, 7, 3, 6> (Chord: (7, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, 7, 9, 1> (Chord: (7, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, 7, 9, 8> (Chord: (7, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <4, 2, 1, 9> (Chord: (2, 1))
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <7, 9, 8, 6> (Chord: (9, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <8, 6, 3, 5> (Chord: (6, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <6, 8, 0, 2> (Chord: (8, 2))
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <0, 8, 6, 3> (Chord: (8, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <2, 4, 3, 6> (Chord: (4, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <3, 7, 9, 1> (Chord: (7, 1))
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <1, 9, 5, 2> (Chord: (9, 5))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 17
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [17].
