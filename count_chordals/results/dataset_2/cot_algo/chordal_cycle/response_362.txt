Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-1-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-9-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-1-3-0
- Cycle 4: 0-4-8-7-0
- Cycle 5: 0-5-6-9-0
- Cycle 6: 0-5-7-8-0
- Cycle 7: 0-6-5-7-0
- Cycle 8: 0-7-8-4-0
- Cycle 9: 1-3-9-4-1
- Cycle 10: 2-1-4-8-2
- Cycle 11: 3-1-2-8-3
- Cycle 12: 3-9-6-5-3
- Cycle 13: 4-1-2-8-4
- Cycle 14: 4-6-5-7-4
- Cycle 15: 5-6-9-7-5
- Cycle 16: 7-8-2-1-7
- Cycle 17: 8-4-9-6-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <0, (4, 1), 3, 3>
- <0, (4, 9), 3, 3>
- <0, (4, 8), 7, 7>
- <0, (6, 5), 7, 7>
- <0, (8, 7), 4, 4>
- <1, (9, 4), 3, 3>
- <2, (1, 4), 8, 8>
- <3, (6, 5), 9, 9>
- <4, (5, 7), 6, 6>
- <5, (9, 6), 7, 7>
- <7, (1, 2), 8, 8>
- <8, (6, 9), 4, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles.
So, the final answer is [12].
