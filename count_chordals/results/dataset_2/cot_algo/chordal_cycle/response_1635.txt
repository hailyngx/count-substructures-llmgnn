Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. (5, 1, 0, 3, 5)
2. (3, 1, 5, 6, 3)
3. (4, 6, 5, 8, 4)
4. (2, 0, 1, 5, 2)
5. (8, 6, 9, 3, 8)
6. (7, 0, 1, 5, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the cycles listed above, only one cycle has exactly one chord:
- <3, (5, 4), 6> which represents the cycle (4, 6, 5, 8, 4) with the chord (5, 4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
