Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 1) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 0) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 11) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 19) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 10) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 13) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (19, 6) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 19) (9, 11) (9, 15) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 9) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
1. (1, 17, 2, 1)
2. (1, 2, 17, 1)
3. (1, 10, 5, 15, 1)
4. (1, 12, 8, 10, 1)
5. (2, 17, 1, 2)
6. (4, 14, 13, 0, 4)
7. (4, 13, 0, 18, 4)
8. (4, 18, 11, 8, 4)
9. (4, 11, 8, 12, 4)
10. (5, 15, 9, 11, 5)
11. (5, 10, 12, 1, 5)
12. (6, 15, 9, 11, 6)
13. (6, 10, 12, 1, 6)
14. (8, 12, 10, 5, 8)
15. (8, 11, 4, 13, 8)
16. (8, 10, 1, 12, 8)
17. (11, 18, 4, 13, 11)
18. (11, 9, 15, 6, 11)
19. (15, 5, 10, 6, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (2, 17), 1>
2. <1, (1, 12), 10>
3. <4, (13, 0), 18>
4. <4, (8, 11), 10>
5. <5, (9, 11), 15>
6. <6, (9, 15), 11>
7. <8, (4, 13), 11>
8. <8, (10, 1), 12>
9. <11, (4, 13), 18>
10. <15, (5, 10), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. Therefore, the count of chordless cycles is [10].
