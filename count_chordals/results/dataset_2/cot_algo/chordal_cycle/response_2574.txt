Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 3, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 2, 1, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 0, 9, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 3, 1, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 7, 4, 6, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 1, 3, 7, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 3, 1, 6, 9)
- Cycle 9: (4, 2, 1, 0, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 2, 6, 8, 4)
- Cycle 11: (7, 3, 9, 0, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 4, 2, 6, 7)
- Cycle 13: (1, 3, 7, 5, 1)
- Cycle 14: (1, 6, 4, 0, 1)
- Cycle 15: (3, 1, 9, 0, 3)
- Cycle 16: (3, 7, 5, 1, 3)
- Cycle 17: (6, 1, 9, 3, 6)
- Cycle 18: (6, 5, 7, 3, 6)
- Cycle 19: (6, 8, 2, 4, 6)
- Cycle 20: (2, 1, 9, 5, 2)
- Cycle 21: (2, 6, 4, 0, 2)
- Cycle 22: (0, 1, 3, 7, 0)
- Cycle 23: (0, 4, 2, 6, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (9, 1), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (9, 3), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (4, 2), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (4, 0), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (7, 3), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, (7, 4), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <9, (1, 3), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <3, (1, 9), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (2, 1), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <4, (2, 6), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <7, (3, 9), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <7, (4, 2), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <1, (3, 7), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <1, (6, 4), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <3, (1, 9), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <3, (7, 5), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <6, (1, 9), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <6, (5, 7), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <6, (8, 2), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <2, (1, 9), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 21: <2, (6, 4), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 22: <0, (1, 3), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 23: <0, (4, 2), 6>

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [23]
