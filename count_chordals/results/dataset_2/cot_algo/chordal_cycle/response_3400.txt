Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-1-9-4
- Cycle 2: 4-7-6-4
- Cycle 3: 4-9-2-8-4
- Cycle 4: 4-8-3-0-4
- Cycle 5: 4-6-7-5-4
- Cycle 6: 1-7-5-3-1
- Cycle 7: 3-0-8-2-3
- Cycle 8: 3-5-2-9-3

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <4, (9, 8), 2, 4> (Chord: 9-8)

Step 3:
Since there is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, (9, 8), 2, 4>.
