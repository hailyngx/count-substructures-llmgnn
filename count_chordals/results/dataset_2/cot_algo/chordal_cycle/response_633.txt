Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 3) (14, 13) (14, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 14, 13, 12, 2, 1, 10>
- Cycle 2: <5, 10, 13, 14, 3, 7, 0, 11>
- Cycle 3: <6, 9, 8, 13, 14, 3, 7, 4>
- Cycle 4: <7, 3, 14, 13, 10, 1, 4, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (12, 13)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (10, 5)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord (8, 7)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord (3, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 3, 14, 13, 12, 2, 1, 10> with chord (12, 13)
- <5, 10, 13, 14, 3, 7, 0, 11> with chord (10, 5)
- <6, 9, 8, 13, 14, 3, 7, 4> with chord (8, 7)
- <7, 3, 14, 13, 10, 1, 4, 7) with chord (3, 1)
