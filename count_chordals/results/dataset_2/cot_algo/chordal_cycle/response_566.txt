Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 29) (20, 6) (20, 5) (25, 27) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 24) (13, 27) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 20) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (3, 5) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 19) (28, 0) (28, 9) (28, 10) (28, 2) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 10) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 21) (9, 28) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 7) (18, 26) (18, 27) (21, 3) (21, 26) (21, 23) (21, 14) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 23) (29, 11) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 17) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 19) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 15) (16, 7) (11, 29) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 21) (14, 11) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 28) (23, 21) (23, 29) (23, 10) (19, 3) (19, 12) (19, 17) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 23) (15, 12) (15, 7) (27, 25) (27, 13) (27, 18) (24, 13) (24, 4) (24, 2) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 24) (17, 4) (17, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 10, 28, 2, 24, 13, 27, 18, 26, 21, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (10, 6, 5, 3, 21, 26, 22, 9, 29, 11, 2, 24, 4, 12, 13, 27, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the cycles above, we can identify the chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, 6, 10, 28> (Chord: (6, 28))
- <10, 6, 5, 3> (Chord: (6, 3))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
