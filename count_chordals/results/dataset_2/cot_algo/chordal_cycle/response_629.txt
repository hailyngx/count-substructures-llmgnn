Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 17) (1, 14) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 16) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 0) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 16) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 9) (9, 19) (9, 15) (9, 14) (16, 5) (16, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 3-8-7-12-13 
        - Cycle 2: 2-10-4-17
        - Cycle 3: 5-13-12-7
        - Cycle 4: 1-14-4-17
        - Cycle 5: 6-17-11-2
        - Cycle 6: 9-19-15-7

Step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord 7-13
        - Cycle 2 has a chord 4-10

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <3, (7,13), 12, 8>
        <2, (4,10), 17, 11>
