Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 8) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (6, 9, 2, 6)
        - Cycle 2: (6, 9, 4, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 3: (6, 9, 12, 0, 6)
        - Cycle 4: (6, 9, 12, 1, 13, 8, 6)
        - Cycle 5: (6, 9, 12, 1, 13, 11, 8, 6)
        - Cycle 6: (6, 9, 14, 7, 11, 8, 6)
        - Cycle 7: (6, 9, 14, 13, 1, 12, 8, 6)
        - Cycle 8: (7, 14, 13, 1, 12, 8, 11, 7)
        - Cycle 9: (7, 14, 13, 8, 11, 7)
        - Cycle 10: (6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 9, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Cycle 4: (6, 9, 12, 1, 13, 8, 6) <(9, 1)>
        - Cycle 5: (6, 9, 12, 1, 13, 11, 8, 6) <(9, 11)>
        - Cycle 6: (6, 9, 14, 7, 11, 8, 6) <(9, 7)>
        - Cycle 7: (6, 9, 14, 13, 1, 12, 8, 6) <(9, 13)>
        - Cycle 8: (7, 14, 13, 1, 12, 8, 11, 7) <(14, 1)>
        - Cycle 10: (6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 9, 6) <(8, 14)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        The unique chordal 4-cycle is <6, 8, 11, 13>.
        
        Therefore, the total number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
