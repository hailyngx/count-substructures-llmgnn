Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 6, 1, 9> with chord (5, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 9, 0, 7> with chord (9, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 9, 8, 2> with chord (9, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, 1, 6, 7> with chord (1, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, 4, 1, 6> with chord (4, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, 8, 1, 6> with chord (8, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <2, 5, 4, 9> with chord (5, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <2, 5, 7, 8> with chord (5, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <8, 9, 1, 4> with chord (9, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <7, 5, 4, 9> with chord (5, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- There are 60 cycles in total.
- There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
- Therefore, the final count of chordless cycles is [50].
