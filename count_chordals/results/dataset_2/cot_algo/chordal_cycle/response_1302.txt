Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 14) (16, 29) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 15) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 25) (12, 3) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 7) (27, 6) (4, 8) (4, 20) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 21) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 18) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 6) (20, 4) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 6) (18, 17) (18, 7) (22, 5) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 1) (13, 5) (13, 26) (26, 13) (26, 14) (1, 10) (1, 22) (1, 15) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 21) (23, 11) (23, 10) (29, 16) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 24) (14, 11) (14, 26) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 24) (24, 29) (24, 2) (28, 5) (28, 8) (6, 27) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 20) (6, 22) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 25) (3, 12) (3, 20) (3, 19) (25, 12) (25, 15) (25, 21) (7, 27) (7, 18) (19, 16) (19, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: 5-9-15-1-5
- Cycle 2: 10-23-11-14-26-13-5-9-10
- Cycle 3: 6-20-4-8-21-25-15-1-22-6
- Cycle 4: 27-12-2-24-29-16-19-3-20-6-17-18-7-27

Step 2:
Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord 1-15.
- Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord 2-24.

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<1, (15, 1)>
<2, (24, 2)>
