Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 0) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 8, 5, 4)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 2, 8, 6)
- Cycle 3: (10, 11, 0, 3, 10)
- Cycle 4: (14, 0, 9, 2, 14)
- Cycle 5: (12, 8, 7, 4, 12)
- Cycle 6: (1, 6, 9, 0, 1)
- Cycle 7: (5, 11, 13, 12, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (6, 9), 5> with chord (6, 9)
- <2, (9, 0), 8> with chord (9, 0)
- <3, (10, 11), 0> with chord (10, 11)
- <4, (0, 9), 14> with chord (0, 9)
- <5, (12, 7), 4> with chord (12, 7)
- <6, (1, 9), 6> with chord (1, 9)
- <7, (5, 12), 13> with chord (5, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
