Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-6-4-1
- Cycle 2: 2-1-3-2

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (2, 3)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<2, (2, 3)>
