Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 12) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 6) (2, 10) (2, 12) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 1, 10, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 4, 13, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 10, 3, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 11, 10, 2, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 11, 7, 0, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 11, 14, 7, 5)
- Cycle 8: (9, 4, 12, 8, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 1, 3, 10, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 10, 11, 5, 9)
- Cycle 11: (1, 3, 10, 9, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 0, 5, 7, 1)
- Cycle 13: (1, 10, 9, 13, 1)
- Cycle 14: (1, 8, 14, 7, 1)
- Cycle 15: (3, 13, 12, 4, 3)
- Cycle 16: (3, 10, 11, 7, 3)
- Cycle 17: (10, 11, 5, 0, 10)
- Cycle 18: (10, 2, 12, 8, 10)
- Cycle 19: (11, 0, 6, 0, 11)
- Cycle 20: (11, 14, 8, 12, 11)
- Cycle 21: (4, 12, 2, 10, 4)
- Cycle 22: (8, 12, 2, 10, 8)
- Cycle 23: (7, 12, 2, 10, 7)
- Cycle 24: (7, 14, 8, 12, 7)
- Cycle 25: (12, 4, 13, 7, 12)
- Cycle 26: (12, 8, 14, 7, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (9, 1), 10, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 9, (10, 3), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
