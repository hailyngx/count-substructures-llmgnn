Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The 4-cycles with exactly one chord are: <6, (9, 16), 13)>, <9, (16, 2), 13)>, <10, (5, 15), 8)>, <11, (15, 4), 12)>, <11, (15, 8), 3)>, <4, (12, 2), 13)>, <1, (7, 13), 2)>, <0, (19, 5), 15)>, <0, (12, 4), 5)>, <14, (6, 1), 19)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
