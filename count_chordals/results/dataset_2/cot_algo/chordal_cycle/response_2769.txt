Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1-6-5-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-5-8-0-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-5-4-9-2-7-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-3-9-4-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-3-9-7-1
- Cycle 6: 1-6-3-1
- Cycle 7: 1-3-9-4-1
- Cycle 8: 1-3-9-7-1
- Cycle 9: 1-3-6-5-4-1
- Cycle 10: 1-3-6-5-8-0-1
- Cycle 11: 1-3-6-5-4-9-2-7-1
- Cycle 12: 2-9-4-1-6-3-2
- Cycle 13: 2-9-4-1-6-5-8-0-2
- Cycle 14: 2-9-4-1-7-0-8-5-2
- Cycle 15: 2-9-4-1-7-0-6-5-2
- Cycle 16: 2-9-4-1-6-5-2
- Cycle 17: 2-9-3-6-5-8-0-2
- Cycle 18: 2-9-3-6-5-4-1-2
- Cycle 19: 2-9-3-6-1-4-5-2
- Cycle 20: 2-9-3-1-6-5-4-2
- Cycle 21: 2-9-3-1-4-5-8-0-2
- Cycle 22: 2-9-3-1-6-5-2
- Cycle 23: 2-7-0-8-5-6-1-2
- Cycle 24: 2-7-0-6-5-4-1-2
- Cycle 25: 2-7-0-6-5-8-2
- Cycle 26: 2-7-1-6-5-4-9-2
- Cycle 27: 2-7-1-6-3-9-4-2
- Cycle 28: 2-7-1-6-3-1-2
- Cycle 29: 2-7-1-3-9-4-2
- Cycle 30: 2-7-1-3-6-5-4-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (5, 4)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 14 has 1 chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 16 has 1 chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 17 has 1 chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 18 has 1 chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 20 has 1 chord: (3, 1)
- Cycle 21 has 1 chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 26 has 1 chord: (7, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 30 cycles found in total, out of which 14 cycles have exactly one chord. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles is 30 - 14 = 16.

Therefore, the final answer is [16].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, 5, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 3, 9>,  <1, 6, 5, 8>, <2, 9, 3, 1>, <2, 9, 4, 1>, <2, 7, 1, 6>.
