Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 18) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 5) (19, 13) (19, 2) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 5) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 5) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 16) (4, 6) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 19) (6, 11) (6, 4) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 9, 8, 7, 12, 17, 15, 0, 1)
- Cycle 2: (4, 16, 5, 12, 7, 8, 9, 3, 1, 16, 4)
- Cycle 3: (2, 19, 13, 4, 14, 3, 0, 18, 5, 15, 17, 12, 7, 8, 9, 4, 13, 19, 2)
- Cycle 4: (6, 4, 13, 19, 2, 10, 11, 17, 15, 5, 18, 0, 3, 14, 2, 19, 13, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <1, (3, 9), 8, 7, 12, 17, 15, 0> has exactly one chord: (3, 9)
- <4, 16, 5, 12, (7, 8), 9, 3, 1> has exactly one chord: (7, 8)
- <2, 19, 13, 4, (14, 3), 0, 18, 5, 15, 17, 12, 7> has exactly one chord: (14, 3)
- <6, 4, 13, 19, 2, 10, 11, 17, 15, 5, (18, 0), 3, 14> has exactly one chord: (18, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are [2] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
