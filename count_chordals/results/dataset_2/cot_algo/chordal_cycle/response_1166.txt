Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-1-4-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-4-8-6
- Cycle 3: 6-4-1-9-6
- Cycle 4: 9-1-3-7-9
- Cycle 5: 9-1-4-8-9
- Cycle 6: 9-4-8-7-9
- Cycle 7: 9-4-2-0-9
- Cycle 8: 1-3-7-5-1
- Cycle 9: 1-4-8-7-1
- Cycle 10: 3-7-5-0-3
- Cycle 11: 4-1-7-8-4
- Cycle 12: 4-8-7-5-4
- Cycle 13: 4-2-0-5-4
- Cycle 14: 8-7-5-0-8

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <6, (9, 1), 4, 8>
- <6, (9, 4), 8, 7>
- <6, (4, 1), 9, 6>
- <9, (1, 3), 7, 9>
- <9, (1, 4), 8, 9>
- <9, (4, 2), 0, 9>
- <1, (3, 7), 5, 1>
- <1, (4, 8), 7, 1>
- <3, (7, 5), 0, 3>
- <4, (1, 7), 8, 4>
- <4, (8, 7), 5, 4>
- <4, (2, 0), 5, 4>
- <8, (7, 5), 0, 8>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [13]
