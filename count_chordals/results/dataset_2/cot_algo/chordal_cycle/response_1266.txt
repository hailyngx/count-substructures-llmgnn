        - Cycle 30: (12, 18, 19, 18)
        - Cycle 31: (12, 18, 15, 0)
 
Step 2: Identify cycle with exactly one chord:
        - Chordal cycle 1: (5, 9, 29, 7) with chord (9, 7)
        - Chordal cycle 2: (5, 9, 19, 18) with chord (9, 18)
        - Chordal cycle 3: (5, 9, 19, 20) with chord (9, 20)
        - Chordal cycle 4: (9, 29, 7, 21) with chord (29, 21)
        - Chordal cycle 5: (7, 21, 2, 24) with chord (21, 24)
        - Chordal cycle 6: (12, 27, 22, 1) with chord (27, 1)
        - Chordal cycle 7: (12, 14, 26, 10) with chord (14, 10)
        - Chordal cycle 8: (12, 18, 15, 0) with chord (18, 0)
 
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are total [8] unique chordal 4-cycles. 
 
        The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        <5, 9, 29, 7> with chord (9, 7)
        <5, 9, 19, 18> with chord (9, 18)
        <5, 9, 19, 20> with chord (9, 20)
        <9, 29, 7, 21> with chord (29, 21)
        <7, 21, 2, 24> with chord (21, 24)
        <12, 27, 22, 1> with chord (27, 1)
        <12, 14, 26, 10> with chord (14, 10)
        <12, 18, 15, 0> with chord (18, 0)
