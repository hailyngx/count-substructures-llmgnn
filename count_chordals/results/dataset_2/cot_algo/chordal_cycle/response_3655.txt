Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-2-8-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-8-0-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-1-4-5
- Cycle 4: 5-4-1-2-5
- Cycle 5: 5-4-6-7-5
- Cycle 6: 5-7-0-8-5
- Cycle 7: 9-2-1-4-9
- Cycle 8: 9-8-0-7-9
- Cycle 9: 4-1-2-8-4
- Cycle 10: 2-9-8-0-2
- Cycle 11: 8-0-7-6-8
- Cycle 12: 0-8-3-4-0

Step 2:  
Checking for exactly one chord:
- <5, (9, 2), 8>
- <5, (8, 0), 9>
- <5, (1, 4), 9>
- <5, (1, 2), 4>
- <4, (1, 2), 8>
- <2, (8, 0), 9>
- <8, (0, 7), 9>
- <0, (8, 3), 4>

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]
