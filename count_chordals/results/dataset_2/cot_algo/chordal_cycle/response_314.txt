Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 10) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: 4-8-9-12-4
        - Cycle 2: 4-1-7-10-4
        - Cycle 3: 4-3-5-13-4
        - Cycle 4: 13-11-14-10-13
        - Cycle 5: 13-3-0-6-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 12)
        - Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 7)
        - Cycle 3 has one chord: (5, 13)
        - Cycle 4 has one chord: (11, 14)
        - Cycle 5 has one chord: (0, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <1, (9, 12), 4>
        <2, (1, 7), 10>
        <3, (5, 13), 4>
        <4, (11, 14), 13>
        <5, (0, 6), 13>
