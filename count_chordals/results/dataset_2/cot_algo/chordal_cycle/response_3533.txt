Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-9-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-4-3-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-4-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-9-6-1-0
- Cycle 5: 0-9-6-7-0
- Cycle 6: 0-9-7-3-0
- Cycle 7: 0-4-8-1-0
- Cycle 8: 0-4-8-7-0
- Cycle 9: 0-4-7-3-0
- Cycle 10: 0-4-7-6-0

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord
- Cycle 2 has no chord
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has no chord
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has no chord
- Cycle 7 has no chord
- Cycle 8 has no chord
- Cycle 9 has no chord
- Cycle 10 has no chord

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 10.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<0, 5, 9, 6>
<0, 5, 4, 3>
<0, 5, 4, 2>
<0, 9, 6, 1>
<0, 9, 6, 7>
<0, 9, 7, 3>
<0, 4, 8, 1>
<0, 4, 8, 7>
<0, 4, 7, 3>
<0, 4, 7, 6>
