Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 27) (1, 7) (3, 21) (3, 14) (22, 15) (22, 12) (23, 5) (23, 0) (23, 24) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (18, 17) (18, 25) (17, 18) (17, 12) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 21) (11, 28) (11, 14) (11, 15) (28, 11) (24, 23) (24, 20) (26, 29) (26, 21) (26, 6) (21, 3) (21, 29) (21, 26) (21, 15) (9, 29) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 7) (12, 22) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 13) (25, 18) (25, 27) (27, 1) (27, 25) (27, 2) (2, 12) (2, 27) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 10) (19, 2) (19, 20) (19, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (7, 16) (16, 9) (16, 7) (8, 5) (8, 20) (6, 1) (6, 26) (6, 2) (6, 20) (5, 23) (5, 4) (5, 8) (0, 23) (0, 19) (0, 10) (0, 15) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 0) (13, 4) (13, 12) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 15) (15, 22) (15, 11) (15, 21) (15, 0) (15, 14) (20, 24) (20, 19) (20, 8) (20, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 2, 27, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 7, 9, 29, 21, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 7, 16, 9, 29, 21, 15, 0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 21, 29, 26, 6, 1, 27, 2, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 21, 29, 9, 7, 1, 27, 2, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 14, 11, 28, 15, 22, 12, 4, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 14, 11, 15, 0, 19, 2, 27, 1, 7, 9, 16, 7, 3)
- Cycle 8: (22, 15, 21, 29, 26, 6, 20, 24, 23, 5, 22)
- Cycle 9: (22, 12, 17, 18, 25, 27, 1, 6, 26, 29, 21, 15, 11, 14, 3, 22)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, (2, 27), 6>
- <1, (7, 9), 29, 21>
- <1, (7, 16), 9, 29>
- <3, (14, 11), 15, 22>
- <3, (14, 11), 15, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final chordal 4-cycle count is [5].
