Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 18) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 28) (3, 1) (3, 27) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 27) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 20) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 4) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 19) (29, 17) (29, 19) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 7) (24, 20) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 21) (15, 1) (15, 28) (2, 13) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 4) (22, 2) (22, 25) (7, 24) (7, 23) (16, 1) (16, 21) (16, 27) (21, 26) (21, 16) (21, 18) (14, 28) (14, 5) (25, 22) (25, 27) (25, 5) (27, 3) (27, 8) (27, 16) (27, 25) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 21) (18, 23) (5, 26) (5, 14) (5, 25) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 19) (23, 7) (23, 18) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 24) (20, 26) (19, 17) (19, 29) (19, 2) (19, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 0) (28, 1) (28, 15) (28, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

Cycles with length 4:
- (1, 3, 27, 8, 1)
- (9, 18, 21, 26, 9)
- (13, 20, 26, 21, 13)
- (10, 12, 9, 18, 10)
- (20, 8, 13, 2, 20)
- (26, 21, 18, 9, 26)
- (4, 0, 17, 29, 4)
- (16, 21, 26, 20, 16)
- (2, 4, 0, 17, 2)
- (16, 1, 15, 28, 16)
- (5, 25, 27, 3, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <1, (8, 27), 3>
2. <9, (18, 21), 26>
3. <13, (20, 26), 21>
4. <12, (9, 18), 10>
5. <20, (8, 13), 26>
6. <26, (21, 18), 9>
7. <4, (0, 17), 29>
8. <16, (21, 26), 20>
9. <2, (4, 17), 0>
10. <16, (15, 28), 1>
11. <5, (25, 27), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:

There are 11 chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [11].
