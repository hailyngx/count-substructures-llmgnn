Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 1, 8, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 7, 0, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 6, 0, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 0, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 0, 3, 8, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 0, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 2, 0, 6, 5)
- Cycle 9: (9, 4, 7, 0, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 4, 6, 0, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 2, 0, 5, 9)
- Cycle 12: (4, 7, 0, 6, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 7, 9, 1, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 6, 0, 2, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 6, 0, 5, 4)
- Cycle 16: (7, 0, 6, 4, 7)
- Cycle 17: (7, 0, 3, 8, 7)
- Cycle 18: (1, 9, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 19: (1, 9, 2, 0, 1)
- Cycle 20: (3, 0, 6, 4, 3)
- Cycle 21: (3, 0, 5, 2, 3)
- Cycle 22: (8, 1, 9, 4, 8)
- Cycle 23: (8, 1, 9, 7, 8)
- Cycle 24: (8, 3, 0, 6, 8)
- Cycle 25: (8, 3, 0, 5, 8)
- Cycle 26: (0, 6, 4, 7, 0)
- Cycle 27: (0, 6, 4, 5, 0)
- Cycle 28: (0, 7, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 29: (0, 7, 9, 1, 0)
- Cycle 30: (0, 3, 8, 1, 0)
- Cycle 31: (0, 3, 8, 5, 0)
- Cycle 32: (0, 5, 2, 9, 0)
- Cycle 33: (0, 5, 9, 1, 0)
- Cycle 34: (2, 0, 6, 4, 2)
- Cycle 35: (2, 0, 5, 9, 2)
- Cycle 36: (6, 4, 7, 0, 6)
- Cycle 37: (6, 4, 5, 0, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 is chordal with <4, 7> as the chord.
- Cycle 2 is chordal with <1, 8> as the chord.
- Cycle 3 is chordal with <5, 0> as the chord.
- Cycle 4 is chordal with <4, 6> as the chord.
- Cycle 8 is chordal with <0, 6> as the chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [5].
