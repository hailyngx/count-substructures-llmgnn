Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (9, 0) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (4, 3, 5, 2, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 3, 6, 5, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord (3, 5) connecting non-adjacent nodes 3 and 5.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (3, 5) connecting non-adjacent nodes 3 and 5.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There is a total of [2] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (3, 5), 2>
- <2, (3, 5), 4>
