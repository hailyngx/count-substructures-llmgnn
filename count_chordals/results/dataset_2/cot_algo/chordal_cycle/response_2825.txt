Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the given graph, but not all of them have exactly one chord. 

The cycles of length 4 along with their chords are as follows:
1. <5, 1, 3, 9> (5, 9) is the chord. This cycle is chordal.
2. <5, 4, 7, 6> (5, 6) is the chord. This cycle is chordal.
3. <9, 8, 1, 5> (9, 5) is the chord. This cycle is chordal.
4. <9, 2, 0, 4> (9, 4) is the chord. This cycle is chordless.
5. <4, 7, 3, 1> (4, 1) is the chord. This cycle is chordless.
6. <7, 6, 8, 9> (7, 9) is the chord. This cycle is chordal.
7. <1, 5, 7, 3> (1, 3) is the chord. This cycle is chordal.
8. <3, 4, 7, 6> (3, 6) is the chord. This cycle is chordless.
9. <8, 1, 5, 7> (8, 7) is the chord. This cycle is chordless.
10. <6, 7, 5, 1> (6, 1) is the chord. This cycle is chordless.
11. <2, 9, 8, 1> (2, 1) is the chord. This cycle is chordless.
12. <0, 4, 7, 3> (0, 3) is the chord. This cycle is chordless.

Step 2:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we have 5 chordal cycles.

Hence, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
