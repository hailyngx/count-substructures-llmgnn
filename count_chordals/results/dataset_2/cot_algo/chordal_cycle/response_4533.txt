Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 18) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 18) (10, 3) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 1) (18, 15) (18, 13) (19, 2) (19, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 1) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (0, 13, 12, 7, 11)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 13, 12, 3, 10)
        - Cycle 3: (0, 13, 12, 7, 14)
        - Cycle 4: (0, 13, 18, 15, 0)
        - Cycle 5: (1, 14, 7, 11, 9)
        - Cycle 6: (1, 14, 2, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 7: (1, 14, 2, 19, 4)
        - Cycle 8: (1, 14, 7, 12, 13)
        - Cycle 9: (1, 14, 7, 12, 3)
        - Cycle 10: (1, 14, 2, 6, 0)
        - Cycle 11: (1, 14, 2, 5, 4)
        - Cycle 12: (1, 13, 12, 7, 11)
        - Cycle 13: (1, 13, 12, 3, 10)
        - Cycle 14: (1, 13, 18, 15, 0)
        - Cycle 15: (1, 9, 11, 7, 14)
        - Cycle 16: (1, 9, 17, 3, 12)
        - Cycle 17: (1, 9, 17, 3, 10)
        - Cycle 18: (2, 6, 0, 13, 12)
        - Cycle 19: (2, 6, 0, 15, 18)
        - Cycle 20: (2, 6, 5, 4, 19)
        - ... (other cycles)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - <0, 13, 12, 7, 11> has exactly one chord (12, 7).
        - <0, 13, 12, 3, 10> has exactly one chord (12, 3).
        - <0, 13, 12, 7, 14> has exactly one chord (12, 7).
        - ... (other cycles and chords)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        
        There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
