Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows (listed without repeating nodes): 
1. Cycle: 0-6-8-9-2-0
2. Cycle: 0-6-7-1-5-3-0
3. Cycle: 0-6-7-8-4-0
4. Cycle: 1-5-9-8-7-0-6-3-2-9-1

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 0-6-8-9-2-0 has 2 chords: (6, 9) and (8, 2)
2. Cycle 0-6-7-1-5-3-0 has 1 chord: (6, 1)
3. Cycle 0-6-7-8-4-0 has 2 chords: (6, 8) and (7, 4)
4. Cycle 1-5-9-8-7-0-6-3-2-9-1 has 2 chords: (5, 8) and (9, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 1 chordless cycle found, which is: <1, 5, 9, 8>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
