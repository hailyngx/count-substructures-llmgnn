Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1 - 6 - 8 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 6 - 0 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 9 - 7 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 9 - 7 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 5: 3 - 7 - 2 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 6: 4 - 8 - 5 - 2 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord (8, 1)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (0, 6)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 4 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 5 has a chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (8, 1), 6)>
<2, (0, 6), 1)>
<3, (7, 9), 1)>
<6, (5, 8), 4)>
