Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 15) (14, 0) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 19) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 19) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 15) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (9, 4) (9, 17) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 10) (18, 6) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 4) (17, 7) (17, 8) (17, 9) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges are:
1. Cycle <0, 3, 11, 13>
2. Cycle <0, 3, 5, 10>
3. Cycle <0, 14, 10, 5>
4. Cycle <1, 6, 3, 5>
5. Cycle <1, 6, 19, 2>
6. Cycle <2, 7, 12, 8>
7. Cycle <3, 6, 1, 8>
8. Cycle <4, 9, 17, 8>
9. Cycle <7, 12, 2, 19>
10. Cycle <7, 13, 11, 3>
11. Cycle <10, 14, 0, 3>
12. Cycle <13, 4, 10, 5>

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <1, 6, 3, 5>.  

Step 3:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
