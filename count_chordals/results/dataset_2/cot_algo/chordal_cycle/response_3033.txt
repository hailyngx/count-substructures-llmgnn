Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 1) - not a valid cycle
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 2, 25, 15, 6, 15, 25, 2, 5, 1) - valid cycle
- Cycle 3: (2, 26, 24, 14, 10, 19, 8, 12, 7, 27, 22, 11, 18, 3, 17, 13, 20, 21, 0, 8, 19, 24) - valid cycle
- Cycle 4: (3, 21, 20, 13, 17, 3) - valid cycle
- Cycle 5: (6, 15, 25, 11, 22, 27, 7, 12, 1, 5, 2, 25) - valid cycle
- Cycle 6: (7, 12, 27, 22, 11, 18, 29, 26, 24, 14, 0, 21, 3, 17, 13, 20) - valid cycle
- Cycle 7: (8, 12, 1, 5, 2, 26, 24, 14, 0, 8, 12) - valid cycle
- Cycle 8: (8, 19, 10, 14, 24, 26, 2, 5, 1, 12, 8) - valid cycle
- Cycle 9: (10, 14, 0, 21, 20, 13, 25, 2, 26, 24, 19, 8) - valid cycle
- Cycle 10: (11, 22, 1, 5, 2, 26, 29, 18, 3, 21, 0, 14, 24) - valid cycle
- Cycle 11: (12, 7, 27, 22, 11, 18, 3, 21, 0, 14, 24, 26, 29, 18) - valid cycle
- Cycle 12: (13, 17, 3, 21, 0, 14, 24, 26, 29, 18, 11, 15, 6, 15, 25, 13) - valid cycle
- Cycle 13: (17, 3, 21, 0, 8, 12, 1, 5, 2, 26, 24, 14, 10, 19, 8) - valid cycle
- Cycle 14: (18, 11, 22, 27, 7, 12, 1, 5, 2, 26, 24, 19, 8, 0, 21, 3, 18) - valid cycle
- Cycle 15: (22, 11, 18, 29, 26, 24, 14, 0, 21, 3, 17, 13, 20, 21, 0, 8, 19, 24, 26, 29, 18) - valid cycle
- Cycle 16: (25, 2, 26, 24, 14, 0, 21, 3, 17, 13, 20, 21, 0, 8, 12, 7, 27, 22, 11, 18, 29, 26, 25) - valid cycle

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 2 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (8, 19).
- Cycle 4 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 5 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (11, 18).
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (1, 5).
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (14, 24).
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (10, 19).
- Cycle 10 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (7, 27).
- Cycle 12 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (8, 12).
- Cycle 14 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 15 has a chord: (22, 27).
- Cycle 16 does not have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 6 chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<2, 26, 24, 14>, <3, 21, 20, 13>, <8, 19, 24, 14>, <10, 14, 0, 21>, <12, 7, 27, 22>, <18, 11, 22, 27>.
