Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 3-1-10-6-9-11-0-3
- Cycle 2: 3-1-10-6-8-7-4-3
- Cycle 3: 3-5-14-7-8-6-12-5
- Cycle 4: 3-5-14-0-7-4-13-3
- Cycle 5: 3-0-11-9-6-12-8-3
- Cycle 6: 3-0-11-5-14-7-4-3
- Cycle 7: 3-1-10-2-8-6-12-3
- Cycle 8: 3-5-14-0-11-9-6-3
- Cycle 9: 3-5-14-0-11-13-4-3
- Cycle 10: 3-1-10-2-13-4-7-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: 3-1-10-6-9-11-0-3 (Chord: 10-6)
- Cycle 2: 3-1-10-6-8-7-4-3 (Chord: 6-8)
- Cycle 3: 3-5-14-7-8-6-12-5 (Chord: 8-12)
- Cycle 4: 3-5-14-0-7-4-13-3 (Chord: 7-13)
- Cycle 5: 3-0-11-9-6-12-8-3 (Chord: 9-12)
- Cycle 6: 3-0-11-5-14-7-4-3 (Chord: 11-5)
- Cycle 7: 3-1-10-2-8-6-12-3 (Chord: 2-8)
- Cycle 8: 3-5-14-0-11-9-6-3 (Chord: 11-9)
- Cycle 9: 3-5-14-0-11-13-4-3 (Chord: 11-13)
- Cycle 10: 3-1-10-2-13-4-7-3 (Chord: 13-7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 10 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <3, 1, 10, 6> (Chord: 10-6)
- <3, 1, 10, 8> (Chord: 6-8)
- <3, 5, 14, 8> (Chord: 8-12)
- <3, 5, 14, 13> (Chord: 7-13)
- <3, 0, 11, 12> (Chord: 9-12)
- <3, 0, 11, 5> (Chord: 11-5)
- <3, 1, 10, 2> (Chord: 2-8)
- <3, 5, 14, 11> (Chord: 11-9)
- <3, 5, 14, 13> (Chord: 11-13)
- <3, 1, 10, 7> (Chord: 13-7)
