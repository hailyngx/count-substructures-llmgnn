Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 3, 7, 12, 1)
- (1, 3, 10, 4, 1)
- (1, 3, 10, 0, 2, 6, 5, 9, 13, 1)
- (1, 4, 11, 7, 3, 1)
- (1, 4, 11, 7, 10, 0, 2, 6, 5, 9, 13, 1)
- (1, 8, 13, 9, 5, 6, 2, 0, 10, 4, 1)
- (1, 12, 7, 11, 4, 1)
- (1, 12, 7, 3, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
1. <1, 3, 7, 12>, (1, 4)
2. <1, 4, 11, 7>, (1, 3)
3. <1, 8, 13, 9>, (1, 5)
4. <1, 8, 13, 9>, (1, 6)
5. <1, 8, 13, 9>, (1, 2)
6. <1, 12, 7, 11>, (1, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
