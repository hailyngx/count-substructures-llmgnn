Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 15) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 15) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 14) (6, 11) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 15) (16, 3) (16, 17) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 2) (15, 17) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (18, 8) (18, 12) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 1, 13, 4, 7, 12, 2, 3)
- Cycle 2: (1, 13, 4, 7, 11, 0, 15, 2, 12, 1)
- Cycle 3: (3, 1, 13, 10, 19, 9, 17, 16, 3)
- Cycle 4: (7, 4, 13, 10, 19, 0, 11, 7)
- Cycle 5: (12, 5, 8, 18, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, 1, 13, 4, 2>
- <7, 4, 13, 10, 7>
- <3, 1, 13, 10, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
