Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 19) (1, 0) (1, 27) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 23) (4, 23) (4, 10) (4, 28) (7, 20) (7, 18) (18, 7) (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 12) (20, 7) (20, 25) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 15) (25, 28) (15, 25) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 29) (17, 29) (17, 12) (17, 27) (17, 11) (29, 15) (29, 17) (2, 23) (2, 14) (8, 18) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 27) (6, 22) (6, 20) (6, 5) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 26) (19, 3) (19, 23) (26, 15) (26, 19) (13, 21) (13, 5) (13, 14) (16, 0) (16, 14) (28, 4) (28, 25) (28, 3) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 12) (10, 21) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 12) (27, 1) (27, 25) (27, 17) (27, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 16) (3, 19) (3, 28) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 16) (14, 3) (12, 22) (12, 17) (12, 9) (12, 10) (23, 21) (23, 4) (23, 2) (23, 19) (11, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: (1, 19, 15, 26, 19)  
- Cycle 2: (4, 23, 2, 14, 4)  
- Cycle 3: (7, 20, 25, 27, 1, 19, 15, 25, 20, 7)  
- Cycle 4: (7, 20, 25, 28, 3, 14, 2, 23, 4, 28, 25, 20, 7)  
- Cycle 5: (18, 22, 6, 5, 13, 14, 3, 28, 4, 10, 21, 23, 2, 14, 13, 21, 18)  
- Cycle 6: (18, 9, 10, 4, 28, 25, 15, 19, 1, 27, 25, 20, 6, 22, 18)  
- Cycle 7: (22, 18, 9, 12, 17, 29, 15, 26, 19, 1, 27, 17, 12, 22)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (15, 19)  
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (2, 14)  
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (26, 19)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
There are 4 chordless cycles found.  

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [4].  

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:  
- <1, (15, 19), 26>  
- <4, (2, 14), 23>  
- <7, (26, 19), 22>  
- <7, (26, 19), 22>
