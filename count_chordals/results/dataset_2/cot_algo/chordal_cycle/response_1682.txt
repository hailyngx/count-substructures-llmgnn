Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 8) (10, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 6, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, 2, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 10.
- Node 3 is connected to node 11.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 0, 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 1, 0, 10, 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 8, 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 11, 10, 13, 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 0, 10.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 11, 1.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 13, 2, 8.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 12, 13, 3.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 12, 11, 10, 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 13.

Now, let's find the chordal 4-cycles in this graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- There are no cycles to check for chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal 4-cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
