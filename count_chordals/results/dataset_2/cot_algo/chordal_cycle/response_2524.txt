Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 5) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 17) (13, 16) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 17) (7, 3) (7, 15) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 12) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 18) (1, 12) (2, 3) (2, 15) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 17) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 3) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 9) (18, 0) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-8-5-17-4
- Cycle 2: 4-16-13-12-4
- Cycle 3: 4-16-12-1-4
- Cycle 4: 4-16-13-12-17-4
- Cycle 5: 4-16-12-17-9-4
- Cycle 6: 4-9-15-2-4
- Cycle 7: 4-9-15-11-4
- Cycle 8: 8-5-17-12-8
- Cycle 9: 8-5-17-12-1-8
- Cycle 10: 8-5-17-12-10-8
- Cycle 11: 8-5-17-12-1-14-10-13-16-8
- Cycle 12: 8-5-17-12-10-14-0-6-8
- Cycle 13: 8-5-17-12-10-14-6-0-18-8
- Cycle 14: 8-5-17-12-10-14-6-18-3-8
- Cycle 15: 8-5-17-12-10-14-0-18-11-19-8

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 13(12), 5>
- <1, 3(12), 5>
- <1, 12, 13, 15(14), 17>
- <5, 12, 13, 15(14), 17>
- <9, 11, 15, 17>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
