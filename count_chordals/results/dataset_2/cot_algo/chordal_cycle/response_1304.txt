        - Cycle 30: (21, 29, 4, 2, 22, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <11, (10, 20), 27>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <11, (27, 9), 15>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <11, (20, 15), 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <11, (26, 17), 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <16, (8, 27), 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <16, (28, 8), 20>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <16, (4, 2), 22>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <20, (11, 26), 17>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <20, (15, 9), 27>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <20, (3, 5), 22>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <26, (16, 28), 8>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <28, (11, 20), 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <28, (4, 2), 22>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 14: <17, (26, 11), 16>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 15: <23, (14, 6), 17>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 16: <9, (27, 8), 28>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 17: <12, (17, 6), 14>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 18: <21, (5, 0), 17>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 19: <21, (19, 5), 0>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 20: <21, (29, 4), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are 30 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [30].
