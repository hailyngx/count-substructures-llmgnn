Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

There are several cycles in the graph, but we're interested in finding chordal 4-cycles. Let's list some of the cycles:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-3-1-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-7-4-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-0-7-5
- Cycle 4: 5-2-6-1-5
- Cycle 5: 5-8-7-0-5
- Cycle 6: 5-4-3-1-5
- Cycle 7: 5-0-9-3-5
- Cycle 8: 9-5-6-1-9
- Cycle 9: 9-5-2-6-9
- Cycle 10: 9-5-8-7-9
- Cycle 11: 9-7-4-3-9
- Cycle 12: 9-3-1-6-9
- Cycle 13: 9-0-5-4-9
- Cycle 14: 6-5-8-7-6
- Cycle 15: 6-2-5-4-6
- Cycle 16: 6-1-3-9-6
- Cycle 17: 4-5-0-7-4
- Cycle 18: 4-7-9-5-4
- Cycle 19: 4-3-1-6-4
- Cycle 20: 7-9-0-5-7
- Cycle 21: 7-4-5-2-7
- Cycle 22: 7-8-5-0-7
- Cycle 23: 1-6-2-5-1
- Cycle 24: 1-3-4-7-1
- Cycle 25: 3-9-5-8-3
- Cycle 26: 3-4-2-5-3
- Cycle 27: 8-5-0-9-8
- Cycle 28: 8-6-2-4-8
- Cycle 29: 8-7-4-3-8
- Cycle 30: 0-5-4-3-0
- Cycle 31: 0-9-7-8-0
- Cycle 32: 0-7-2-5-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

Among these cycles, we find the following chordal 4-cycle:
- <5, 9, 7, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
