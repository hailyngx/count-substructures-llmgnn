2. Chordal 4-cycle: <16, (19, 4), 25>
3. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (21, 22), 23>
4. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (0, 4), 19>
5. Chordal 4-cycle: <21, (22, 29), 5>
6. Chordal 4-cycle: <22, (21, 29), 5>
7. Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (25, 18), 27>
8. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (11, 12), 19>
9. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (29, 21), 22>
10. Chordal 4-cycle: <25, (8, 15), 7>
