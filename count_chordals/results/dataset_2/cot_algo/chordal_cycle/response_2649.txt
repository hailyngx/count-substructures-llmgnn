Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 18) (12, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (5, 12) (5, 10) (19, 1) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 18) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-15-4-11-3
- Cycle 2: 3-15-2-9-3
- Cycle 3: 3-9-2-10-3
- Cycle 4: 3-7-0-17-3
- Cycle 5: 3-7-4-8-3
- Cycle 6: 3-8-14-13-3
- Cycle 7: 3-0-17-13-3
- Cycle 8: 15-4-7-0-15
- Cycle 9: 15-4-8-14-15
- Cycle 10: 15-2-9-10-15
- Cycle 11: 4-11-16-17-4
- Cycle 12: 9-2-14-13-9
- Cycle 13: 16-17-13-14-16
- Cycle 14: 6-18-1-12-6
- Cycle 15: 6-18-12-5-6
- Cycle 16: 17-0-7-4-17
- Cycle 17: 17-0-3-15-17
- Cycle 18: 17-13-14-2-17
- Cycle 19: 1-12-18-6-1
- Cycle 20: 1-12-5-10-1

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <3, (15, 4), 11, 3> - Chord: 15-4
- <3, 15, (2, 9), 3> - Chord: 2-9
- <3, (9, 10), 2, 3> - Chord: 9-10
- <3, (7, 0), 17, 3> - Chord: 7-0
- <3, 7, (4, 8), 3> - Chord: 4-8
- <3, 8, (14, 13), 3> - Chord: 14-13
- <3, 0, (17, 13), 3> - Chord: 17-13
- <15, (4, 7), 0, 15> - Chord: 4-7
- <15, 4, (8, 14), 15> - Chord: 8-14
- <15, 2, (9, 10), 15> - Chord: 9-10
- <4, (11, 16), 17, 4> - Chord: 11-16
- <9, 2, (14, 13), 9> - Chord: 14-13
- <16, (17, 13), 14, 16> - Chord: 17-13
- <6, (18, 12), 5, 6> - Chord: 18-12
- <17, 0, (7, 4), 17> - Chord: 7-4
- <17, 0, (3, 15), 17> - Chord: 3-15
- <17, 13, (14, 2), 17> - Chord: 14-2
- <1, (12, 18), 6, 1> - Chord: 12-18
- <1, (12, 5), 10, 1> - Chord: 12-5

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- 17 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final result is [17].
