        - <6, 1, 10, 11, 6> (Chord: (6, 1))
        - <6, 8, 4, 0, 6> (Chord: (6, 8))
        - <7, 0, 3, 1, 7> (Chord: (7, 0))
        - <9, 3, 1, 10, 9> (Chord: (9, 3))
        - <9, 3, 7, 0, 9> (Chord: (9, 3))

        - <13, 2, 12, 4, 13> (Chord: (13, 2))
        - <13, 5, 1, 10, 13> (Chord: (13, 5))
        - <13, 5, 14, 11, 13> (Chord: (13, 5))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 41 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the count will be [41].
