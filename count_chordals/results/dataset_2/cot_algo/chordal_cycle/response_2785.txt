Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 12) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 10) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 19) (18, 5) (2, 15) (2, 9) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in these cycles:
- <11, 16, 17, 14, (5, 6)> [1]
- <11, 16, 17, (6, 0), 7> [1]
- <11, 16, 15, 10, (8, 11)> [1]
- <16, 17, 14, 5, (4, 12)> [1]
- <16, 19, 9, (7, 1)> [1]
- <16, 15, 2, (9, 19)> [1]
- <14, 17, (6, 0), 7> [1]
- <14, 5, 4, 12, (0, 13)> [1]
- <17, 6, 0, (7, 1)> [1]
- <1, 3, 12, 4, (5, 14)> [1]

Step 3:
