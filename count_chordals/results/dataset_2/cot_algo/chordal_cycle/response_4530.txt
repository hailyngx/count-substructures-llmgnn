Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 2, 3)
- Cycle 2: (6, 5, 1, 8)
- Cycle 3: (6, 3, 2, 9)
- Cycle 4: (6, 0, 5, 1)
- Cycle 5: (9, 8, 1, 2)
- Cycle 6: (9, 4, 2, 3)
- Cycle 7: (9, 7, 5, 0)
- Cycle 8: (5, 0, 6, 9)
- Cycle 9: (5, 1, 8, 6)
- Cycle 10: (5, 4, 2, 3)
- Cycle 11: (0, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 12: (0, 5, 1, 8)
- Cycle 13: (7, 9, 2, 3)
- Cycle 14: (7, 5, 1, 8)
- Cycle 15: (8, 6, 9, 0)
- Cycle 16: (8, 3, 2, 9)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <6, 9, (2, 3), 6>  <!-- Chord: (2, 3) -->
- <6, 5, (1, 8), 6>  <!-- Chord: (1, 8) -->
- <6, 3, (2, 9), 6>  <!-- Chord: (2, 9) -->
- <6, 0, (5, 1), 6>  <!-- Chord: (5, 1) -->
- <9, 8, (1, 2), 9>  <!-- Chord: (1, 2) -->
- <9, 4, (2, 3), 9>  <!-- Chord: (2, 3) -->
- <9, 7, (5, 0), 9>  <!-- Chord: (5, 0) -->
- <5, 0, (6, 9), 5>  <!-- Chord: (6, 9) -->
- <5, 1, (8, 6), 5>  <!-- Chord: (8, 6) -->
- <5, 4, (2, 3), 5>  <!-- Chord: (2, 3) -->
- <0, 6, (9, 4), 0>  <!-- Chord: (9, 4) -->
- <0, 5, (1, 8), 0>  <!-- Chord: (1, 8) -->
- <7, 9, (2, 3), 7>  <!-- Chord: (2, 3) -->
- <7, 5, (1, 8), 7>  <!-- Chord: (1, 8) -->
- <8, 6, (9, 0), 8>  <!-- Chord: (9, 0) -->
- <8, 3, (2, 9), 8>  <!-- Chord: (2, 9) -->

Step 3: Final count of chordal 4-cycles: [16]
