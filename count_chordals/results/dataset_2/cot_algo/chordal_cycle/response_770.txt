Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 16) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 11) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 16) (4, 9) (18, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 18) (13, 5) (13, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 8) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 6) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 8) (12, 15) (12, 2) (1, 2) (1, 8) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 6) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 13) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 2 - 12 - 15 - 16 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 7 - 10 - 15 - 16 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 7 - 10 - 17 - 14 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 7 - 8 - 1 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 7 - 8 - 16 - 15 - 0
- Cycle 6: 0 - 14 - 17 - 11 - 19 - 5 - 13 - 9 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 7: 0 - 14 - 17 - 11 - 19 - 6 - 15 - 12 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 8: 0 - 16 - 15 - 12 - 2 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (2, 12), 15, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (7, 10), 15, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (7, 10), 17, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, (7, 8), 1, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (7, 8), 16, 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <0, (14, 17), 11, 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <0, (14, 17), 11, 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <0, (16, 15), 12, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [8].
