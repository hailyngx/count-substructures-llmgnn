Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (17, 6) (17, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 15) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 16) (4, 12) (4, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 15) (16, 7) (14, 4) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 18) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 8) (8, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 7, 17, 6)
- Cycle 2: (10, 0, 13, 5, 15, 10)
- Cycle 3: (2, 0, 1, 18, 13, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 7, 15, 16, 3)
- Cycle 5: (11, 19, 10, 15, 5, 11)
- Cycle 6: (4, 12, 13, 0, 2, 1, 18, 8, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 17)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (0, 5)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (0, 13)
- Cycle 4 has no chord
- Cycle 5 has a chord (10, 5)
- Cycle 6 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<6, 9, (6, 17), 7>
<10, 0, (0, 5), 13>
<11, 19, (10, 5), 15>
