Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 4, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (9, 5, 6, 4, 9)
        - Cycle 3: (9, 7, 0, 6, 9)
        - Cycle 4: (2, 9, 8, 3, 2)
        - Cycle 5: (2, 4, 3, 8, 2)
        - Cycle 6: (8, 2, 0, 7, 8)
        - Cycle 7: (7, 5, 9, 7)
        - Cycle 8: (7, 0, 6, 5, 7)
        - Cycle 9: (7, 2, 4, 5, 7)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (5, 6)
        - Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (9, 4)
        - Cycle 8 has exactly one chord (0, 5)
        - Cycle 9 has exactly one chord (2, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
        There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.

Putting it together, the count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        <1, (5, 6), 5)>
        <2, (9, 4), 5)>
        <8, (0, 5), 7)>
        <9, (2, 5), 7)>
