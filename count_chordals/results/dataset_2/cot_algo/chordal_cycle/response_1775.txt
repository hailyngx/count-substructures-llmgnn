Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
(1, 3, 7, 1)
(1, 3, 8, 1)
(1, 4, 5, 6, 1)
(1, 4, 5, 9, 1)
(1, 4, 7, 3, 1)
(1, 7, 3, 9, 1)
(1, 8, 3, 9, 1)
(1, 8, 4, 7, 1)
(2, 3, 7, 1, 2)
(2, 6, 0, 7, 2)
(2, 6, 5, 4, 2)
(3, 1, 7, 4, 3)
(3, 1, 8, 4, 3)
(3, 2, 6, 5, 3)
(3, 7, 1, 8, 3)
(4, 7, 3, 1, 4)
(4, 7, 1, 9, 4)
(5, 4, 7, 1, 5)
(5, 6, 2, 3, 5)
(6, 2, 3, 1, 6)
(7, 1, 9, 3, 7)
(8, 1, 9, 3, 8)
(8, 2, 3, 7, 8)
(9, 1, 7, 3, 9)
(9, 5, 6, 2, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
(1, 4, 5, 6, 1) - Chord: (5, 4)
(1, 4, 5, 9, 1) - Chord: (5, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
[23]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, 4, 5, 6>
<1, 4, 5, 9>
