Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (1, 4, 7, 5) with edges (1, 4), (4, 7), (7, 5), (5, 1)
        - Cycle 2: (1, 3, 5, 7) with edges (1, 3), (3, 5), (5, 7), (7, 1)
        - Cycle 3: (2, 7, 4, 1) with edges (2, 7), (7, 4), (4, 1), (1, 2)
        - Cycle 4: (0, 2, 7, 4) with edges (0, 2), (2, 7), (7, 4), (4, 0)
        - Cycle 5: (0, 7, 9, 8) with edges (0, 7), (7, 9), (9, 8), (8, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - None of the cycles listed above have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        As none of the cycles have exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
