Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 0) (18, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 19) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 2) (17, 6) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 9) (16, 7) (16, 4) (15, 0) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 15) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (2, 13, 10, 1, 11, 3, 18, 0, 15, 0, 11, 4, 14, 7, 16, 4) - 16 nodes
- Cycle 2: (2, 13, 9, 12, 8, 5, 19, 7, 16, 4, 11, 1, 10, 13) - 14 nodes
- Cycle 3: (2, 17, 6, 12, 8, 5, 19, 7, 16, 4, 14, 10, 1, 11) - 14 nodes

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the listed cycles, we can see that there is exactly one chord in Cycle 1 which is (4, 14).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (4, 14), 16>.
