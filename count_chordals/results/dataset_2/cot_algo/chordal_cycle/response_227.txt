Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-1-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-3-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-4-6-0
- Cycle 4: 0-6-2-9-0
- Cycle 5: 0-6-4-5-0
- Cycle 6: 0-7-3-5-0
- Cycle 7: 1-5-3-2-1
- Cycle 8: 1-6-4-0-1
- Cycle 9: 2-3-5-1-2
- Cycle 10: 2-6-4-0-2
- Cycle 11: 2-9-6-4-2
- Cycle 12: 3-5-4-6-3
- Cycle 13: 7-0-5-4-7
- Cycle 14: 7-3-5-1-7
- Cycle 15: 9-2-1-6-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4: 0-6-2-9-0 has one chord (6, 2)
- Cycle 6: 0-7-3-5-0 has one chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 8: 1-6-4-0-1 has one chord (6, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 6, (6, 2), 9>
- <0, 7, (7, 3), 5>
- <1, 6, (6, 4), 0>
