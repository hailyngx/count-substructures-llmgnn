Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (6, 13) (6, 14) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 10 - 11 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 10 - 7 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 5 - 7 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 5 - 13 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 4 - 13 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 6: 0 - 4 - 13 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 7: 0 - 1 - 7 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 8: 0 - 1 - 12 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 9: 0 - 9 - 7 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 10: 1 - 11 - 2 - 13 - 1
- Cycle 11: 1 - 12 - 2 - 13 - 1
- Cycle 12: 1 - 12 - 14 - 1

Step 2:
From the listed cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 10, 11, 2> with a chord (0, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 5, 7, 2> with a chord (0, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 11, 2, 13> with a chord (1, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 12, 2, 13> with a chord (1, 12)

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles found: [8]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
