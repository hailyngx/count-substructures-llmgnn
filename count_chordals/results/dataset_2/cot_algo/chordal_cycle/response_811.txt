Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 4-7-5-6-4
2. Cycle 4-5-6-1-4
3. Cycle 4-2-6-1-4
4. Cycle 4-2-5-7-4
5. Cycle 4-9-2-1-4
6. Cycle 7-5-6-1-7
7. Cycle 7-5-2-4-7
8. Cycle 7-6-2-4-7
9. Cycle 5-6-2-4-5
10. Cycle 5-2-6-4-5
11. Cycle 5-2-1-6-5
12. Cycle 6-2-1-7-6
13. Cycle 6-2-4-7-6
14. Cycle 2-1-6-5-2
15. Cycle 2-1-4-7-2

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <4, (5, 6), 7> (Cycle 4-7-5-6-4 with chord 5-6)
2. <4, (6, 5), 2> (Cycle 4-5-6-1-4 with chord 5-6)
3. <4, (7, 5), 2> (Cycle 4-2-5-7-4 with chord 5-7)
4. <4, (7, 6), 5> (Cycle 4-9-2-1-4 with chord 7-6)
5. <7, (5, 6), 2> (Cycle 7-5-6-1-7 with chord 5-6)
6. <7, (5, 2), 4> (Cycle 7-5-2-4-7 with chord 5-2)
7. <7, (6, 2), 4> (Cycle 7-6-2-4-7 with chord 6-2)
8. <5, (6, 2), 4> (Cycle 5-6-2-4-5 with chord 6-2)
9. <5, (2, 6), 4> (Cycle 5-2-6-4-5 with chord 2-6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we have found 9 unique chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the final count is [9].
