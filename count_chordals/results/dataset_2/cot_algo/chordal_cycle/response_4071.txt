Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 0-2-3-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-2-8-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-6-3-1-0
- Cycle 4: 0-6-4-8-0
- Cycle 5: 1-5-4-6-1
- Cycle 6: 1-5-2-3-1
- Cycle 7: 8-4-6-0-8
- Cycle 8: 9-6-8-2-9
- Cycle 9: 9-6-0-1-9
- Cycle 10: 9-6-8-4-9
- Cycle 11: 9-7-1-5-9

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <0, (1, 3), 2> (Chord: 1-3)
- Cycle 2: <0, (4, 8), 2> (Chord: 4-8)
- Cycle 3: <0, (1, 3), 6> (Chord: 1-3)
- Cycle 4: <0, (4, 8), 6> (Chord: 4-8)
- Cycle 5: <1, (4, 6), 5> (Chord: 4-6)
- Cycle 6: <1, (2, 3), 5> (Chord: 2-3)
- Cycle 7: <4, (0, 8), 6> (Chord: 0-8)
- Cycle 8: <9, (2, 8), 6> (Chord: 2-8)
- Cycle 9: <9, (0, 1), 6> (Chord: 0-1)
- Cycle 10: <9, (4, 8), 6> (Chord: 4-8)
- Cycle 11: <9, (1, 5), 7> (Chord: 1-5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
Therefore, the final count is [10].
