Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 6, 9>
- <1, 4, 7, 8>
- <0, 3, 4, 7>
- <2, 8, 4, 1>
- <0, 2, 9, 5>
- <1, 6, 9, 5>
- <3, 6, 9, 5>
- <1, 4, 3, 0>
- <1, 6, 3, 4>
- <1, 7, 0, 5>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 6, 9> - chord: (5, 9)
- <1, 4, 7, 8> - chord: (4, 8)
- <0, 3, 4, 7> - chord: (4, 7)
- <2, 8, 4, 1> - chord: (4, 1)
- <0, 2, 9, 5> - chord: (2, 9)
- <1, 6, 9, 5> - chord: (6, 9)
- <3, 6, 9, 5> - chord: (6, 5)
- <1, 4, 3, 0> - chord: (4, 3)
- <1, 6, 3, 4> - chord: (3, 4)
- <1, 7, 0, 5> - chord: (7, 5)

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [0]

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
