Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (12, 10) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 13) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <4, 5, 7, 3, 4>
2. <4, 5, 11, 9, 4>
3. <4, 5, 13, 6, 4>
4. <4, 6, 9, 11, 4>
5. <4, 6, 13, 5, 4>
6. <4, 7, 5, 11, 4>
7. <4, 7, 6, 13, 4>
8. <4, 7, 3, 0, 4>
9. <5, 7, 1, 6, 5>
10. <5, 7, 3, 11, 5>
11. <5, 7, 4, 6, 5>
12. <5, 11, 9, 6, 5>
13. <5, 11, 10, 13, 5>
14. <5, 13, 6, 9, 5>
15. <6, 9, 11, 0, 6>
16. <6, 9, 11, 5, 6>
17. <6, 9, 13, 5, 6>
18. <6, 13, 5, 11, 6>
19. <7, 5, 11, 9, 7>
20. <7, 5, 13, 6, 7>
21. <7, 6, 13, 10, 7>
22. <7, 3, 0, 8, 7>
23. <9, 11, 10, 13, 9>
24. <10, 11, 3, 0, 10>
25. <11, 13, 1, 12, 11>
26. <13, 6, 1, 12, 13>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <4, 5, 7, 3, 4> with chord (7, 3)
2. <4, 5, 11, 9, 4> with chord (5, 9)
3. <4, 7, 5, 11, 4> with chord (5, 11)
4. <6, 9, 11, 0, 6> with chord (9, 11)
5. <6, 9, 13, 5, 6> with chord (9, 5)
6. <7, 3, 0, 8, 7> with chord (3, 8)
7. <11, 13, 1, 12, 11> with chord (13, 1)

Step 3:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final answer is [7].
