Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 0, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 3, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 5, 7, 6, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 1, 5, 9)
- Cycle 6: (6, 1, 3, 9, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 7, 5, 9, 6)
- Cycle 8: (1, 5, 3, 9, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 6, 0, 4, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 3, 2, 7, 1)
- Cycle 11: (3, 5, 7, 2, 3)
- Cycle 12: (3, 9, 6, 1, 3)
- Cycle 13: (4, 5, 7, 2, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 1, 3, 2, 4)
- Cycle 15: (7, 5, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 6, 0, 4, 7)
- Cycle 17: (2, 1, 6, 0, 2)
- Cycle 18: (2, 3, 5, 7, 2)
- Cycle 19: (2, 7, 5, 1, 2)
- Cycle 20: (2, 8, 1, 3, 2)
- Cycle 21: (8, 1, 5, 7, 8)
- Cycle 22: (8, 2, 3, 1, 8)
- Cycle 23: (0, 6, 1, 5, 0)
- Cycle 24: (0, 4, 7, 2, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (1, 6), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (0, 6), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (3, 1), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (7, 6), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (1, 5), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (3, 9), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, (5, 9), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <7, (5, 9), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <2, (1, 3), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <0, (6, 1), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [10]
