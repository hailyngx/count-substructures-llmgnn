Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 3, 2, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 8, 1, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 4, 7, 1, 9)
- Cycle 7: (6, 2, 3, 5, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 9, 5, 7, 6)
- Cycle 9: (1, 9, 6, 8, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 7, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 11: (3, 5, 7, 4, 3)
- Cycle 12: (3, 2, 6, 8, 3)
- Cycle 13: (4, 9, 1, 7, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 7, 5, 3, 4)
- Cycle 15: (7, 5, 3, 2, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 1, 9, 6, 7)
- Cycle 17: (7, 4, 8, 6, 7)
- Cycle 18: (8, 6, 9, 4, 8)
- Cycle 19: (8, 1, 7, 5, 8)
- Cycle 20: (2, 6, 9, 1, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <5, 9, 6, (8), 2, 5>
- <5, 9, 1, (7), 5>
- <5, 3, 2, (6), 5>
- <5, 7, 1, (9), 5>
- <9, 6, 8, (1), 9>
- <9, 4, 7, (1), 9>
- <6, 2, 3, (5), 6>
- <6, 9, 5, (7), 6>
- <1, 9, 6, (8), 1>
- <1, 7, 3, (5), 1>
- <3, 5, 7, (4), 3>
- <3, 2, 6, (8), 3>
- <4, 9, 1, (7), 4>
- <4, 7, 5, (3), 4>
- <7, 5, 3, (2), 7>
- <7, 1, 9, (6), 7>
- <7, 4, 8, (6), 7>
- <8, 6, 9, (4), 8>
- <8, 1, 7, (5), 8>
- <2, 6, 9, (1), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [20].
