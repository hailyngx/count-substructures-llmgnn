Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (6, 5, 1, 0, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 8, 9, 3, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 4, 9, 3, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 5, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 4, 1, 7, 6)
- Cycle 6: (5, 3, 9, 8, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 1, 7, 3, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 4, 2, 8, 5)
- Cycle 9: (1, 3, 9, 8, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 0, 6, 8, 1)
- Cycle 11: (3, 9, 8, 2, 3)
- Cycle 12: (3, 1, 7, 5, 3)
- Cycle 13: (4, 9, 8, 2, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 5, 7, 1, 4)
  
Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:

- The cycle <6, 5, 1, 0, 6> has a chord (5, 0).
- The cycle <6, 8, 9, 3, 6> has a chord (8, 3).
- The cycle <6, 4, 9, 3, 6> has a chord (4, 9).
- The cycle <6, 5, 3, 1, 6> has a chord (5, 1).
- The cycle <6, 4, 1, 7, 6> has a chord (4, 7).
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
