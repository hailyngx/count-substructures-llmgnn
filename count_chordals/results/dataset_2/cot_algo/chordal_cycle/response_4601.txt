Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 18) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (18, 17) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 10) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 2) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (16, 8) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the given graph, including:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 0 - 1 - 10 - 13 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 2: 7 - 0 - 4 - 3 - 9 - 2 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 3: 11 - 1 - 0 - 7 - 14 - 15 - 11
- Cycle 4: 12 - 6 - 13 - 10 - 12
- Cycle 5: 17 - 15 - 1 - 11 - 12 - 17
- Cycle 6: 18 - 17 - 14 - 7 - 5 - 6 - 18
- Cycle 7: 19 - 5 - 13 - 10 - 1 - 0 - 19

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

After checking for chords in each of the above cycles, we find that Cycle 4: 12 - 6 - 13 - 10 - 12 is the only chordal 4-cycle in the graph.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle in the graph, the final count is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <12, 6, 13, 10>.
