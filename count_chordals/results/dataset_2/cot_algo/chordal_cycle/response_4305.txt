Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 6) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 10, 14>
2. Cycle <8, 4, 13, 1>
3. Cycle <7, 5, 4, 8>
4. Cycle <2, 8, 0, 6>

Step 2:
Checking for one chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 10, 14> has one chord (9, 10).
2. Cycle <8, 4, 13, 1> has one chord (4, 13).
3. Cycle <7, 5, 4, 8> has one chord (5, 8).
4. Cycle <2, 8, 0, 6> has one chord (8, 0).

Step 3:
Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles: <5, 9, 10, 14>, <8, 4, 13, 1>, <7, 5, 4, 8>, <2, 8, 0, 6>
