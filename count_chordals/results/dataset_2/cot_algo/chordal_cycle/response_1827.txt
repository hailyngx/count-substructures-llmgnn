Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: 0-1-4-6-0
2. Cycle 2: 0-1-3-6-0
3. Cycle 3: 0-1-7-6-0
4. Cycle 4: 0-3-4-6-0
5. Cycle 5: 0-3-1-7-0
6. Cycle 6: 2-0-6-4-2
7. Cycle 7: 2-0-6-7-2
8. Cycle 8: 2-0-6-3-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-6-0 has chord (4, 6)
- Cycle 2: 0-1-3-6-0 has chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 3: 0-1-7-6-0 has chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 4: 0-3-4-6-0 has chord (3, 4)
- Cycle 5: 0-3-1-7-0 does not have a chord
- Cycle 6: 2-0-6-4-2 has chord (0, 4)
- Cycle 7: 2-0-6-7-2 has chord (0, 7)
- Cycle 8: 2-0-6-3-2 has chord (0, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

One chordless cycle is found, which is Cycle 5: <0, 1, 3, 7>

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
