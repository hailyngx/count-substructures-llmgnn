Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 8) (18, 14) (18, 13) (17, 15) (17, 1) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 10) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 2) (16, 4) (16, 2) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 11) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 10) (13, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3 - 15 - 4 - 16 - 2 - 3
- Cycle 2: 3 - 15 - 17 - 1 - 14 - 7 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 3: 9 - 15 - 17 - 1 - 10 - 5 - 19 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 4: 9 - 15 - 17 - 1 - 10 - 13 - 4 - 15 - 9
- Cycle 5: 9 - 15 - 4 - 13 - 18 - 14 - 7 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 6: 16 - 4 - 15 - 17 - 1 - 10 - 5 - 19 - 13 - 18 - 16
- Cycle 7: 7 - 19 - 5 - 10 - 1 - 17 - 15 - 4 - 13 - 11 - 7

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: No chord found.
- Cycle 2: Chord found: <3, 1>.
- Cycle 3: Chord found: <9, 1>.
- Cycle 4: Chord found: <9, 4>.
- Cycle 5: Chord found: <9, 7>.
- Cycle 6: No chord found.
- Cycle 7: Chord found: <7, 17>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <3, 1, 2, 16>
2. <9, 1, 14, 7>
3. <9, 4, 15, 13>
4. <9, 7, 14, 18>
