Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are four cycles of length 4: (5, 9, 6, 5), (5, 4, 8, 5), (4, 2, 9, 4), (6, 0, 7, 6).
- There are no cycles of length 5 or more.

Step 2:
- Checking for one chord in each 4-cycle:
    - (5, 9, 6, 5) has a chord (9, 6), so <1, (9, 6), 5> is a chordal 4-cycle.
    - (5, 4, 8, 5) has a chord (4, 8), so <2, (4, 8), 5> is a chordal 4-cycle.
    - (4, 2, 9, 4) has a chord (2, 9), so <3, (2, 9), 4> is a chordal 4-cycle.
    - (6, 0, 7, 6) has a chord (0, 7), so <4, (0, 7), 6> is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
- The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
