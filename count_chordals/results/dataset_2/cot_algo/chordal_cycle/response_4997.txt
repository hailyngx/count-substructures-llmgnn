The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 4) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 0) (26, 7) (5, 9) (5, 23) (2, 29) (2, 20) (2, 7) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 25) (7, 26) (7, 2) (21, 19) (21, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 28) (3, 1) (3, 27) (10, 11) (10, 22) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 0) (12, 17) (12, 22) (6, 1) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 15) (6, 8) (28, 1) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 13) (13, 28) (13, 16) (13, 23) (0, 26) (0, 11) (0, 28) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 27) (17, 4) (25, 29) (25, 6) (19, 21) (19, 22) (22, 10) (22, 12) (22, 19) (22, 24) (24, 11) (24, 22) (24, 8) (24, 23) (23, 5) (23, 13) (23, 24) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 24) (8, 15) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 17) (18, 20) (27, 9) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 17) (16, 13) (16, 20) (16, 15) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 16) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <9, 26, 7, 2>
- Cycle 2: <9, 29, 2, 7>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 27, 28>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 25, 29>
- Cycle 5: <1, 11, 0, 28>
- Cycle 6: <1, 11, 24, 23>
- Cycle 7: <1, 28, 27, 17>
- Cycle 8: <1, 28, 13, 23>
- Cycle 9: <10, 11, 24, 22>
- Cycle 10: <13, 28, 0, 11>
- Cycle 11: <13, 23, 24, 8>
- Cycle 12: <16, 20, 2, 7>
- Cycle 13: <16, 20, 18, 2>
- Cycle 14: <16, 20, 18, 2>
- Cycle 15: <17, 12, 22, 24>
- Cycle 16: <17, 12, 22, 24>
- Cycle 17: <17, 12, 22, 24>
- Cycle 18: <22, 10, 11, 0>
- Cycle 19: <22, 10, 11, 0>
- Cycle 20: <22, 24, 8, 6>
- Cycle 21: <22, 24, 8, 6>
- Cycle 22: <23, 5, 9, 29>
- Cycle 23: <23, 5, 9, 4>
- Cycle 24: <23, 13, 28, 1>
- Cycle 25: <24, 11, 0, 28>
- Cycle 26: <24, 11, 0, 28>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <9, 26, 7, 2, (29, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 3, 27, 28, (17, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 6, 25, 29, (11, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 11, 0, 28, (24, 23)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <13, 28, 0, 11, (23, 24)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <16, 20, 2, 7, (18, 16)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <17, 12, 22, 24, (8, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <23, 5, 9, 29, (4, 13)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- [18]
