Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2: 
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3:
- The number of chordless cycles found is 0.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
