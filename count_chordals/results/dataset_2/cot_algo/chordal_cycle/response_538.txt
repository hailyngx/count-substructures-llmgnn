Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <5, 7, 1, 13, 5> 
- Cycle 2: <9, 2, 11, 4, 9>
- Cycle 3: <10, 0, 6, 8, 10>
- Cycle 4: <12, 10, 0, 1, 12>
- Cycle 5: <14, 11, 2, 9, 14>

Step 2:
- Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
  - Cycle 1 has chord (7, 13)
  - Cycle 2 has chord (2, 4)
  - Cycle 3 has chord (0, 8)
  - Cycle 4 has chord (0, 12)
  - Cycle 5 has chord (9, 11)

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles: [0]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <5, 7, 1, 13, 5> with chord (7, 13)
- <9, 2, 11, 4, 9> with chord (2, 4)
- <10, 0, 6, 8, 10> with chord (0, 8)
- <12, 10, 0, 1, 12> with chord (0, 12)
- <14, 11, 2, 9, 14> with chord (9, 11)
