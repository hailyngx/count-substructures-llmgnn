Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
    There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. Here are some of them:
    - Cycle 1: 3-6-2-9-3
    - Cycle 2: 3-1-7-5-3
    - Cycle 3: 1-7-4-8-1
    - Cycle 4: 8-4-2-6-8
    
Step 2:
    Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - Cycle 1 (3-6-2-9-3): <(3, 9), (6, 2)>
    - Cycle 2 (3-1-7-5-3): <(1, 7), (3, 5)>
    - Cycle 3 (1-7-4-8-1): <(1, 4), (7, 8)>
    - Cycle 4 (8-4-2-6-8): <(8, 2), (4, 6)>
    
Step 3:
    Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have [4].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
    <3, 9, (3, 9), (6, 2)>
    <1, 7, (1, 7), (3, 5)>
    <1, 4, (1, 4), (7, 8)>
    <8, 2, (8, 2), (4, 6)>
