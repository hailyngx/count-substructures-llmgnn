Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
<0, 5, 10, 1, 0>
<0, 5, 10, 13, 0>
<0, 5, 6, 7, 0>
<0, 6, 7, 11, 0>
<1, 9, 8, 6, 1>
<1, 9, 7, 6, 1>
<2, 11, 7, 6, 2>
<2, 11, 10, 6, 2>
<3, 4, 13, 10, 3>
<3, 4, 13, 8, 3>
<3, 1, 9, 8, 3>
<12, 0, 5, 10, 12>
<12, 0, 6, 7, 12>
<12, 14, 2, 11, 12>
<13, 10, 11, 2, 13>
<13, 10, 5, 0, 13>

Step 2:
- The cycles with exactly one chord (forming a chordal 4-cycle) are:
<0, 5, 10, 1, 0> with chord (5, 10)
<0, 5, 10, 13, 0> with chord (5, 13)
<0, 6, 7, 11, 0> with chord (6, 11)
<1, 9, 8, 6, 1> with chord (9, 6)
<3, 4, 13, 10, 3> with chord (4, 13)
<12, 0, 5, 10, 12> with chord (0, 10)
<13, 10, 11, 2, 13> with chord (10, 11)

Step 3:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [7].
