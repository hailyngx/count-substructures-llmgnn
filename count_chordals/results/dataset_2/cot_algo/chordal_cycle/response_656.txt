Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (10, 7) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (4, 6, 1, 0, 4) 
- Cycle 2: (4, 6, 9, 12, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 6, 0, 1, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 6, 0, 9, 12, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 12, 7, 10, 3, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 12, 7, 11, 2, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 12, 7, 14, 3, 4)
- Cycle 8: (6, 9, 12, 4, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 9, 12, 7, 4, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 9, 0, 1, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 9, 0, 4, 6)
- Cycle 12: (7, 10, 3, 11, 7)
- Cycle 13: (7, 10, 3, 14, 4, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 11, 2, 12, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 11, 2, 14, 4, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 11, 3, 10, 7)
- Cycle 17: (7, 11, 3, 14, 4, 7)
- Cycle 18: (10, 3, 14, 4, 10)
- Cycle 19: (11, 2, 12, 7, 11)
- Cycle 20: (11, 2, 14, 4, 11)
- Cycle 21: (11, 3, 10, 7, 11)
- Cycle 22: (11, 3, 14, 4, 11)
- Cycle 23: (11, 7, 12, 9, 6, 4, 11)
- Cycle 24: (12, 2, 11, 7, 12)
- Cycle 25: (12, 2, 14, 4, 12)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <4, (6, 9), 12, 4> 
- <4, (6, 9), 0, 1, 4>
- <4, (6, 9), 0, 4, 6>
- <7, 10, (3, 14), 4, 7>
- <7, 11, 2, 12, 7>
- <7, 11, 2, 14, 4, 7>
- <7, 11, 3, 10, 7>
- <7, 11, 3, 14, 4, 7>
- <11, 2, (12, 7), 11>
- <11, 2, 14, 4, 11>
- <11, 3, 10, 7, 11>
- <11, 3, 14, 4, 11>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [4].
