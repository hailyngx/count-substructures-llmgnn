Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 16) (4, 15) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 3) (15, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (10, 5) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 11) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 18) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 6) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 12) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 6) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 12) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (14, 1) (19, 10) (19, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
    - There are three cycles of length 4 in the graph: (3, 15, 4, 8), (10, 17, 11, 0), (18, 6, 16, 0).

Step 2:
    - Cycle (3, 15, 4, 8) has a chord (4, 8).
    - Cycle (10, 17, 11, 0) does not have any chord.
    - Cycle (18, 6, 16, 0) does not have any chord.

Step 3:
    - There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
    
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <3, 15, 4, 8>, with the chord (4, 8).
