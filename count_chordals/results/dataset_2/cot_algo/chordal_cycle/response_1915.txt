Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 17) (16, 4) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 4) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 12) (10, 14) (13, 2) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 6) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 5) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (19, 4) (19, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 8) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 19) (9, 3) (9, 14) (7, 1) (7, 19) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 14) (6, 0) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 12) (18, 0) (18, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0-3-2-11-5-0
- Cycle 2: 1-15-12-8-5-11-2-13-1
- Cycle 3: 4-16-17-13-2-4
- Cycle 4: 7-1-15-18-0-6-13-7
- Cycle 5: 9-14-12-8-11-5-17-3-9
- Cycle 6: 14-1-7-19-4-16-17-13-14
- Cycle 7: 18-0-5-11-8-12-14-9-18

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, (2, 11), 5> as it contains one chord between nodes 2 and 11.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

As there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found, the count is [1].
