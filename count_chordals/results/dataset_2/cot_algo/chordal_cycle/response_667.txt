Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 17) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 6) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 10) (18, 19) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 6) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (11, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (17, 12) (6, 15) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 19) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are two cycles of length 4: (3, 15, 9, 1) and (4, 7, 12, 16).
- There are two cycles of length 5: (5, 13, 8, 3, 15) and (9, 1, 0, 16, 12).

Step 2:
- The cycle (3, 15, 9, 1) has a chord (15, 9) forming a chordal 4-cycle <3, (15, 9), 1>.
- The cycle (4, 7, 12, 16) has a chord (7, 12) forming a chordal 4-cycle <4, (7, 12), 16>.

Step 3:
Since we found 2 chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are <3, (15, 9), 1> and <4, (7, 12), 16>.
