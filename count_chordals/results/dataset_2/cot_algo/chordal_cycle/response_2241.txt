Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<11, 16, 4, 1>
<11, 16, 26, 14>
<11, 28, 23, 14>
<11, 28, 19, 12>
<11, 15, 6, 22>
<11, 15, 28, 23>
<16, 18, 20, 4>
<16, 26, 20, 4>
<16, 4, 27, 21>
<10, 17, 23, 14>
<10, 0, 25, 24>
<10, 0, 25, 20>
<20, 18, 29, 13>
<20, 4, 27, 21>
<25, 0, 1, 24>
<25, 24, 23, 28>
<23, 14, 26, 20>
<23, 14, 26, 16>
<23, 24, 25, 0>
<23, 28, 11, 9>
<7, 12, 19, 28>
<7, 12, 21, 27>
<12, 21, 27, 4>
<12, 19, 28, 11>
<12, 5, 21, 27>
<12, 5, 21, 27>
<28, 23, 14, 26>
<28, 19, 12, 21>
<4, 27, 23, 14>
<27, 23, 24, 25>
<9, 11, 28, 19>
<9, 24, 25, 0>
<29, 13, 20, 18>
<13, 29, 18, 16>
<13, 29, 18, 20>
<6, 15, 11, 28>
<15, 28, 11, 16>
<1, 4, 20, 18>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <11, 16, 4, 1> has a chord: (16, 4)
- <11, 16, 26, 14> has a chord: (16, 14)
- <11, 28, 23, 14> has a chord: (28, 14)
- <11, 15, 6, 22> has a chord: (15, 6)
- <16, 4, 27, 21> has a chord: (4, 27)
- <10, 0, 25, 24> has a chord: (0, 25)
- <20, 18, 29, 13> has a chord: (18, 29)
- <25, 0, 1, 24> has a chord: (0, 1)
- <23, 14, 26, 20> has a chord: (14, 26)
- <7, 12, 19, 28> has a chord: (12, 19)
- <27, 23, 24, 25> has a chord: (23, 24)
- <9, 24, 25, 0> has a chord: (24, 25)
- <13, 29, 18, 20> has a chord: (29, 18)
- <6, 15, 11, 28> has a chord: (15, 11)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph, which is <20, 4, 27, 21>.
