Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 8 - 4 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 9 - 3 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 10 - 11 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 5 - 12 - 0 - 6
- Cycle 5: 4 - 7 - 3 - 13 - 4
- Cycle 6: 4 - 7 - 11 - 12 - 4
- Cycle 7: 4 - 2 - 14 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 8: 7 - 11 - 12 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 9: 10 - 11 - 14 - 2 - 10
- Cycle 10: 7 - 3 - 9 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 11: 6 - 3 - 7 - 11 - 6
- Cycle 12: 6 - 12 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 13: 5 - 12 - 0 - 14 - 5
- Cycle 14: 4 - 2 - 0 - 12 - 4
- Cycle 15: 2 - 14 - 13 - 3 - 2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, 9, 8, 4> has one chord: (4,8)
- <6, 9, 3, 7> has one chord: (9,3)
- <6, 10, 11, 7> has one chord: (10,7)
- <6, 5, 12, 0> has one chord: (5,12)
- <4, 7, 3, 13> has one chord: (7,13)
- <4, 7, 11, 12> has one chord: (7,11)
- <4, 2, 14, 0> has one chord: (4,14)
- <7, 11, 12, 6> has one chord: (11,6)
- <10, 11, 14, 2> has one chord: (11,14)
- <7, 3, 9, 8> has one chord: (7,8)
- <6, 3, 7, 11> has one chord: (6,11)
- <6, 12, 5, 6> has one chord: (5,6)
- <5, 12, 0, 14> has one chord: (0,14)
- <4, 2, 0, 12> has one chord: (2,12)
- <2, 14, 13, 3> has one chord: (14,3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
