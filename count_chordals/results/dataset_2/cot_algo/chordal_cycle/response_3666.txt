Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 1) (27, 13) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 22) (1, 27) (1, 26) (1, 6) (14, 23) (14, 9) (14, 21) (17, 6) (17, 8) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 13) (26, 1) (26, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 23) (20, 28) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 13) (28, 11) (28, 20) (28, 8) (28, 25) (5, 19) (5, 29) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 2) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 8) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 24) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (12, 10) (22, 27) (22, 4) (22, 7) (22, 6) (24, 11) (24, 21) (24, 8) (0, 13) (23, 14) (23, 20) (16, 4) (16, 18) (25, 19) (25, 28) (25, 9) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 29) (8, 21) (8, 24) (13, 27) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 22, 27, 15, 10, 11, 13, 19, 26, 1, 6, 17) 
- Cycle 2: (4, 18, 16, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 18, 16, 13, 19, 26, 1, 27, 15, 10, 11, 13)
- Cycle 4: (7, 22, 6, 1, 26, 19, 13, 4) 
- Cycle 5: (15, 10, 11, 13, 19, 26, 1, 27)
- Cycle 6: (22, 27, 15, 10, 11, 13, 19, 26, 1, 6)
- Cycle 7: (1, 26, 19, 13, 4, 18, 16)
- Cycle 8: (1, 27, 15, 10, 11, 13, 19, 26)
- Cycle 9: (13, 19, 26, 1, 27, 15, 10, 11)
- Cycle 10: (13, 19, 26, 1, 6, 22, 27, 15)
- Cycle 11: (13, 19, 26, 1, 6, 22, 7, 4)
- Cycle 12: (19, 13, 4, 18, 9, 14, 21, 24)
- Cycle 13: (19, 13, 4, 18, 9, 25, 28, 20)
- Cycle 14: (19, 13, 4, 16, 18, 9, 25, 28)
- Cycle 15: (19, 13, 4, 16, 18, 9, 2, 6)
- Cycle 16: (26, 1, 6, 22, 7, 4, 18, 16) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <(4, 13), (7, 27)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <(4, 16), (18, 18)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <(4, 13), (18, 26)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <(4, 7), (6, 22)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <(10, 15), (11, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <(6, 27), (1, 26)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <(1, 26), (4, 18)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <(1, 27), (10, 11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <(6, 22), (7, 27)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <(6, 22), (4, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <(6, 22), (4, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <(18, 19), (9, 14)> 
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <(4, 28), (18, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <(4, 16), (6, 18)> 
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <(22, 27), (7, 4)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final number is [15].
