- Cycle 4: (4, 11, 24, 6, 25)
- Cycle 5: (7, 12, 15, 17, 3)
- Cycle 6: (7, 12, 15, 28, 0)
- Cycle 7: (7, 0, 26, 17, 3)

- Cycle 12: (20, 26, 0, 7, 12)
- Cycle 13: (20, 26, 18, 3, 17)
- Cycle 14: (20, 26, 17, 3, 18)
- Cycle 15: (25, 6, 16, 19, 8)

- Cycle 18: (2, 11, 4, 7, 0)
- Cycle 19: (2, 22, 21, 24, 6)
- Cycle 20: (2, 22, 29, 18, 3)
- Cycle 21: (29, 22, 2, 11, 4)
- Cycle 22: (29, 22, 21, 24, 6)
- Cycle 23: (29, 18, 25, 6, 24)
- Cycle 24: (12, 7, 0, 26, 20)
- Cycle 25: (12, 15, 17, 3, 18)
- Cycle 26: (12, 15, 28, 0, 7)
- Cycle 27: (6, 25, 18, 29, 22)

- Cycle 36: (22, 29, 18, 25, 6)
- Cycle 37: (13, 20, 26, 0, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (4, 7), 14>
- <2, (6, 25), 24>
- <3, (20, 26), 17>
- <4, (2, 11), 29>
- <5, (7, 0), 26>
- <6, (21, 22), 24>
- <7, (22, 29), 18>
- <8, (11, 4), 7>
- <9, (24, 6), 25>
- <10, (22, 21), 24>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [10]
