Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 14) (9, 23) (20, 26) (20, 6) (20, 28) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 21) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (28, 5) (28, 20) (28, 29) (28, 12) (28, 27) (29, 9) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 20) (26, 19) (26, 3) (26, 0) (22, 7) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 21) (10, 2) (10, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 23) (13, 7) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (0, 26) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 2) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 6) (24, 23) (11, 23) (23, 9) (23, 13) (23, 24) (23, 11) (8, 29) (8, 3) (8, 27) (21, 25) (21, 15) (21, 14) (27, 28) (27, 19) (27, 8) (16, 1) (16, 10) (12, 28) (3, 26) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 22) (7, 13) (7, 17) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 21) (4, 25) (4, 2) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 29, 28)
- Cycle 2: (9, 14, 2, 6)
- Cycle 3: (20, 26, 3, 0)
- Cycle 4: (25, 21, 15, 1)
- Cycle 5: (25, 21, 14, 2)
- Cycle 6: (25, 6, 20, 28)
- Cycle 7: (2, 10, 16, 1)
- Cycle 8: (2, 14, 21, 15)
- Cycle 9: (2, 4, 15, 21)
- Cycle 10: (2, 6, 24, 23)
- Cycle 11: (18, 2, 14, 9)
- Cycle 12: (18, 19, 27, 28)
- Cycle 13: (28, 12, 27, 19)
- Cycle 14: (29, 8, 27, 28)
- Cycle 15: (29, 25, 21, 14)
- Cycle 16: (29, 28, 27, 8)
- Cycle 17: (23, 24, 6, 25)
- Cycle 18: (23, 24, 6, 20)
- Cycle 19: (23, 13, 17, 4)
- Cycle 20: (23, 13, 7, 22)
- Cycle 21: (26, 3, 13, 7)
- Cycle 22: (26, 20, 6, 25)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 6), 28>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <9, (2, 14), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <26, (3, 0), 20>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (15, 21), 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, (14, 21), 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <20, (6, 28), 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <10, (16, 1), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <2, (14, 21), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <2, (15, 21), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <6, (6, 24), 23>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <2, (9, 14), 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <18, (19, 27), 28>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <12, (27, 19), 28>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <8, (27, 28), 29>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <29, (14, 21), 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <27, (8, 28), 29>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <25, (6, 20), 26>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [17]
