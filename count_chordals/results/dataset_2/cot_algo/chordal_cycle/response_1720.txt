Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 5) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 10) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 9) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 2) (18, 3) (18, 8) (3, 18) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 6) (15, 1) (15, 0) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 19) (12, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 6) (10, 14) (10, 2) (5, 16) (5, 4) (13, 16) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle <11, 16, 2, 18, 14> found.
- Cycle <11, 1, 6, 4, 13> found.
- Cycle <16, 13, 4, 7, 9> found.
- Cycle <2, 10, 14, 18, 3> found.
- Cycle <18, 3, 13, 14, 10> found.
- Cycle <1, 6, 0, 15, 1> found.
- Cycle <15, 0, 2, 16, 5> found.
- Cycle <2, 18, 8, 19, 7> found.
- Cycle <18, 14, 10, 2, 16> found.
- Cycle <4, 13, 3, 18, 8> found.
- Cycle <14, 18, 8, 19, 7> found.

Step 2:
- Only the following cycle has exactly one chord:
    + Chordal 4-cycle: <11, 16, 2, 18, 14, (10, 3)>

Step 3:
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.
- Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles is [0].
