Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 5) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 0-1-4-6-0
2. Cycle 1-4-3-7-1
3. Cycle 2-7-12-4-2
4. Cycle 3-4-12-9-3
5. Cycle 5-8-2-13-5
6. Cycle 6-4-12-9-6
7. Cycle 9-12-7-2-9
8. Cycle 10-6-2-7-10
9. Cycle 11-5-8-2-11
10. Cycle 13-6-0-9-13
11. Cycle 14-1-0-5-14

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. For cycle 0-1-4-6-0, no chord can be added.
2. For cycle 1-4-3-7-1, no chord can be added.
3. For cycle 2-7-12-4-2, chord (2, 12) can be added.
4. For cycle 3-4-12-9-3, chord (4, 9) can be added.
5. For cycle 5-8-2-13-5, chord (8, 13) can be added.
6. For cycle 6-4-12-9-6, chord (4, 12) can be added.
7. For cycle 9-12-7-2-9, chord (12, 7) can be added.
8. For cycle 10-6-2-7-10, chord (6, 2) can be added.
9. For cycle 11-5-8-2-11, chord (5, 8) can be added.
10. For cycle 13-6-0-9-13, chord (6, 9) can be added.
11. For cycle 14-1-0-5-14, chord (1, 5) can be added.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [0].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<2, (2, 12)>
<3, (4, 9)>
<5, (8, 13)>
<6, (4, 12)>
<9, (12, 7)>
<10, (6, 2)>
<11, (5, 8)>
<13, (6, 9)>
<14, (1, 5)>
