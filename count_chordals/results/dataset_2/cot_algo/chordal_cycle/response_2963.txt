Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (5, 7) (5, 3) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles present in the graph, but we will focus on those of length 4 or more:
1. Cycle 1: (4, 7, 11, 6)
2. Cycle 2: (4, 7, 5, 3)
3. Cycle 3: (4, 8, 1, 3)
4. Cycle 4: (4, 8, 14, 0)
5. Cycle 5: (4, 6, 9, 1)
6. Cycle 6: (7, 11, 6, 9)
7. Cycle 7: (7, 11, 1, 3)
8. Cycle 8: (7, 11, 10, 6)
9. Cycle 9: (7, 5, 3, 1)
10. Cycle 10: (1, 3, 5, 7)
11. Cycle 11: (1, 3, 12, 8)
12. Cycle 12: (1, 8, 14, 0)
13. Cycle 13: (1, 8, 13, 2)
14. Cycle 14: (3, 5, 7, 4)
15. Cycle 15: (3, 5, 7, 12)
16. Cycle 16: (3, 12, 7, 6)
17. Cycle 17: (8, 13, 2, 1)
18. Cycle 18: (13, 0, 14, 8)
19. Cycle 19: (6, 11, 7, 4)
20. Cycle 20: (6, 11, 10, 6)
21. Cycle 21: (9, 6, 11, 7)
22. Cycle 22: (9, 1, 3, 5)
23. Cycle 23: (10, 6, 4, 7)
24. Cycle 24: (11, 7, 4, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Among these cycles, only one cycle has exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 5, 7> with chord (3, 1) 

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
