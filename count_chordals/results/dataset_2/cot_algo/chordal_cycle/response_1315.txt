- Cycle 11: (7, 4, 2, 3, 16, 10, 15, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 4, 1, 14, 13, 6, 8, 18, 0, 17, 7)
- Cycle 13: (7, 4, 1, 14, 0, 17, 19, 15, 10, 1)
- Cycle 14: (7, 4, 5, 1, 14, 13, 3, 2, 11, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 15, 10, 16, 3, 2, 4, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 15, 19, 17, 0, 18, 8, 6, 13, 14, 1)
- Cycle 17: (10, 15, 7, 4, 2, 3, 16, 10)
- Cycle 18: (10, 16, 3, 17, 0, 18, 8, 6, 13, 14, 1)
- Cycle 19: (17, 3, 2, 4, 7, 15, 10, 16, 3)
- Cycle 20: (17, 0, 18, 8, 6, 13, 14, 1, 4, 7, 15, 17)
- Cycle 21: (19, 7, 4, 2, 3, 16, 10, 15, 19)
- Cycle 22: (19, 7, 15, 10, 16, 3, 17, 0, 14, 1, 5, 19)

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (7, 15), 10, 16>
<1, (7, 19), 17, 0>
<1, (5, 14), 13, 4>
<2, (7, 15), 10, 3>
<2, (7, 19), 17, 0>
<3, (7, 15), 10, 16>
<4, (7, 15), 10, 16>
<7, (1, 14), 13, 4>
<10, (15, 7), 4, 2>
<10, (3, 16), 17, 0>
<14, (1, 5), 7, 19>
<15, (7, 19), 17, 0>
<16, (10, 15), 7, 19>
<17, (0, 18), 8, 6>
<19, (7, 15), 10, 16>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [8].
