Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-1-4-0
- Cycle 2: 1-4-8-7-1
- Cycle 3: 2-9-5-6-2
- Cycle 4: 3-1-2-9-3
- Cycle 5: 4-7-2-9-4
- Cycle 6: 5-9-8-7-5
- Cycle 7: 6-5-9-2-6
- Cycle 8: 7-1-3-0-7
- Cycle 9: 8-4-0-3-8
- Cycle 10: 9-2-7-1-9

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-1-4-0 has chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 2: 1-4-8-7-1 has chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 3: 2-9-5-6-2 has chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 4: 3-1-2-9-3 has chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 5: 4-7-2-9-4 has chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 6: 5-9-8-7-5 has chord (8, 7)
- Cycle 7: 6-5-9-2-6 has chord (5, 2)
- Cycle 8: 7-1-3-0-7 has chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 9: 8-4-0-3-8 has chord (4, 3)
- Cycle 10: 9-2-7-1-9 has chord (7, 2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, (1, 4), 3, 1>
<1, (4, 7), 8, 7>
<2, (5, 6), 9, 2>
<3, (1, 9), 2, 3>
<4, (2, 7), 9, 4>
<5, (8, 7), 9, 5>
<6, (5, 2), 9, 6>
<7, (1, 3), 0, 7>
<8, (4, 3), 0, 8>
<9, (7, 2), 1, 9>
