Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-0-9
- Cycle 2: 1-7-11-6
- Cycle 3: 1-7-11-0
- Cycle 4: 1-12-8-6
- Cycle 5: 1-12-8-13
- Cycle 6: 1-14-2-5
- Cycle 7: 1-14-5-4
- Cycle 8: 3-0-9-10
- Cycle 9: 3-2-5-14
- Cycle 10: 3-2-4-0
- Cycle 11: 3-13-10-9
- Cycle 12: 8-6-11-7
- Cycle 13: 8-13-4-0
- Cycle 14: 5-4-0-9
- Cycle 15: 6-8-12-1
- Cycle 16: 6-8-13-4
- Cycle 17: 6-14-2-1
- Cycle 18: 13-4-0-11
- Cycle 19: 13-10-9-0
- Cycle 20: 11-0-4-5
- Cycle 21: 11-7-1-12

Step 2:
Let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord 3-9
- Cycle 2 has chord 7-11
- Cycle 3 has chord 1-11
- Cycle 4 has chord 12-8
- Cycle 5 has chord 12-8
- Cycle 6 has chord 1-5
- Cycle 7 has chord 1-5
- Cycle 8 has chord 3-9
- Cycle 9 has chord 3-14
- Cycle 10 has chord 2-4
- Cycle 11 has chord 3-9
- Cycle 12 has chord 6-11
- Cycle 13 has chord 13-8
- Cycle 14 has chord 4-9
- Cycle 15 has chord 6-12
- Cycle 16 has chord 8-4
- Cycle 17 has chord 14-2
- Cycle 18 has chord 4-11
- Cycle 19 has chord 13-9
- Cycle 20 has chord 4-5
- Cycle 21 has chord 7-1

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have [21].

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
- <1, (3, 9), 0, 9)>
- <1, 7, (11, 6), 1)>
- <1, (7, 11), 0, 1)>
- <12, (8, 12), 1, 6)>
- <12, (8, 13), 1, 4)>
- <1, (5, 14), 2, 5)>
- <1, 14, (5, 4), 1)>
- <3, 0, (9, 10), 3)>
- <3, 2, (5, 14), 3)>
- <3, (2, 4), 0, 3)>
- <3, (13, 10), 9, 3)>
- <6, 8, (11, 7), 6)>
- <8, 13, (4, 0), 8)>
- <5, 4, 0, (9, 10)>
- <6, 8, 12, (1, 6)>
- <8, 13, 4, (8, 4)>
- <14, 2, 1, (14, 2)>
- <13, 4, 0, (4, 11)>
- <13, (10, 9), 0, 13)>
