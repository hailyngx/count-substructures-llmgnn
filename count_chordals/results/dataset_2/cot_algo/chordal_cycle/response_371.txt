- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 9, 19, 11>, Chord: (9, 19)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <7, 10, 15, 19>, Chord: (10, 15)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <8, 10, 15, 19>, Chord: (15, 19)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <13, 6, 5, 2>, Chord: (6, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <18, 5, 2, 16>, Chord: (2, 16)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <18, 5, 6, 15>, Chord: (5, 15)

- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <19, 11, 9, 4>, Chord: (11, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <19, 11, 9, 3>, Chord: (11, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 20 chordal 4-cycles in total, therefore, the count of chordless cycles is [0].
