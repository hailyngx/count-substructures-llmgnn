Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 9) (15, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (17, 13) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 0) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 16) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 6) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (14, 16) (14, 12) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 0 - 11 - 8 - 12 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 10 - 18 - 16 - 14 - 12 - 8 - 6 - 1 - 7 - 5 - 11 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 11 - 7 - 6 - 8 - 12 - 14 - 16 - 7 - 5 - 13 - 17 - 9 - 4 - 13 - 5 - 19 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 11 - 5 - 7 - 1 - 6 - 8 - 12 - 14 - 16 - 18 - 15 - 9 - 17 - 13 - 5 - 11 - 0
- Cycle 4: 3 - 12 - 14 - 16 - 7 - 5 - 13 - 17 - 9 - 15 - 18 - 10 - 3
- Cycle 5: 0 - 19 - 13 - 17 - 9 - 15 - 18 - 10 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 12 - 14 - 16 - 18 - 15 - 9 - 4 - 13 - 5 - 7 - 6 - 1 - 7 - 11 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (8, 3).
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 13).
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (12, 14).
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (7, 16).
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (3, 12).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 11, 5, 7> with chord (5, 13).
