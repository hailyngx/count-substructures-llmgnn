Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<5, 1, 4, 7>
<9, 0, 4, 7>
<6, 5, 1, 4>
<1, 5, 6, 2>
<3, 1, 5, 2>
<4, 1, 5, 7>
<7, 5, 6, 2>
<8, 6, 5, 1>
<2, 5, 1, 3>
<0, 9, 5, 1>
<4, 0, 9, 5>
<7, 4, 0, 9>
<8, 3, 1, 5>
<3, 4, 1, 5>
<4, 7, 5, 9>
<0, 4, 1, 5>
<6, 7, 5, 1>
<4, 0, 8, 6>
<7, 3, 1, 5>
<8, 0, 4, 1>
<7, 8, 6, 5>
<8, 0, 9, 5>
<3, 8, 6, 5>
<7, 4, 1, 3>
<8, 6, 7, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<5, 1, 4, 7> (Chord: (1, 4))
<9, 0, 4, 7> (Chord: (0, 4))
<6, 5, 1, 4> (Chord: (5, 4))
<1, 5, 6, 2> (Chord: (5, 2))
<3, 1, 5, 2> (Chord: (1, 2))
<4, 1, 5, 7> (Chord: (1, 7))
<7, 5, 6, 2> (Chord: (5, 2))
<8, 6, 5, 1> (Chord: (6, 1))
<2, 5, 1, 3> (Chord: (5, 3))
<0, 9, 5, 1> (Chord: (9, 1))
<4, 0, 9, 5> (Chord: (0, 5))
<7, 4, 0, 9> (Chord: (4, 9))
<8, 3, 1, 5> (Chord: (3, 5))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

[13]

Therefore, there are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
