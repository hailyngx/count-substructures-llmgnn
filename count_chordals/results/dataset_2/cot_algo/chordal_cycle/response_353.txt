Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:   
Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-1-5
- Cycle 3: 5-7-3-5
- Cycle 4: 5-6-4-9-5
- Cycle 5: 5-1-3-5
- Cycle 6: 5-3-7-5
- Cycle 7: 9-4-8-9
- Cycle 8: 9-6-4-9
- Cycle 9: 9-1-5-9
- Cycle 10: 4-9-6-4
- Cycle 11: 4-6-8-4
- Cycle 12: 4-8-2-4
- Cycle 13: 4-2-3-4
- Cycle 14: 7-5-1-7
- Cycle 15: 7-3-2-7
- Cycle 16: 7-1-5-7
- Cycle 17: 1-5-9-1
- Cycle 18: 1-3-5-1
- Cycle 19: 1-9-5-1
- Cycle 20: 3-5-7-3
- Cycle 21: 3-7-5-3
- Cycle 22: 3-1-5-3
- Cycle 23: 6-5-9-6
- Cycle 24: 6-9-5-6
- Cycle 25: 6-4-9-6
- Cycle 26: 6-8-4-6
- Cycle 27: 6-0-2-6
- Cycle 28: 8-4-6-8
- Cycle 29: 8-2-4-8
- Cycle 30: 8-2-3-8
- Cycle 31: 2-4-8-2
- Cycle 32: 2-7-3-2
- Cycle 33: 2-3-4-2
- Cycle 34: 2-8-4-2
- Cycle 35: 2-0-6-2
- Cycle 36: 0-7-3-0
- Cycle 37: 0-6-5-0
- Cycle 38: 0-2-4-0

Step 2:   
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 <5, 9, 4, 6, 5> has a chord (4, 6)  
- Cycle 2 <5, 9, 1, 5> has a chord (9, 1)   
- Cycle 3 <5, 7, 3, 5> has a chord (7, 3)   
- Cycle 4 <5, 6, 4, 9, 5> has a chord (4, 9)   
- Cycle 5 <5, 1, 3, 5> has a chord (1, 3)   
- Cycle 6 <5, 3, 7, 5> has a chord (3, 7)   
- Cycle 7 <9, 4, 8, 9> has a chord (4, 8)   
- Cycle 8 <9, 6, 4, 9> has a chord (6, 4)   
- Cycle 9 <9, 1, 5, 9> has a chord (1, 5)   
- Cycle 10 <4, 9, 6, 4> has a chord (9, 6)   

Step 3:   
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:  
[10]

Therefore, the 10 unique chordal 4-cycles are:  
<5, 9, 4, 6>  
<5, 9, 1, 5>  
<5, 7, 3, 5>  
<5, 6, 4, 9>  
<5, 1, 3, 5>  
<5, 3, 7, 5>  
<9, 4, 8, 9>  
<9, 6, 4, 9>  
<9, 1, 5, 9>  
<4, 9, 6, 4>
