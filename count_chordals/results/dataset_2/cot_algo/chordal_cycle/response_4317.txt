Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 10) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 11) (5, 7) (5, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 6) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (11, 18) (11, 4) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 8) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 8) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 9) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 16) (10, 7) (10, 14) (8, 15) (8, 6) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 2-18-4-13-3-18-2 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 2: 2-18-3-13-4-18-2 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 3: 18-4-13-3-18 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 4: 18-4-11-18 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 5: 18-11-4-18 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 6: 4-13-3-17-4 (chordless cycle)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (18, 4)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (18, 3)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (4, 13)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (4, 11)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (11, 4)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (13, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Uniquely chordal 4-cycles:
- <2, 18, 4, (13, 3)>
- <18, 4, 11, (18, 4)>
