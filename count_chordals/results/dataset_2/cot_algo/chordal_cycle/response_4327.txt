Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-14-5
- Cycle 2: 5-3-1-9-5
- Cycle 3: 5-4-10-12-5
- Cycle 4: 5-14-7-11-5
- Cycle 5: 9-1-3-11-9
- Cycle 6: 6-14-7-11-6
- Cycle 7: 1-3-7-11-1
- Cycle 8: 4-10-12-11-4
- Cycle 9: 9-1-8-13-9
- Cycle 10: 9-0-8-2-9
- Cycle 11: 4-10-12-6-4
- Cycle 12: 1-3-7-14-1
- Cycle 13: 5-9-0-8-5
- Cycle 14: 5-9-1-8-5
- Cycle 15: 6-9-1-13-6
- Cycle 16: 14-7-3-1-14
- Cycle 17: 4-13-8-0-4
- Cycle 18: 5-12-10-4-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: <1, 13>
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <5, 9>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <4, 12>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: <7, 11>
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <3, 9>
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <6, 14>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <1, 11>
- Cycle 8 has a chord: <10, 12>
- Cycle 9 has a chord: <1, 13>
- Cycle 10 has a chord: <0, 8>
- Cycle 11 has a chord: <6, 10>
- Cycle 12 has a chord: <3, 7>
- Cycle 13 has a chord: <8, 9>
- Cycle 14 has a chord: <1, 9>
- Cycle 15 has a chord: <1, 13>
- Cycle 16 has a chord: <3, 14>
- Cycle 17 has a chord: <0, 8>
- Cycle 18 has a chord: <5, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
