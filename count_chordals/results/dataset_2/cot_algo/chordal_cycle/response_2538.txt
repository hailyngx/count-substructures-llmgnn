        - <13, 6, 21, 18> has chord (6, 18)
        - <22, 20, 18, 21> has chord (20, 21)
        - <21, 6, 13, 22> has chord (6, 22)
        - <21, 14, 21, 28> has chord (14, 28)
        - <21, 28, 3, 16> has chord (28, 16)
        - <17, 13, 6, 21> has chord (13, 21)
        - <27, 2, 12, 5> has chord (2, 12)
