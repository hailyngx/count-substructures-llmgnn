Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle: 11-10-0-6-5-13-11
2. Cycle: 11-10-14-9-12-2-6-5-11
3. Cycle: 11-10-0-6-1-5-13-11
4. Cycle: 11-14-9-12-2-6-5-13-11
5. Cycle: 11-0-6-1-5-3-11
6. Cycle: 11-14-10-0-6-2-12-9-11
7. Cycle: 11-14-9-12-8-0-6-2-11
8. Cycle: 11-3-5-1-4-9-12-11
9. Cycle: 11-3-5-13-7-9-12-11
10. Cycle: 11-13-7-8-12-9-4-1-11

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (a non-adjacent edge) are:
1. <1, (4, 9), 2, 6, 5>
2. <1, (4, 2), 12, 9, 11>

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
