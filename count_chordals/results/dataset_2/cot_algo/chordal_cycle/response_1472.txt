Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 2, 5, 6)
- Cycle 2: (1, 7, 8, 11)
- Cycle 3: (2, 3, 5, 6)
- Cycle 4: (2, 7, 8, 12)
- Cycle 5: (2, 1, 6, 10)
- Cycle 6: (2, 1, 7, 8)
- Cycle 7: (3, 4, 9, 13)
- Cycle 8: (3, 5, 6, 10)
- Cycle 9: (3, 12, 7, 8)
- Cycle 10: (4, 9, 11, 1)
- Cycle 11: (4, 9, 13, 0)
- Cycle 12: (4, 3, 5, 14)
- Cycle 13: (5, 6, 10, 2)
- Cycle 14: (5, 8, 7, 1)
- Cycle 15: (6, 10, 2, 1)
- Cycle 16: (6, 14, 5, 8)
- Cycle 17: (7, 8, 11, 1)
- Cycle 18: (9, 11, 1, 7)
- Cycle 19: (9, 13, 0, 4)
- Cycle 20: (12, 3, 5, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (1, 7), 2)>
- <2, (2, 7), 1)>
- <3, (3, 5), 6)>
- <4, (4, 9), 13)>
- <5, (5, 8), 6)>
- <6, (6, 14), 5)>
- <7, (7, 8), 12)>
- <8, (9, 13), 0)>
- <9, (12, 7), 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
