Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 1) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 2) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. (5, 6, 9, 4, 5)
2. (5, 14, 12, 3, 7, 2, 10, 14, 5)
3. (8, 6, 9, 13, 8)
4. (13, 9, 4, 8, 13)
5. (13, 1, 7, 10, 14, 2, 1, 13)
6. (3, 9, 6, 11, 3)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. (5, 6, 9, 4, 5) <(6, 4)>
2. (5, 14, 12, 3, 7, 2, 10, 14, 5) <(7, 10)>
3. (8, 6, 9, 13, 8) <(9, 13)>
4. (13, 9, 4, 8, 13) <(9, 4)>
5. (13, 1, 7, 10, 14, 2, 1, 13) <(7, 1)>
6. (3, 9, 6, 11, 3) <(9, 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
