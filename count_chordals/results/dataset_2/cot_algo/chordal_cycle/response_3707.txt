Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 6) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (3, 5, 9, 4, 3)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 3: (0, 7, 14, 11, 0)
- Cycle 4: (10, 14, 7, 2, 10)
- Cycle 5: (6, 3, 7, 2, 6)
- Cycle 6: (1, 13, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 13, 12, 11, 1)
- Cycle 8: (9, 10, 2, 7, 9)
- Cycle 9: (4, 9, 12, 13, 4)
- Cycle 10: (14, 11, 12, 4, 14)
- Cycle 11: (0, 11, 12, 13, 0)
- Cycle 12: (0, 8, 3, 1, 0)
- Cycle 13: (0, 6, 10, 2, 0)
- Cycle 14: (14, 10, 1, 0, 14)
- Cycle 15: (7, 14, 4, 9, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <1, (2, 4), 5>
- <1, (1, 7), 2>
- <0, (11, 14), 7>
- <10, (7, 2), 14>
- <6, (3, 7), 10>
- <1, (3, 13), 5>
- <1, (1, 12), 3>
- <9, (10, 12), 4>
- <4, (12, 13), 9>
- <11, (4, 14), 12>
- <0, (8, 11), 3>
- <0, (0, 6), 10>
- <10, (1, 14), 0>
- <7, (4, 9), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are a total of [14] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
