Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 11, 0, 8, 1) with edges (11, 1), (1, 0), (0, 8), (8, 1) 
- Cycle 2: (1, 0, 12, 9, 1) with edges (0, 1), (1, 9), (9, 12), (12, 0) 
- Cycle 3: (0, 7, 13, 3, 0) with edges (7, 0), (0, 13), (13, 3), (3, 7)
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 3, 13, 1) with edges (8, 1), (1, 13), (13, 3), (3, 8)
- Cycle 5: (12, 0, 11, 4, 12) with edges (0, 12), (12, 11), (11, 4), (4, 0)
- Cycle 6: (9, 12, 2, 4, 9) with edges (12, 9), (9, 2), (2, 4), (4, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (1, 11, 0, 8, 1) has one chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 2: (1, 0, 12, 9, 1) has one chord (0, 9)
- Cycle 3: (0, 7, 13, 3, 0) has no chord
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 3, 13, 1) has no chord
- Cycle 5: (12, 0, 11, 4, 12) has one chord (0, 4)
- Cycle 6: (9, 12, 2, 4, 9) has one chord (12, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- The chordless cycles are Cycle 3 and Cycle 4.

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 11, 0, 8, 1> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <1, 0, 12, 9, 1> (Chord: (0, 9))
