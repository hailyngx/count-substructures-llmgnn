Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 13) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 11) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 19) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 11) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 15) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 19) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 16) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (16, 18) (16, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 8, 14)
- Cycle 2: (4, 12, 14, 18)
- Cycle 3: (4, 11, 17, 15)
- Cycle 4: (4, 15, 17, 11)
- Cycle 5: (4, 11, 7, 6)
- Cycle 6: (4, 12, 19, 6)
- Cycle 7: (4, 5, 8, 2)
- Cycle 8: (5, 8, 14, 18)
- Cycle 9: (5, 8, 19, 6)
- Cycle 10: (8, 14, 18, 16)
- Cycle 11: (8, 19, 0, 6)
- Cycle 12: (13, 2, 8, 5)
- Cycle 13: (13, 11, 15, 17)
- Cycle 14: (13, 11, 7, 6)
- Cycle 15: (13, 2, 3, 17)
- Cycle 16: (14, 18, 16, 10)
- Cycle 17: (17, 15, 12, 4)
- Cycle 18: (17, 11, 4, 5)
- Cycle 19: (17, 11, 7, 6)
- Cycle 20: (18, 16, 10, 3)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (5, 14)>
- <2, (12, 14)>
- <3, (4, 17)>
- <4, (4, 15)>
- <5, (11, 7)>
- <6, (12, 19)>
- <7, (5, 8)>
- <8, (8, 18)>
- <9, (8, 19)>
- <10, (14, 16)>
- <11, (19, 0)>
- <12, (13, 2)>
- <13, (11, 15)>
- <14, (11, 7)>
- <15, (13, 3)>
- <16, (16, 10)>

Step 3:
There are 16 chordless cycles found.

Thus, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [16].
