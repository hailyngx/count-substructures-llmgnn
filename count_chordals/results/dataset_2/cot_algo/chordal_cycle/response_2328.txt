Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 10) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 6) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 6) (2, 0) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 18) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 19) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 18) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 14) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 11) (18, 13) (18, 1) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 3-5-9-11-3
        - Cycle 2: 3-15-6-14-3
        - Cycle 3: 10-4-10
        - Cycle 4: 10-17-16-10
        - Cycle 5: 16-17-0-19-16
        - Cycle 6: 0-17-10-4-0
        - Cycle 7: 0-12-9-14-13-18-1-16-0
        - Cycle 8: 0-12-11-9-5-3-16-0
        - Cycle 9: 0-6-15-3-11-12-0
        - Cycle 10: 0-19-14-9-5-3-15-0
        - Cycle 11: 0-19-14-6-8-16-1-18-13-12-0

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Checking Cycle 1: 3-5-9-11-3 -> Valid chord (9, 3)
        - Checking Cycle 2: 3-15-6-14-3 -> Valid chord (6, 15)
        - Checking Cycle 3: 10-4-10 -> Not a 4-cycle
        - Checking Cycle 4: 10-17-16-10 -> Not a 4-cycle
        - Checking Cycle 5: 16-17-0-19-16 -> Valid chord (17, 19)
        - Checking Cycle 6: 0-17-10-4-0 -> Valid chord (4, 17)
        - Checking Cycle 7: 0-12-9-14-13-18-1-16-0 -> Not a 4-cycle
        - Checking Cycle 8: 0-12-11-9-5-3-16-0 -> Valid chord (11, 16)
        - Checking Cycle 9: 0-6-15-3-11-12-0 -> Valid chord (15, 11)
        - Checking Cycle 10: 0-19-14-9-5-3-15-0 -> Valid chord (5, 15)
        - Checking Cycle 11: 0-19-14-6-8-16-1-18-13-12-0 -> Not a 4-cycle

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        - <3, (9, 3), 5, 11>
        - <3, (6, 15), 14, 3>
        - <0, (17, 19), 16, 0>
        - <0, (4, 17), 10, 0>
        - <0, (11, 16), 5, 3>
