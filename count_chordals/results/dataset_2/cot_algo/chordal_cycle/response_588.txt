Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 10) (9, 0) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (15, 5) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 13) (7, 17) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 18) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 2) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 12) (18, 8) (18, 10) (19, 7) (19, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 16) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 1) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 6) (12, 1) (12, 6)

- Cycle 10: 2-17-7-4
- Cycle 11: 2-4-11-7
- Cycle 12: 3-10-18-8
- Cycle 13: 3-5-15-16

- Cycle 30: 13-16-15-5
- Cycle 31: 14-3-10-0
- Cycle 32: 14-19-7-4
- Cycle 33: 16-1-6-12
- Cycle 34: 16-6-1-17
- Cycle 35: 17-1-6-12
- Cycle 36: 18-10-0-5
- Cycle 37: 18-8-13-0
- Cycle 38: 19-7-4-11

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: <1, 16, 15, 5> (chord: (1, 16))
- Cycle 2: <2, 17, 7, 4> (chord: (2, 7))
- Cycle 3: <4, 7, 17, 1> (chord: (4, 17))
- Cycle 4: <12, 6, 1, 17> (chord: (12, 1))
- Cycle 5: <0, 10, 18, 8> (chord: (0, 18))
- Cycle 6: <0, 10, 3, 14> (chord: (0, 14))
- Cycle 7: <0, 13, 16, 15> (chord: (0, 16))
- Cycle 8: <3, 10, 18, 8> (chord: (3, 8))
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 13, 16> (chord: (4, 13))
- Cycle 10: <10, 0, 5, 15> (chord: (10, 5))

Step 3:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [10].
