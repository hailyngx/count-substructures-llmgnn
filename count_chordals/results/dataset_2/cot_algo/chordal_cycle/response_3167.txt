Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more are:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 6, 1, 2>
2. Cycle <5, 9, 6, 4, 8>
3. Cycle <5, 9, 2, 1, 6>
4. Cycle <5, 9, 2, 3, 7>
5. Cycle <9, 6, 4, 8, 5>
6. Cycle <9, 6, 1, 2, 5>
7. Cycle <6, 1, 2, 3, 7>
8. Cycle <1, 2, 3, 0, 9>
9. Cycle <3, 2, 8, 4, 6>
10. Cycle <4, 6, 8, 5, 9>
11. Cycle <8, 4, 6, 1, 2>
12. Cycle <2, 1, 6, 9, 5>
13. Cycle <0, 3, 2, 5, 9>
14. Cycle <7, 3, 2, 5, 9>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 6, 1, 2> with chord (1, 6)
2. Cycle <5, 9, 6, 4, 8> with chord (4, 8)
3. Cycle <9, 6, 1, 2, 5> with chord (1, 5)
4. Cycle <9, 6, 4, 8, 5> with chord (4, 5)
5. Cycle <6, 1, 2, 3, 7> with chord (1, 3)
6. Cycle <1, 2, 3, 0, 9> with chord (2, 9)
7. Cycle <3, 2, 8, 4, 6> with chord (8, 4)
8. Cycle <4, 6, 8, 5, 9> with chord (8, 5)

Step 3:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [8].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<5, 9, 6, 1, 2>
<5, 9, 6, 4, 8>
<9, 6, 1, 2, 5>
<9, 6, 4, 8, 5>
<6, 1, 2, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 3, 0, 9>
<3, 2, 8, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 8, 5, 9>
