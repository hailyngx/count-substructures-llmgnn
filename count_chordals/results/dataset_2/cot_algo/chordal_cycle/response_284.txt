Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- Cycle 1: 0-3-14-7-0  
- Cycle 2: 0-3-11-5-0  
- Cycle 3: 0-9-4-8-0  
- Cycle 4: 0-9-10-11-0  
- Cycle 5: 1-7-6-12-1  
- Cycle 6: 1-7-10-1  
- Cycle 7: 2-5-11-13-2  
- Cycle 8: 2-5-4-8-2  
- Cycle 9: 2-7-6-12-2  
- Cycle 10: 3-11-13-5-3  
- Cycle 11: 4-5-2-8-4  
- Cycle 12: 6-7-10-9-6  
- Cycle 13: 6-11-13-0-6  
- Cycle 14: 7-10-9-0-7  
- Cycle 15: 7-14-3-0-7  
- Cycle 16: 8-4-9-10-8  
- Cycle 17: 12-6-11-5-12  
- Cycle 18: 12-1-7-6-12  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:  
- Cycle 1: <0, 14>  
- Cycle 2: <0, 11>  
- Cycle 3: <0, 9>  
- Cycle 5: <1, 7>  
- Cycle 7: <2, 11>  
- Cycle 9: <2, 6>  
- Cycle 10: <3, 5>  
- Cycle 11: <4, 8>  
- Cycle 13: <6, 0>  
- Cycle 14: <7, 10>  
- Cycle 15: <7, 3>  
- Cycle 16: <8, 9>  
- Cycle 17: <11, 5>  
- Cycle 18: <6, 7>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:  
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [14].  
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:  
<0, 14, 3, 7>  
<0, 11, 5, 3>  
<0, 9, 4, 8>  
<1, 7, 6, 12>  
<2, 11, 5, 13>  
<2, 6, 7, 12>  
<3, 5, 11, 13>  
<4, 8, 2, 5>  
<6, 0, 13, 11>  
<7, 10, 9, 0>  
<7, 3, 14, 0>  
<8, 9, 4, 10>  
<11, 5, 13, 2>  
<6, 7, 10, 9>
