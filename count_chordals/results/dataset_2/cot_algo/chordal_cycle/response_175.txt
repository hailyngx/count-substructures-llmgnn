Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
    - Cycle 1: 0-5-8-1-0
    - Cycle 2: 0-1-6-7-0
    - Cycle 3: 0-2-6-7-0
    - Cycle 4: 0-4-7-5-0
    - Cycle 5: 0-5-7-4-0
    - Cycle 6: 0-5-6-1-0
    - Cycle 7: 0-9-4-7-0
    - Cycle 8: 0-9-7-5-0
    - Cycle 9: 0-9-3-1-0
    - Cycle 10: 1-6-7-4-1
    - Cycle 11: 1-8-5-7-1
    - Cycle 12: 2-6-7-4-2
    - Cycle 13: 3-5-7-9-3
    - Cycle 14: 3-9-4-7-3
    - Cycle 15: 4-0-9-3-4
    - Cycle 16: 5-0-1-6-5
    - Cycle 17: 5-3-9-7-5
    - Cycle 18: 5-6-2-0-5
    - Cycle 19: 5-7-4-0-5
    - Cycle 20: 6-1-8-5-6
    - Cycle 21: 6-2-7-4-6
    - Cycle 22: 6-5-0-1-6
    - Cycle 23: 7-0-5-8-7
    - Cycle 24: 7-4-9-0-7
    - Cycle 25: 7-5-6-2-7
    - Cycle 26: 7-6-1-0-7
    - Cycle 27: 8-0-5-1-8
    - Cycle 28: 9-3-1-0-9
    - Cycle 29: 9-4-7-5-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - The cycle 0-1-6-7-0 has one chord (1, 6).
    - The cycle 6-1-8-5-6 has one chord (1, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
    There are no chordless cycles.

Final answer: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
    1. <0, 1, 6, 7, (1, 6)>
    2. <6, 1, 8, 5, (1, 8)>
