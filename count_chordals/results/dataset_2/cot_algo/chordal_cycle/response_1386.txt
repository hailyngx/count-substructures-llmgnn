Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 16) (15, 13) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (18, 16) (18, 17) (16, 15) (16, 18) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (19, 7) (19, 0) (9, 0) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 9) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 14, 10, 11, 2, 7, 4, 13, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 12, 2, 11, 10, 14, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 13, 4, 7, 2, 12, 5, 0, 9>
- Cycle 4: <1, 13, 4, 7, 19, 0, 5, 12, 2>
- Cycle 5: <1, 13, 4, 12, 17, 18, 16, 15>
- Cycle 6: <2, 7, 4, 13, 15, 16, 18, 17, 12>
- Cycle 7: <2, 7, 4, 12, 17, 18, 16, 15>
- Cycle 8: <4, 13, 15, 16, 18, 17, 12, 2>
- Cycle 9: <7, 4, 13, 15, 16, 18, 17, 12>
- Cycle 10: <10, 11, 2, 7, 4, 13, 15, 16>
- Cycle 11: <10, 11, 2, 12, 17, 18, 16, 15>
- Cycle 12: <12, 17, 18, 16, 15, 13, 1, 0>
- Cycle 13: <14, 10, 11, 2, 12, 17, 18, 16>
- Cycle 14: <15, 13, 4, 7, 2, 12, 17, 18>
- Cycle 15: <16, 18, 17, 12, 2, 7, 4, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (13), 4, 7, 2, (12), 5> (Chords: 13 and 12)
- <1, (13), 4, 7, 19, 0, 5, (12), 2> (Chords: 13 and 12)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 13 chordless cycles in the given graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [13].
