Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
1. Cycle 1: 5 - 6 - 2 - 9 - 8 - 5
2. Cycle 2: 5 - 1 - 4 - 9 - 8 - 5
3. Cycle 3: 5 - 1 - 8 - 2 - 6 - 5
4. Cycle 4: 5 - 3 - 6 - 2 - 8 - 5
5. Cycle 5: 5 - 3 - 0 - 9 - 8 - 5
6. Cycle 6: 5 - 3 - 8 - 2 - 6 - 5
7. Cycle 7: 5 - 6 - 3 - 0 - 9 - 5
8. Cycle 8: 5 - 6 - 2 - 8 - 3 - 5
9. Cycle 9: 5 - 1 - 8 - 8 - 3 - 5
10. Cycle 10: 5 - 1 - 4 - 0 - 9 - 5
11. Cycle 11: 6 - 7 - 0 - 3 - 5 - 6
12. Cycle 12: 6 - 7 - 0 - 9 - 8 - 6
13. Cycle 13: 6 - 2 - 9 - 0 - 7 - 6

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (2, 8).
- Cycle 2 has chord (1, 4).
- Cycle 3 has chord (1, 8).
- Cycle 5 has chord (0, 9).
- Cycle 6 has chord (3, 8).
- Cycle 7 has chord (6, 3).
- Cycle 8 has chord (2, 8).
- Cycle 10 has chord (1, 4).
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of [8] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (2, 8), 4>
2. <2, (1, 4), 8>
3. <3, (1, 8), 5>
4. <5, (0, 9), 3>
5. <6, (3, 8), 2>
6. <7, (6, 3), 0>
7. <8, (2, 8), 6>
8. <10, (1, 4), 0>
