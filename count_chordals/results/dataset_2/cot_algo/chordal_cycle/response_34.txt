Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 14) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 3) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 10) (4, 22) (8, 9) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 11) (15, 20) (15, 7) (15, 13) (18, 6) (1, 20) (1, 26) (1, 13) (1, 22) (26, 1) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (5, 25) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 29) (19, 25) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 16) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 13) (29, 23) (28, 8) (28, 12) (22, 4) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 24) (22, 21) (10, 25) (12, 0) (12, 28) (12, 16) (16, 19) (16, 22) (16, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 29) (13, 21) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 22) (21, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (24, 22) (24, 23) (23, 25) (23, 29) (23, 24) (17, 7) (17, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 7, 15, 20, 1, 26) 
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 8, 14, 6) 
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 8, 11, 3, 14, 9) 
- Cycle 4: (9, 29, 5, 25, 20, 15, 7, 0) 
- Cycle 5: (20, 15, 7, 0, 12, 28, 8, 9, 6, 2) 
- Cycle 6: (25, 20, 15, 7, 0, 12, 28, 8, 9, 6, 2, 5) 
- Cycle 7: (8, 9, 29, 5, 25, 20, 1, 26, 22, 4) 
- Cycle 8: (15, 20, 25, 19, 16, 22, 21, 13, 29, 5) 

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords.
- Cycle 2 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 3 has 2 chords.
- Cycle 4 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 5 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 6 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord.
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <6, 9, 8, 14>
- <9, 29, 5, 25>
- <20, 15, 7, 0>
