Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: 0-14-1-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-2-7-4-0
- Cycle 3: 8-7-4-12-8
- Cycle 4: 8-12-10-9-8
- Cycle 5: 14-11-10-8-14
- Cycle 6: 11-10-9-5-11
- Cycle 7: 6-2-7-4-6
- Cycle 8: 6-8-10-12-6 
- Cycle 9: 6-8-3-5-6 
- Cycle 10: 6-8-10-9-6
- Cycle 11: 9-10-11-14-9
- Cycle 12: 1-4-7-2-1
- Cycle 13: 1-4-12-10-1
- Cycle 14: 3-5-9-10-3
- Cycle 15: 3-5-13-1-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: 14-4
- Cycle 2 has a chord: 2-7
- Cycle 3 has a chord: 4-12
- Cycle 4 has a chord: 10-9
- Cycle 5 has a chord: 10-8
- Cycle 6 has a chord: 10-9
- Cycle 7 has a chord: 2-7
- Cycle 8 has a chord: 8-10
- Cycle 9 has a chord: 5-6
- Cycle 10 has a chord: 9-10
- Cycle 11 has a chord: 9-10
- Cycle 12 has a chord: 4-7
- Cycle 13 has a chord: 5-13
- Cycle 14 has a chord: 9-10
- Cycle 15 has a chord: 5-13

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 15 cycles with exactly one chord, so the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [15].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 14, 1, 4> with a chord (14, 4)
<0, 2, 7, 4> with a chord (2, 7)
<8, 7, 4, 12> with a chord (4, 12)
<8, 12, 10, 9> with a chord (10, 9)
<14, 11, 10, 8> with a chord (10, 8)
<6, 2, 7, 4> with a chord (2, 7)
<6, 8, 10, 12> with a chord (10, 12)
<6, 8, 3, 5> with a chord (5, 6)
<11, 10, 9, 5> with a chord (9, 10)
<1, 4, 7, 2> with a chord (4, 7)
<3, 5, 9, 10> with a chord (9, 10)
<5, 13, 9, 10> with a chord (9, 10)
<3, 5, 13, 1> with a chord (5, 13)
