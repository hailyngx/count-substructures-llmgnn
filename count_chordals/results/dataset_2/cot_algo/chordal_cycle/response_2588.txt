Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Potential cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-9-12-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-7-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-2-12-1
- Cycle 4: 1-4-8-3-1
- Cycle 5: 5-6-8-3-5
- Cycle 6: 5-6-14-0-5
- Cycle 7: 5-6-8-4-5
- Cycle 8: 5-8-6-14-5
- Cycle 9: 7-3-1-4-7
- Cycle 10: 7-3-8-5-7
- Cycle 11: 7-11-6-13-7
- Cycle 12: 9-10-14-0-9
- Cycle 13: 9-12-2-4-9
- Cycle 14: 10-9-12-2-10
- Cycle 15: 10-14-6-11-10
- Cycle 16: 13-6-8-4-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, Cycle 5, Cycle 6, Cycle 9, Cycle 10, Cycle 11, Cycle 12, Cycle 14, and Cycle 15 have no chord.
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (3, 1)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (8, 3)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (6, 14)
- Cycle 13 has one chord: (12, 2)
- Cycle 16 has one chord: (6, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 11 chordless cycles which are: <1, 3, 9, 12>, <1, 4, 2, 12>, <1, 4, 8, 3>, <5, 6, 8, 3, 5>, <5, 6, 14, 0, 5>, <7, 3, 1, 4, 7>, <7, 3, 8, 5, 7>, <7, 11, 6, 13, 7>, <9, 10, 14, 0, 9>, <10, 14, 6, 11, 10>, <10, 12, 2, 4, 9>.
So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
