Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - (1, 3, 6, 4, 1)
        - (1, 9, 13, 0, 1)
        - (2, 4, 13, 9, 2)
        - (5, 6, 11, 2, 5)
        - (5, 10, 12, 1, 5)
        - (6, 3, 8, 5, 6)
        - (7, 0, 10, 14, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle (1, 3, 6, 4, 1) has a chord (3, 6)
        - Cycle (1, 9, 13, 0, 1) has a chord (9, 0)
        - Cycle (2, 4, 13, 9, 2) has a chord (4, 9)
        - Cycle (5, 6, 11, 2, 5) has a chord (6, 11)
        - Cycle (5, 10, 12, 1, 5) has a chord (10, 12)
        - Cycle (6, 3, 8, 5, 6) has a chord (3, 8)
        - Cycle (7, 0, 10, 14, 7) has a chord (0, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

List of unique chordal 4-cycle:
        - <1, 3, 6, 4> with chord (3, 6)
        - <1, 9, 13, 0> with chord (9, 0)
        - <2, 4, 13, 9> with chord (4, 9)
        - <5, 6, 11, 2> with chord (6, 11)
        - <5, 10, 12, 1> with chord (10, 12)
        - <6, 3, 8, 5> with chord (3, 8)
        - <7, 0, 10, 14> with chord (0, 14)
