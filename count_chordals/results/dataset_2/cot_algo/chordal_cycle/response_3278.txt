Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 8) (9, 11) (26, 9) (26, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (22, 8) (23, 21) (23, 6) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 24) (15, 25) (15, 12) (15, 28) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 28) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 21) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 1) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 19) (13, 26) (13, 0) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 16) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 3) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 20) (8, 21) (16, 1) (16, 28) (16, 27) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 2) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 27) (4, 21) (27, 10) (27, 16) (27, 19) (27, 24) (29, 7) (29, 6) (29, 24) (11, 9) (11, 18) (6, 23) (6, 29) (6, 25) (6, 2) (24, 17) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 21) (3, 5) (3, 20) (3, 18) (3, 19) (25, 15) (25, 6) (25, 2) (2, 10) (2, 28) (2, 6) (2, 25) (21, 23) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 4) (21, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<1, 17, 24, 27>
<1, 17, 24, 29>
<1, 16, 27, 10>
<1, 16, 27, 19>
<1, 7, 12, 15>
<1, 7, 5, 3>
<2, 10, 18, 3>
<2, 10, 18, 11>
<2, 25, 6, 23>
<2, 25, 15, 12>
<3, 18, 10, 27>
<3, 18, 10, 2>
<3, 19, 27, 24>
<3, 19, 12, 15>
<3, 20, 8, 22>
<3, 20, 28, 15>
<4, 21, 14, 0>
<4, 21, 24, 27>
<5, 7, 0, 14>
<5, 7, 12, 15>
<6, 23, 21, 14>
<6, 23, 21, 8>
<6, 25, 15, 12>
<6, 25, 2, 10>
<6, 29, 24, 21>
<7, 1, 17, 24>
<8, 22, 8, 20>
<9, 26, 13, 0>
<9, 26, 13, 7>
<10, 18, 11, 9>
<11, 18, 10, 2>
<12, 15, 28, 16>
<13, 26, 9, 11>
<14, 21, 23, 6>
<19, 27, 24, 21>
<20, 8, 21, 4>
<20, 8, 22, 3>
<21, 24, 27, 16>
<24, 29, 7, 1>
<25, 15, 28, 16>
<26, 13, 0, 14>
<29, 7, 1, 17>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<1, 17, 24, 27> (chord: 24-17)
<1, 17, 24, 29> (chord: 17-29)
<2, 10, 18, 11> (chord: 10-18)
<2, 25, 6, 23> (chord: 6-25)
<3, 18, 10, 27> (chord: 18-10)
<3, 19, 27, 24> (chord: 27-19)
<3, 20, 8, 22> (chord: 8-20)
<6, 23, 21, 14> (chord: 21-23)
<6, 25, 15, 12> (chord: 15-25)
<7, 1, 17, 24> (chord: 17-1)
<9, 26, 13, 0> (chord: 13-26)
<12, 15, 28, 16> (chord: 28-15)
<13, 26, 9, 11> (chord: 9-26)
<14, 21, 23, 6> (chord: 23-21)
<20, 8, 21, 4> (chord: 8-21)
<24, 29, 7, 1> (chord: 7-29)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
