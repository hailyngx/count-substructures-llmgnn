Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 15) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 13) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 6) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 6) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 18) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 13) (6, 15) (6, 16) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 14) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 0) (13, 19) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (10, 11, 15, 7)
- Cycle 2: (10, 17, 8, 7)
- Cycle 3: (10, 14, 8, 12)
- Cycle 4: (11, 15, 16, 2)
- Cycle 5: (17, 8, 12, 3)
- Cycle 6: (17, 18, 19, 4)
- Cycle 7: (7, 8, 12, 3)
- Cycle 8: (12, 8, 14, 10)
- Cycle 9: (5, 2, 16, 6)
- Cycle 10: (5, 4, 0, 18)
- Cycle 11: (5, 0, 9, 2)
- Cycle 12: (19, 18, 0, 5)
- Cycle 13: (19, 4, 0, 18)
- Cycle 14: (15, 16, 2, 9)
- Cycle 15: (15, 7, 8, 17)
- Cycle 16: (16, 2, 9, 12)
- Cycle 17: (16, 6, 15, 11)
- Cycle 18: (18, 19, 13, 2)
- Cycle 19: (18, 0, 5, 2)
- Cycle 20: (18, 3, 12, 9)
- Cycle 21: (14, 8, 17, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (15, 7), 11>
- <2, (17, 8), 10>
- <3, (10, 14), 8>
- <4, (2, 16), 15>
- <5, (17, 18), 8>
- <6, (19, 4), 18>
- <7, (7, 8), 12>
- <8, (10, 14), 8>
- <9, (5, 2), 16>
- <10, (0, 18), 5>
- <11, (5, 0), 9>
- <12, (19, 18), 5>
- <13, (19, 4), 0>
- <14, (9, 12), 8>
- <15, (15, 7), 17>
- <16, (2, 9), 16>
- <17, (11, 15), 16>
- <18, (18, 19), 13>
- <19, (18, 0), 5>
- <20, (9, 12), 3>
- <21, (10, 14), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 21 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [21].
