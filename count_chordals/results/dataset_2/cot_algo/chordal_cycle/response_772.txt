Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 23) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 25) (4, 26) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 9) (20, 11) (20, 29) (20, 12) (25, 4) (25, 15) (25, 21) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 14) (6, 22) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 24) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (21, 11) (21, 25) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 13) (28, 10) (22, 6) (22, 26) (22, 10) (22, 17) (26, 11) (26, 4) (26, 22) (26, 10) (17, 22) (17, 29) (17, 18) (29, 20) (29, 17) (29, 1) (13, 5) (13, 28) (19, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 27) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 26) (15, 7) (15, 25) (15, 0) (12, 20) (12, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 18) (24, 2) (24, 27) (14, 6) (14, 3) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 23) (23, 16) (23, 18) (27, 9) (27, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 13, 28, 21, 11, 20)
- Cycle 2: (2, 8, 1, 5, 13, 28, 21)
- Cycle 3: (2, 8, 1, 9, 7, 16, 11)
- Cycle 4: (2, 8, 1, 9, 7, 4, 25)
- Cycle 5: (2, 24, 27, 9, 7, 4, 26)
- Cycle 6: (3, 0, 2, 8, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 7: (3, 14, 6, 22, 26, 11, 20)
- Cycle 8: (4, 7, 16, 23, 18, 0, 2)
- Cycle 9: (4, 7, 9, 1, 5, 13, 28)
- Cycle 10: (4, 25, 15, 7, 16, 23, 18)
- Cycle 11: (5, 13, 28, 21, 25, 4, 26)
- Cycle 12: (6, 14, 3, 0, 2, 8, 1)
- Cycle 13: (6, 22, 26, 4, 19, 7, 9)
- Cycle 14: (11, 16, 7, 9, 27, 24, 2)
- Cycle 15: (11, 16, 7, 9, 27, 24, 27)
- Cycle 16: (16, 7, 4, 19, 29, 17, 18)
- Cycle 17: (18, 17, 29, 20, 11, 26, 22)
- Cycle 18: (18, 23, 16, 7, 9, 27, 24)
- Cycle 19: (20, 11, 26, 22, 10, 28, 21)
- Cycle 20: (22, 26, 4, 19, 29, 1, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <1, (11, 21), 6>
- <2, (8, 1), 4>
- <4, (7, 16), 10>
- <5, (13, 28), 11>
- <6, (14, 3), 12>
- <7, (9, 1), 9>
- <8, (1, 5), 3>
- <9, (9, 27), 2>
- <11, (16, 7), 1>
- <13, (28, 21), 5>
- <15, (7, 16), 4>
- <17, (29, 1), 20>
- <18, (23, 16), 16>
- <20, (11, 26), 19>
- <22, (26, 4), 20>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the answer is [15].
