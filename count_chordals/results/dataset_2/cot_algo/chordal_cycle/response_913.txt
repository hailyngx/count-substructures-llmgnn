Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 9) (1, 12) (1, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 13) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        <0, 11, 14, 3>
        <0, 11, 13, 4>
        <0, 6, 5, 8>
        <0, 6, 4, 1>
        <0, 6, 8, 2>
        <0, 6, 8, 12>
        <0, 11, 7, 10>
        <1, 4, 6, 8>
        <1, 12, 8, 6>
        <2, 8, 5, 12>
        <2, 8, 12, 1>
        <3, 14, 11, 13>
        <4, 6, 0, 11>
        <4, 6, 8, 5>
        <4, 6, 8, 12>
        <4, 1, 12, 5>
        <4, 1, 12, 3>
        <4, 1, 12, 9>
        <4, 1, 12, 2>
        <4, 3, 14, 11>
        <4, 3, 12, 1>
        <4, 3, 12, 9>
        <4, 9, 12, 1>
        <5, 6, 8, 12>
        <5, 8, 12, 1>
        <5, 8, 12, 3>
        <6, 4, 1, 12>
        <6, 4, 3, 12>
        <6, 8, 2, 12>
        <7, 9, 14, 11>
        <9, 12, 8, 6>
        <9, 12, 1, 4>
        <9, 12, 4, 6>
        <9, 12, 4, 1>
        <9, 12, 5, 8>
        <9, 14, 11, 10>
        <10, 11, 14, 3>
        <10, 11, 13, 4>
        <10, 11, 7, 9>
        <11, 13, 4, 6>
        <11, 13, 4, 1>
        <11, 13, 14, 3>
        <13, 11, 10, 9>
        <14, 11, 13, 4>
        <14, 11, 7, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        <0, 6, 5, 8>  (Chord: 6 - 8)
        <1, 4, 6, 8>  (Chord: 4 - 8)
        <2, 8, 5, 12>  (Chord: 5 - 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

        There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [3].
