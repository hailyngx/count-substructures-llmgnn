Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 9 - 4 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 9 - 2 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 2 - 1 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 2 - 6 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 5: 1 - 4 - 9 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 4 - 6 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 7: 2 - 5 - 7 - 8 - 2
- Cycle 8: 3 - 9 - 2 - 6 - 3
- Cycle 9: 4 - 6 - 3 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 10: 5 - 2 - 9 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 11: 5 - 7 - 0 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 12: 7 - 8 - 1 - 0 - 7

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord (connecting non-adjacent nodes) are:
- <0, (1, 4), 9>
- <0, (2, 6), 9>
- <1, (2, 6), 4>
- <2, (5, 7), 8>

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found. 
Therefore, the final count is [4].
