Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-11-10-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-12-7-6
- Cycle 3: 6-12-8-9-6
- Cycle 4: 6-10-11-9-6
- Cycle 5: 9-8-12-6-9
- Cycle 6: 9-11-10-6-9
- Cycle 7: 10-6-12-9-10
- Cycle 8: 10-11-9-6-10
- Cycle 9: 12-6-9-11-12
- Cycle 10: 12-7-5-13-2-12
- Cycle 11: 12-8-1-7-12
- Cycle 12: 11-9-6-10-11
- Cycle 13: 11-10-3-5-11
- Cycle 14: 7-12-6-9-7

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 10 (<12, 7, (5, 13)>)
- Cycle 11 (<12, 8, (1, 7)>)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]
