Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 11, 0> with chord (5, 11)
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 13, 4, 0> with chord (5, 4)
- Cycle 3: <0, 2, 4, 0> with chord (2, 4)
- Cycle 4: <0, 10, 14, 9, 4, 0> with chord (10, 9)
- Cycle 5: <0, 11, 6, 8, 14, 10, 0> with chord (11, 8)
- Cycle 6: <0, 4, 9, 7, 10, 0> with chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 7: <0, 10, 3, 12, 2, 0> with chord (10, 12)
- Cycle 8: <1, 0, 5, 13, 3, 1> with chord (0, 13)
- Cycle 9: <1, 0, 2, 12, 3, 1> with chord (0, 12)
- Cycle 10: <1, 3, 13, 8, 14, 9, 1> with chord (3, 8)
- Cycle 11: <2, 0, 5, 13, 3, 2> with chord (0, 13)
- Cycle 12: <2, 0, 4, 9, 14, 8, 2> with chord (0, 9)
- Cycle 13: <2, 12, 3, 13, 8, 2> with chord (12, 8)
- Cycle 14: <3, 1, 0, 5, 13, 8, 3> with chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 15: <3, 10, 0, 2, 12, 3> with chord (10, 2)
  
Step 2: 
Chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord):
- <0, 5, 11, 0> with chord (5, 11)
- <0, 2, 4, 0> with chord (2, 4)
- <0, 10, 14, 9, 4, 0> with chord (10, 9)
- <0, 11, 6, 8, 14, 10, 0> with chord (11, 8)
- <0, 4, 9, 7, 10, 0> with chord (4, 7)
- <0, 10, 3, 12, 2, 0> with chord (10, 12)
- <1, 0, 5, 13, 3, 1> with chord (0, 13)
- <1, 3, 13, 8, 14, 9, 1> with chord (3, 8)
- <2, 0, 5, 13, 3, 2> with chord (0, 13)
- <2, 0, 4, 9, 14, 8, 2> with chord (0, 9)
- <2, 12, 3, 13, 8, 2> with chord (12, 8)
- <3, 1, 0, 5, 13, 8, 3> with chord (1, 8)
- <3, 10, 0, 2, 12, 3> with chord (10, 2)

Step 3:
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [13].
