Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 9) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (7, 19) (13, 17) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 15) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 0) (0, 19) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 12) (2, 17) (2, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 18) (5, 14) (5, 18) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 11 - 6 - 16 - 1 - 11
- Cycle 2: 11 - 15 - 6 - 11
- Cycle 3: 16 - 8 - 17 - 14 - 16
- Cycle 4: 16 - 6 - 14 - 17 - 16
- Cycle 5: 14 - 5 - 18 - 12 - 14

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1: <1, (6, 16), 11>
- Cycle 2: <15, (6, 11), 11>
- Cycle 3: <8, (16, 14), 17>
- Cycle 4: <6, (14, 17), 16>
- Cycle 5: No chord in this cycle

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (6, 16), 11>
- <15, (6, 11), 11>
- <8, (16, 14), 17>
- <6, (14, 17), 16>
