Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-1-5 
- Cycle 2: 5-9-3-1-5 
- Cycle 3: 5-2-7-1-5 
- Cycle 4: 5-0-7-1-5 
- Cycle 5: 5-0-2-7-5 
- Cycle 6: 9-8-2-5-9 
- Cycle 7: 9-8-2-0-9 
- Cycle 8: 9-6-4-7-9 
- Cycle 9: 9-6-4-3-9 
- Cycle 10: 4-3-7-0-4 
- Cycle 11: 4-7-1-6-4 
- Cycle 12: 4-7-9-5-4 
- Cycle 13: 4-6-1-3-4 
- Cycle 14: 7-2-5-0-7 
- Cycle 15: 7-3-1-6-7 
- Cycle 16: 7-3-1-0-7 
- Cycle 17: 7-3-4-6-7 

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
- Cycle 1: <5, (9, 6), 1, 5> 
- Cycle 2: <5, (9, 3), 1, 5> 
- Cycle 3: <5, (2, 7), 1, 5> 
- Cycle 4: <5, (0, 7), 1, 5> 
- Cycle 5: <5, (0, 2), 7, 5> 
- Cycle 6: <9, (8, 2), 5, 9> 
- Cycle 7: <9, (8, 2), 0, 9> 
- Cycle 8: <9, (6, 4), 7, 9> 
- Cycle 9: <9, (6, 4), 3, 9> 
- Cycle 10: <4, (3, 7), 0, 4> 
- Cycle 11: <4, (7, 1), 6, 4> 
- Cycle 12: <4, (7, 9), 5, 4> 
- Cycle 13: <4, (6, 1), 3, 4> 
- Cycle 14: <7, (2, 5), 0, 7> 
- Cycle 15: <7, (3, 1), 6, 7> 
- Cycle 16: <7, (3, 1), 0, 7> 
- Cycle 17: <7, (3, 4), 6, 7> 

Step 3: 
There are 17 unique chordal 4-cycles found. 
So, the final count is [17].
