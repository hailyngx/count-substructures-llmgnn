Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 17) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 8) (10, 17) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 3) (11, 19) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 5) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 9) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 2) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 14) (2, 14) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
<ul>
<li> Cycle 1: (3, 15, 17, 1, 13, 6, 0, 3) </li>
<li> Cycle 2: (3, 4, 7, 8, 14, 2, 13, 1, 17, 15, 3) </li>
<li> Cycle 3: (3, 4, 16, 18, 9, 0, 6, 13, 1, 12, 3) </li>
<li> Cycle 4: (3, 11, 19, 5, 4, 16, 8, 14, 1, 17, 15, 13, 6, 0, 3) </li>
</ul>

Step 2: 
<ul>
<li> <3, (1, 13), 6, (0, 3)> </li>
<li> <3, (4, 16), 8, (13, 1)> </li>
</ul>

Step 3: 
As we found 2 chordal 4-cycles, the final answer is [2].
