Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, we cannot proceed with finding any chordal 4-cycles.

Step 3:
- The final count of chordal 4-cycles is [0].
