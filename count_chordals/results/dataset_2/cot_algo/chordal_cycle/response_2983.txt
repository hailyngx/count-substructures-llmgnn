Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 8) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 5-7-4-6-5
        - Cycle 2: 8-4-6-5-8
        - Cycle 3: 3-6-5-13-3
        - Cycle 4: 1-7-4-8-1
        - Cycle 5: 3-9-0-4-3
        - Cycle 6: 10-11-2-1-10
        - Cycle 7: 12-6-5-2-12
        - Cycle 8: 14-7-1-12-14
        - Cycle 9: 9-14-7-5-9
        - Cycle 10: 11-10-1-14-11
        - Cycle 11: 13-8-2-11-13
        - Cycle 12: 13-5-12-1-13
        - Cycle 13: 0-4-6-3-0
        - Cycle 14: 2-11-13-3-2
        - Cycle 15: 8-13-3-9-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <5, (7, 4), 6, (4, 6)>
        - <8, (4, 6), 5, (6, 8)>
        - <3, (6, 5), 13, (5, 3)>
        - <1, (7, 4), 8, (4, 8)>
        - <3, (9, 0), 4, (0, 3)>
        - <10, (11, 2), 1, (2, 10)>
        - <12, (6, 5), 2, (5, 12)>
        - <14, (7, 1), 12, (1, 14)>
        - <9, (14, 7), 5, (7, 9)>
        - <11, (10, 1), 14, (1, 11)>
        - <13, (8, 2), 11, (2, 13)>
        - <13, (5, 12), 1, (12, 13)>
        - <4, (6, 3), 0, (3, 4)>
        - <2, (11, 13), 3, (13, 2)>
        - <8, (13, 3), 9, (3, 8)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 15 chordal 4-cycles.
        
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [15].
