Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (14, 12) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Possible cycles in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 6, 12>
2. <0, 3, 7, 12>
3. <0, 3, 2, 8>
4. <0, 11, 1, 9>
5. <0, 11, 8, 12>
6. <0, 13, 5, 4>
7. <1, 2, 3, 7>
8. <1, 2, 5, 4>
9. <1, 5, 13, 9>
10. <2, 3, 6, 12>
11. <2, 5, 13, 0>
12. <3, 6, 12, 7>
13. <4, 5, 13, 6>
14. <6, 10, 11, 1>
15. <6, 10, 4, 5>
16. <6, 12, 3, 0>
17. <7, 12, 3, 0>
18. <10, 4, 5, 13>
19. <11, 1, 5, 13>
20. <13, 0, 3, 12>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <0, 3, 6, 12> has chord (0, 6)
2. <0, 11, 1, 9> has chord (1, 11)
3. <1, 2, 3, 7> has chord (2, 7)
4. <1, 5, 13, 9> has chord (5, 9)
5. <2, 3, 6, 12> has chord (3, 6)
6. <4, 5, 13, 6> has chord (5, 6)
7. <6, 10, 11, 1> has chord (10, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Final number of chordal 4-cycles: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, 3, 6, 12>
<0, 11, 1, 9>
<1, 2, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 13, 9>
<2, 3, 6, 12>
<4, 5, 13, 6>
<6, 10, 11, 1>
