        - <6, 10, 3, 14>
        - <6, 8, 3, 14>
        - <6, 8, 0, 13>
        - <0, 8, 3, 14>
        - <0, 13, 14, 1>
        - <14, 3, 11, 9>
        - <14, 3, 10, 2>
        - <13, 5, 8, 6>
        - <13, 5, 10, 2>
        - <13, 11, 9, 4>
        - <13, 11, 3, 8>
        - <13, 0, 6, 8>
        - <13, 0, 8, 5>
        - <3, 14, 13, 11>
        - <3, 14, 1, 7>
        - <3, 11, 9, 4>
        - <3, 11, 1, 7>
        - <3, 10, 2, 5>
        - <3, 10, 6, 8>
        - <11, 9, 4, 7>
        - <11, 13, 0, 6>
        - <11, 13, 14, 1>
        - <11, 3, 8, 5>
        - <8, 5, 10, 2>
        - <8, 5, 13, 0>
        - <8, 6, 10, 3>
        - <8, 6, 0, 13>
        - <8, 0, 13, 14>
        - <12, 3, 14, 1>
        - <12, 11, 9, 4>
        - <2, 5, 13, 0>
        - <2, 5, 10, 6>
        - <2, 10, 3, 14>
        - <1, 4, 9, 7>
        - <1, 4, 7, 9>
        - <1, 14, 3, 11>
        - <1, 14, 13, 0>
        - <1, 11, 9, 4>
        - <1, 11, 3, 8>
        - <1, 12, 3, 14>
        - <1, 12, 11, 9>
        - <10, 5, 13, 0>
        - <10, 5, 2, 9>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <5, 9, 4, 7> - has exactly one chord (5, 4)
        - <5, 2, 9, 11> - has exactly one chord (5, 9)
        - <5, 8, 9, 4> - has exactly one chord (5, 9)
        - <5, 9, 11, 13> - has exactly one chord (5, 13)
        - <5, 10, 6, 8> - has exactly one chord (5, 6)
        - <5, 8, 3, 10> - has exactly one chord (5, 10)
        - <5, 8, 0, 6> - has exactly one chord (5, 6)
        - <9, 4, 7, 1> - has exactly one chord (9, 4)
        - <14, 3, 11, 9> - has exactly one chord (3, 14)
        - <1, 14, 3, 11> - has exactly one chord (3, 14)
        - <1, 12, 3, 14> - has exactly one chord (3, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are a total of [7] chordless cycles in the graph.
