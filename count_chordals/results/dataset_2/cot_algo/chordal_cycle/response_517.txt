Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1:  
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:  
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal cycles to consider.

Step 3:  
- The number of chordless cycles found is 0.

Therefore, the final count of the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
