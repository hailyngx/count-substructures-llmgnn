Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 12) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 10) (1, 13) (15, 14) (15, 4) (15, 5) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 1) (16, 0) (16, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 19) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 5) (6, 18) (6, 16) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 10) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. (14, 17, 13, 1) 
2. (14, 17, 19, 9) 
3. (14, 0, 12, 8) 
4. (14, 13, 1, 15) 
5. (17, 14, 15, 4) 
6. (17, 13, 1, 15) 
7. (17, 19, 9, 2) 
8. (2, 11, 8, 12) 
9. (2, 9, 19, 17) 
10. (18, 4, 15, 5) 
11. (18, 7, 0, 12) 
12. (18, 12, 8, 7) 
13. (4, 15, 5, 3) 
14. (4, 9, 2, 11) 
15. (8, 12, 0, 14) 
16. (8, 11, 2, 3) 
17. (0, 12, 8, 11) 
18. (0, 16, 6, 18) 
19. (7, 0, 12, 8) 
20. (7, 8, 11, 2) 
21. (13, 17, 19, 9) 
22. (13, 1, 15, 5) 
23. (15, 14, 17, 13) 
24. (15, 4, 9, 2) 
25. (16, 0, 7, 8) 
26. (11, 14, 17, 13) 
27. (11, 2, 9, 19) 
28. (3, 5, 15, 4) 
29. (9, 2, 11, 8) 
30. (10, 7, 18, 6) 

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
1. <(17, 13, 1, 15), (14, 4)>
2. <(17, 19, 9, 2), (14, 11)>
3. <(4, 15, 5, 3), (18, 9)>
4. <(0, 12, 8, 11), (14, 7)>
5. <(7, 8, 11, 2), (18, 12)>
6. <(15, 14, 17, 13), (4, 5)>
7. <(15, 4, 9, 2), (14, 15)>
8. <(16, 0, 7, 8), (18, 6)>
9. <(11, 14, 17, 13), (8, 12)>
10. <(3, 5, 15, 4), (9, 11)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 20 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [20].
