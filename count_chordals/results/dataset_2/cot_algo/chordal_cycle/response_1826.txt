Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 13) (21, 7) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 17) (4, 8) (4, 28) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 11) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 14) (26, 2) (19, 26) (19, 13) (17, 7) (17, 20) (17, 23) (20, 1) (20, 17) (20, 27) (20, 5) (5, 26) (5, 20) (5, 23) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 25) (25, 16) (25, 6) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 10) (28, 4) (28, 8) (28, 27) (28, 15) (9, 0) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 13) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 22) (11, 6) (2, 26) (2, 6) (23, 17) (23, 5) (6, 25) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 22) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 18) (24, 0) (24, 22) (24, 10) (24, 15) (22, 11) (22, 6) (22, 24) (22, 10) (22, 3) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 24) (3, 16) (3, 22) (3, 27) (27, 20) (27, 28) (27, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 24) (10, 22) 

Response:
Step 1: 
      The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
      - <1, 26, 5, 20, 1>
      - <0, 16, 25, 6, 0>
      - <0, 16, 25, 6, 11, 18, 13, 0>
      - <7, 21, 17, 20, 5, 23, 7>
      - <7, 21, 17, 20, 27, 28, 8, 4, 7>
      - <11, 7, 21, 17, 23, 5, 26, 2, 6, 11>
      - <13, 1, 20, 17, 23, 5, 26, 2, 6, 22, 10, 24, 22,18, 13>
      - <22, 11, 7, 21, 17, 20, 27, 28, 15, 24, 22>
      - <24, 0, 16, 25, 6, 22, 10, 14, 8, 28, 27, 20, 5, 23, 17, 13, 0>

Step 2:
      The unique chordal 4-cycle is:
      - <1, 26, 5, 20, 1>
      - <0, 16, 25, 6, 0>

Step 3:
      Since there are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [2].
