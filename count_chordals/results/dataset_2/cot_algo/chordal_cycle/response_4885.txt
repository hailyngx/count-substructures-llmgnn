Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 16) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 18) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 15) (0, 13) (7, 18) (1, 11) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 3) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 19) (4, 19) (4, 3) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 3) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 7) (18, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph (ensuring every edge in the cycle exists):
        - Cycle 1: 11-16-17-15-11
        - Cycle 2: 11-9-6-5-11
        - Cycle 3: 11-18-17-15-11
        - Cycle 4: 16-17-15-11-16
        - Cycle 5: 6-9-11-1-6
        - Cycle 6: 6-9-2-6
        - Cycle 7: 6-5-10-17-6
        - Cycle 8: 9-2-6-1-9
        - Cycle 9: 9-2-6-5-9
        - Cycle 10: 17-15-11-18-17
        - Cycle 11: 17-18-11-16-17
        - Cycle 12: 17-10-5-6-17
        - Cycle 13: 5-6-9-2-5
        - Cycle 14: 5-14-8-15-5
        - Cycle 15: 0-15-11-18-0
        - Cycle 16: 0-13-12-14-0
        - Cycle 17: 18-3-8-15-18
        - Cycle 18: 18-11-16-17-18
        - Cycle 19: 18-17-10-5-18
        - Cycle 20: 7-18-11-16-7
        - Cycle 21: 7-18-3-8-7
        - Cycle 22: 1-11-16-17-1
        - Cycle 23: 2-9-11-1-2
        - Cycle 24: 2-6-5-14-2
        - Cycle 25: 8-14-5-10-8
        - Cycle 26: 8-15-0-13-8
        - Cycle 27: 14-12-13-0-14
        - Cycle 28: 4-19-3-8-4
        - Cycle 29: 4-3-18-11-4
        - Cycle 30: 19-14-8-15-19

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, 6-1-9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 19-14-8>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, 15-11-18>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 15: <15, 11-17-18>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 25: <25, (8, 15), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        Final count: [25]
