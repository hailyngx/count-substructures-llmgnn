Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (7, 10, 6, 1, 7) with edges (7, 10), (10, 6), (6, 1), (1, 7), (7, 10)
- Cycle 2: (4, 11, 13, 3, 4) with edges (4, 11), (11, 13), (13, 3), (3, 4), (4, 11)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 10, 1, 4) with edges (4, 7), (7, 10), (10, 1), (1, 4), (4, 7)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 3, 1, 4) with edges (4, 8), (8, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4), (4, 8)
- Cycle 5: (4, 14, 9, 13, 4) with edges (4, 14), (14, 9), (9, 13), (13, 4), (4, 14)
- Cycle 6: (6, 12, 9, 13, 6) with edges (6, 12), (12, 9), (9, 13), (13, 6), (6, 12)
- Cycle 7: (10, 5, 11, 6, 10) with edges (10, 5), (5, 11), (11, 6), (6, 10), (10, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord (6, 1)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord (11, 3)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord (10, 4)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord (8, 1)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord (9, 13)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord (12, 6)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord (5, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are a total of 7 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <7, (6, 1)>
- <4, (11, 3)>
- <4, (10, 4)>
- <4, (8, 1)>
- <4, (9, 13)>
- <6, (12, 6)>
- <10, (5, 11)>
