Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:

1. (4, 5, 9, 1)
2. (4, 5, 9, 3)
3. (4, 5, 8, 9)
4. (4, 11, 1, 9)
5. (4, 11, 10, 7)
6. (4, 11, 13, 1)
7. (4, 2, 7, 10)
8. (4, 2, 6, 12)
9. (4, 2, 6, 13)
10. (5, 9, 1, 13)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle (4, 5, 9, 1) has a chord (9, 8).
- The cycle (4, 5, 9, 3) is chordal due to edge (9, 8).
- The cycle (4, 5, 8, 9) is chordal due to edge (5, 4).
- The cycle (4, 11, 1, 9) has a chord (1, 13).
- The cycle (4, 11, 10, 7) is chordal due to edge (11, 13).
- The cycle (4, 11, 13, 1) has a chord (11, 10).
- The cycle (4, 2, 7, 10) is chordal due to edge (4, 11).
- The cycle (4, 2, 6, 12) is chordal due to edge (2, 4).
- The cycle (4, 2, 6, 13) has a chord (2, 7).
- The cycle (5, 9, 1, 13) has a chord (9, 3).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<4, (4, 5, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 2, 7, 10)>
<8, (4, 2, 6, 12)>
<10, (5, 9, 1, 13)>
