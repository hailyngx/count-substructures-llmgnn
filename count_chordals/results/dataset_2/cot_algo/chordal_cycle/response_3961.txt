Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <9, 26, 22, 27> has one chord: (9, 27)
- <9, 26, 28, 2> has one chord: (26, 2)
- <2, 8, 20, 11> has one chord: (8, 11)
- <13, 18, 26, 22, 27> has one chord: (13, 26)
- <17, 23, 21, 17> has one chord: (23, 21)
- <17, 23, 21, 17, 10> has one chord: (23, 10)
- <0, 11, 20, 8, 13> has one chord: (11, 8)
- <11, 6, 29, 25> has one chord: (6, 25)
- <16, 3, 7, 23> has one chord: (3, 23)
- <14, 2, 8, 20> has one chord: (2, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
