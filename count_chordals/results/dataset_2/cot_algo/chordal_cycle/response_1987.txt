Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 8) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 1) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 11) (7, 9) (16, 5) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 11) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 2) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 8) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 15) (2, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- <3, 15, 19, 11>  
- <4, 12, 18, 1>  
- <5, 6, 17, 11>  
- <6, 17, 11, 2>  
- <5, 6, 11, 17>  
- <11, 17, 6, 5>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, 15, 19, 11> has exactly one chord (3, 19): <3, (3, 19), 11>
- <4, 12, 18, 1> has exactly one chord (12, 18): <4, (12, 18), 1>
- <5, 6, 17, 11> has exactly one chord (6, 17): <5, (6, 17), 11>
- <6, 17, 11, 2> has exactly one chord (6, 11): <6, (6, 11), 2>
- <5, 6, 11, 17> has exactly one chord (5, 11): <5, (5, 11), 17>
- <11, 17, 6, 5> has exactly one chord (6, 5): <11, (6, 5), 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:  
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [6].
