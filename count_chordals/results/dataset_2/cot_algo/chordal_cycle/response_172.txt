Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 12)

3. Cycle: <1, 6, 4, 3, 14, 9>
4. Cycle: <1, 6, 4, 10, 7>
5. Cycle: <1, 6, 4, 10, 12>
6. Cycle: <1, 6, 4, 10, 8, 14>
7. Cycle: <1, 6, 5, 2, 14, 9>
8. Cycle: <1, 6, 5, 13, 2>
9. Cycle: <1, 6, 5, 8, 10>
10. Cycle: <1, 6, 5, 10, 4>
11. Cycle: <1, 9, 14, 3, 4>
12. Cycle: <1, 9, 14, 8, 10>
13. Cycle: <1, 7, 10, 4, 5>

15. Cycle: <3, 4, 10, 7, 0>
16. Cycle: <3, 4, 10, 8, 14>
17. Cycle: <3, 14, 9, 10, 4>
18. Cycle: <4, 5, 2, 3, 14>
19. Cycle: <4, 5, 2, 13, 0>
20. Cycle: <4, 5, 8, 10, 7>
21. Cycle: <5, 6, 1, 7, 0>
22. Cycle: <5, 6, 1, 11, 14>
23. Cycle: <5, 6, 4, 10, 7>
24. Cycle: <5, 6, 4, 10, 12>
25. Cycle: <5, 6, 4, 3, 14>
26. Cycle: <5, 6, 4, 3, 2>
27. Cycle: <5, 8, 10, 4, 3>
28. Cycle: <7, 10, 4, 3, 14>
29. Cycle: <10, 4, 3, 14, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (6, 4), 5, 2>
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (6, 4), 3, 2>
3. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (6, 4), 10, 7>
4. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (6, 4), 10, 12>
5. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (6, 4), 10, 8, 14>
6. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (6, 5), 8, 10>
7. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (7, 10), 4, 5>
8. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (11, 14), 8, 10>
9. Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (4, 10), 7, 0>
10. Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (4, 10), 8, 14>
11. Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (14, 9), 10, 4>
12. Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (5, 2), 3, 14>
13. Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (5, 2), 13, 0>
14. Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (5, 8), 10, 7>
15. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (6, 1), 7, 0>
16. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (6, 1), 11, 14>
17. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (8, 10), 4, 3>
18. Chordal 4-cycle: <7, (10, 4), 3, 14>
19. Chordal 4-cycle: <10, (4, 3), 14, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [19]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is 19.
