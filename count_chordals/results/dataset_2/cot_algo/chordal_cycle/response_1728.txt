Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 3) (2, 18) (5, 6) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 3) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 4) (1, 6) (9, 13) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 19) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 17) (16, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4: 
- Cycle 1: 4-8-18-2-4
- Cycle 2: 6-11-17-16-6
- Cycle 3: 6-1-4-15-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the cycles listed above, only Cycle 1: 4-8-18-2-4 has exactly one chord, which is the edge (8, 2) connecting non-adjacent nodes 8 and 2.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

As we have found 1 chordal 4-cycle, the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <4, (8, 2), 18>
