Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 14) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (2, 7) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 6 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 1 - 13 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 1 - 10 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 10 - 14 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 1 - 13 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 6: 1 - 6 - 3 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 6 - 9 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 8: 1 - 13 - 5 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 9: 3 - 6 - 9 - 4 - 3
- Cycle 10: 4 - 9 - 6 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 11: 4 - 9 - 5 - 13 - 4
- Cycle 12: 7 - 0 - 1 - 13 - 7
- Cycle 13: 7 - 10 - 1 - 13 - 7
- Cycle 14: 10 - 1 - 13 - 5 - 10
- Cycle 15: 12 - 0 - 1 - 13 - 12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 1, 13, 5> with chord (0, 13)
- <1, 6, 3, 4> with chord (6, 4)
- <1, 13, 5, 9> with chord (5, 9)
- <4, 9, 5, 13> with chord (4, 5)
- <7, 0, 1, 13> with chord (0, 13)
- <7, 10, 1, 13> with chord (10, 13)
- <10, 1, 13, 5> with chord (1, 5)
- <12, 0, 1, 13> with chord (0, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [8].
