Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 2, 3>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 13, 0>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 11, 13>
- Cycle 5: <5, 6, 10, 9>
- Cycle 6: <5, 6, 10, 11>
- Cycle 7: <5, 7, 1, 4>
- Cycle 8: <5, 7, 1, 8>
- Cycle 9: <5, 7, 14, 12>
- Cycle 10: <9, 11, 10, 6>
- Cycle 11: <9, 11, 10, 14>
- Cycle 12: <9, 10, 4, 8>
- Cycle 13: <9, 10, 4, 1>
- Cycle 14: <9, 10, 6, 1>
- Cycle 15: <9, 10, 6, 8>
- Cycle 16: <4, 8, 12, 14>
- Cycle 17: <4, 8, 6, 10>
- Cycle 18: <4, 10, 6, 6>
- Cycle 19: <4, 10, 6, 3>
- Cycle 20: <4, 10, 14, 12>
- Cycle 21: <7, 1, 11, 13>
- Cycle 22: <7, 1, 6, 3>
- Cycle 23: <10, 11, 13, 0>
- Cycle 24: <10, 6, 3, 2>
- Cycle 25: <0, 14, 12, 8>
- Cycle 26: <0, 14, 10, 6>
- Cycle 27: <8, 6, 3, 2>
- Cycle 28: <13, 11, 1, 8>
- Cycle 29: <2, 3, 6, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 2, 0>, Chord: (9, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 6, 10, 9>, Chord: (5, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 7, 1, 4>, Chord: (7, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 8, 12, 14>, Chord: (8, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
