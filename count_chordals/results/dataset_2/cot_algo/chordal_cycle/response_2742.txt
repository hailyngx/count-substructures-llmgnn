Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle: 0-5-7-6-0
2. Cycle: 0-8-1-9-0
3. Cycle: 0-7-4-6-0
4. Cycle: 0-8-4-7-0
5. Cycle: 1-8-4-7-1
6. Cycle: 1-9-6-7-1
7. Cycle: 2-8-4-3-2

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle: 0-5-7-6-0 has chord (5, 6)
2. Cycle: 0-8-1-9-0 has chord (1, 9)
3. Cycle: 0-7-4-6-0 has chord (4, 7)
4. Cycle: 0-8-4-7-0 has chord (4, 7)
5. Cycle: 1-8-4-7-1 has chord (4, 7)
6. Cycle: 1-9-6-7-1 has chord (6, 7)
7. Cycle: 2-8-4-3-2 has chord (4, 3)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found = 7
Therefore, the final answer is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, (5, 6), 7, 0)>
<0, (1, 9), 8, 0)>
<0, (4, 7), 6, 0)>
<1, (4, 7), 8, 1)>
<1, (6, 7), 9, 1)>
<2, (4, 3), 8, 2)>
