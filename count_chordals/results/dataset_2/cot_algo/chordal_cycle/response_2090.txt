Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 0-7-2-13-5-1-3-0
- Cycle 2: 1-3-9-13-2-11-10-1
- Cycle 3: 4-0-7-13-9-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (5, 13) connecting non-adjacent nodes 5 and 13.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. Since only Cycle 1 has a chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <<5, 13, (5, 13), 1, 3>>
