Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 12) (21, 18) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 7) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 27) (5, 6) (5, 28) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 20) (26, 7) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 12) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 2) (18, 21) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 11) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 11) (27, 23) (7, 9) (7, 22) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 4) (25, 7) (25, 17) (25, 28) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 13) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 8) (16, 22) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 17) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 24) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 15) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 24) (10, 29) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 10) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 20) (20, 23) (20, 26) (20, 2) (15, 22) (15, 28) (24, 17) (24, 10) (24, 29) (14, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (29, 10) (29, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<1, 26, 7, 9>  
<1, 26, 20, 23>  
<1, 26, 7, 22>  
<1, 12, 19, 11>  
<1, 12, 10, 6>  
<1, 12, 10, 24>  
<26, 19, 11, 23>  
<26, 19, 12, 10>  
<26, 19, 12, 1>  
<20, 23, 11, 19>  
<20, 23, 27, 22>  
<20, 23, 11, 18>  
<7, 9, 18, 4>  
<7, 9, 18, 11>  
<7, 9, 18, 21>  
<9, 18, 4, 25>  
<9, 18, 11, 23>  
<9, 18, 21, 16>  
<22, 16, 7, 25>  
<22, 16, 7, 26>  
<22, 16, 17, 24>  
<23, 11, 18, 4>  
<23, 11, 19, 12>  
<23, 11, 18, 9>  
<5, 6, 10, 12>  
<5, 6, 9, 18>  
<5, 6, 10, 24>  
<6, 10, 24, 29>  
<6, 10, 12, 1>  
<6, 10, 24, 17>  
<6, 3, 0, 8>  
<6, 3, 8, 0>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<1, (26, 7), 9>  
<20, (23, 11), 19>  
<7, (9, 18), 4>  
<22, (16, 7), 25>  
<23, (11, 18), 19>  
<5, (6, 10), 12>  
<6, (10, 24), 29>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
