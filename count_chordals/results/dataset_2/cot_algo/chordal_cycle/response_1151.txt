Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5 - 4 - 1 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 2 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 4 - 0 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 4 - 2 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 5: 5 - 7 - 1 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 6: 5 - 7 - 3 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 7: 5 - 7 - 8 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 8: 5 - 3 - 0 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 9: 5 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 10: 5 - 2 - 0 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 11: 5 - 6 - 9 - 7 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: <1, 7>
- Cycle 2: <2, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3>
- Cycle 4: <2, 0>
- Cycle 5: <7, 4>
- Cycle 6: <3, 1>
- Cycle 7: <8, 6>
- Cycle 8: <0, 4>
- Cycle 9: <1, 4>
- Cycle 10: <0, 4>
- Cycle 11: <9, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 11 chordal 4-cycles. So, the final answer is [11].
