Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (3, 6, 9, 13)
- Cycle 2: (3, 6, 1, 0)
- Cycle 3: (4, 12, 9, 13)
- Cycle 4: (4, 12, 1, 0)
- Cycle 5: (1, 12, 9, 13)
- Cycle 6: (1, 12, 4, 10)
- Cycle 7: (6, 9, 11, 8)
- Cycle 8: (6, 9, 1, 0)
- Cycle 9: (6, 9, 11, 14)
- Cycle 10: (6, 3, 5, 11)
- Cycle 11: (6, 3, 11, 14)
- Cycle 12: (8, 0, 1, 12)
- Cycle 13: (8, 0, 13, 2)
- Cycle 14: (8, 13, 2, 6)
- Cycle 15: (13, 2, 12, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, 6, 9, 13>: Chord (6, 13)
- <3, 6, 1, 0>: Chord (6, 1)
- <4, 12, 9, 13>: Chord (4, 9)
- <6, 9, 1, 0>: Chord (9, 1)
- <1, 12, 9, 13>: Chord (12, 9)
- <6, 9, 11, 8>: Chord (9, 11)
- <6, 3, 11, 14>: Chord (6, 11)
- <8, 0, 13, 2>: Chord (0, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 8 chordal 4-cycles, so the final answer is [8].
