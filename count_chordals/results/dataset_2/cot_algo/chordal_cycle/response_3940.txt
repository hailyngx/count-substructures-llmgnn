Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 3, 0, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 8, 0, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 8, 6, 5, 9)
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 5, 1, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 0, 3, 1, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 6, 5, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 5, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 4, 0, 3, 7)
- Cycle 10: (1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
- Cycle 11: (3, 4, 0, 2, 3)
- Cycle 12: (6, 8, 0, 2, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord (5, 0)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord (9, 8)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord (0, 3)
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord (0, 3)
- Cycle 10 has exactly one chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 11 has exactly one chord (2, 0)
- Cycle 12 has exactly one chord (8, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [12].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 1, (3, 7), 4>
<5, 1, (0, 5), 4>
<5, 9, (8, 4), 7>
<9, 8, (6, 5), 9>
<4, 7, (1, 5), 4>
<4, 0, (1, 3), 4>
<4, 8, (5, 4), 8>
<7, 5, (1, 3), 7>
<7, 4, (3, 0), 7>
<1, 3, (0, 2), 1>
<3, 4, (0, 2), 3>
<6, 8, (0, 2), 6>
