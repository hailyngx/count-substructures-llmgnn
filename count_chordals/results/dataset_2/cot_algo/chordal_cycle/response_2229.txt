Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles with length 4: 
    - <5, 4, 2, 8, 5>
    - <5, 4, 7, 3, 5>
    - <9, 4, 7, 3, 9>
    - <9, 4, 2, 8, 9>
    - <7, 4, 2, 8, 7>
    - <1, 3, 7, 4, 1>
    - <1, 3, 5, 0, 1>
    - <1, 3, 2, 4, 1>
    - <3, 7, 4, 2, 3>
    - <3, 7, 4, 9, 3>
    - <8, 4, 7, 3, 8>
    - <8, 4, 5, 0, 8>
    - <2, 4, 7, 3, 2>
    - <2, 4, 9, 0, 2>
    - <0, 8, 4, 9, 0>
    - <0, 8, 2, 4, 0>
    - <6, 1, 3, 7, 6>
    
Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycles:
    - <5, 4, 2, 8, 5>, Chord: (4, 8)
    - <9, 4, 2, 8, 9>, Chord: (4, 8)
    - <1, 3, 2, 4, 1>, Chord: (3, 2)
    - <3, 7, 4, 9, 3>, Chord: (7, 9)
    - <8, 4, 5, 0, 8>, Chord: (4, 5)

Step 3:
- Count of chordal 4-cycles: [5]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <5, 4, 2, 8, 5> with chord (4, 8)
- <9, 4, 2, 8, 9> with chord (4, 8)
- <1, 3, 2, 4, 1> with chord (3, 2)
- <3, 7, 4, 9, 3> with chord (7, 9)
- <8, 4, 5, 0, 8> with chord (4, 5)
