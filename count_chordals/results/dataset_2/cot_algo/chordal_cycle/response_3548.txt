Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 11) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 8) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (2, 12) (2, 6) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 15) (12, 1) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (18, 10) (18, 12) (3, 6) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 3) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 15) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 16) (16, 4) (16, 1) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 5) 

Response:
Step 1:  
Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 11, 17, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 5, 15, 12, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 16, 1, 19, 4)
- Cycle 4: (5, 8, 19, 1, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 11, 17, 13, 5)
- Cycle 6: (12, 1, 16, 4, 12)
- Cycle 7: (12, 1, 19, 14, 12)
- Cycle 8: (13, 0, 9, 14, 13)
- Cycle 9: (13, 0, 10, 8, 13)
- Cycle 10: (14, 9, 13, 17, 14)
- Cycle 11: (14, 9, 0, 13, 14)
- Cycle 12: (14, 19, 1, 16, 14)

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, 5, 11, 17>, (5, 17)
- <4, 5, 15, 12>, (4, 15)
- <4, 16, 1, 19>, (4, 1)
- <5, 8, 19, 1>, (5, 19)
- <12, 1, 16, 4>, (12, 16)
- <13, 0, 9, 14>, (13, 9)
- <13, 0, 10, 8>, (13, 10)
- <14, 9, 13, 17>, (14, 13)
- <14, 9, 0, 13>, (14, 0)
- <14, 19, 1, 16>, (14, 1)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found = [0].
