Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 17) (7, 10) (7, 17) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 2) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 0) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (9, 3) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 16) (6, 1) (6, 2) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 14) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 6) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (4, 0, 10, 7, 17, 4)
- Cycle 2: (5, 13, 15, 12, 16, 5)
- Cycle 3: (3, 10, 5, 19, 11, 3)
- Cycle 4: (7, 10, 0, 4, 17, 7)
- Cycle 5: (19, 5, 13, 18, 19)
- Cycle 6: (1, 11, 3, 9, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 19, 5, 16, 2)
- Cycle 8: (16, 1, 14, 18, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, (3, 9), 11, 1> has one chord (3, 9)
- <2, (5, 16), 19, 2> has one chord (5, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 6 chordless cycles found, so the final answer is [6].
