Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 3) (4, 19) (8, 12) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 2) (5, 1) (5, 17) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 15) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 2) (15, 9) (15, 19) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 2) (16, 14) (16, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 6 - 1 - 5 - 17 - 10 - 3 - 7 - 12 - 0 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 1 - 5 - 17 - 12 - 0 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 9 - 15 - 19 - 4 - 3 - 10 - 17 - 7 - 12 - 0 - 13 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 9 - 15 - 19 - 4 - 3 - 7 - 12 - 0 - 13 - 6
- Cycle 5: 6 - 11 - 2 - 18 - 14 - 16 - 2 - 13 - 7 - 12 - 17 - 5 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 6: 6 - 11 - 2 - 16 - 14 - 18 - 2 - 13 - 7 - 12 - 17 - 5 - 1 - 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <6, 1, 5, 17> has a chord (5, 17)
- <6, 9, 15, 19> has a chord (9, 19)
- <6, 11, 2, 16> has a chord (11, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless 4-cycles found. In this case, there are no chordless 4-cycles.

Therefore, in this graph, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [3].
