Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-7-5
- Cycle 2: 5-8-7-2-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-6-9-5
- Cycle 4: 5-10-8-9-5
- Cycle 5: 9-6-1-5-9
- Cycle 6: 9-8-2-7-9
- Cycle 7: 9-4-7-2-9
- Cycle 8: 4-7-2-8-4
- Cycle 9: 7-1-6-9-7
- Cycle 10: 7-8-2-11-7
- Cycle 11: 6-9-8-10-6
- Cycle 12: 6-1-7-2-6
- Cycle 13: 2-7-8-9-2
- Cycle 14: 8-10-14-12-8
- Cycle 15: 0-6-9-12-0
- Cycle 16: 0-2-7-4-0
- Cycle 17: 0-3-12-14-0
- Cycle 18: 14-12-9-4-14
- Cycle 19: 14-13-10-5-14

Step 2:  
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (4, 7), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (7, 2), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (6, 9), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (8, 9), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (6, 1), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, (8, 2), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <9, (7, 2), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, (7, 8), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <7, (1, 6), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <7, (2, 8), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <6, (8, 10), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <6, (1, 7), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <2, (7, 8), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <8, (10, 14), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <0, (9, 12), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <0, (7, 4), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <0, (12, 14), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <14, (9, 4), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <14, (10, 5), 13>

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal cycles found, we get [19].
