Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

1. <7, 12, 24, 13, 11>
2. <7, 12, 24, 25, 10>
3. <7, 19, 22, 14, 18>
4. <7, 19, 22, 1, 8>
5. <7, 19, 4, 21, 15>
6. <12, 24, 13, 3, 17>
7. <12, 24, 25, 23, 5>
8. <11, 28, 8, 6, 1>
9. <11, 28, 20, 16, 9>
10. <11, 13, 3, 17, 18>
11. <28, 8, 6, 1, 20>
12. <28, 8, 17, 3, 13>
13. <28, 20, 16, 9, 0>
14. <8, 6, 1, 20, 16>
15. <19, 22, 1, 20, 16>
16. <19, 22, 14, 18, 21>
17. <19, 4, 5, 27, 3>
18. <19, 4, 21, 15, 5>
19. <4, 21, 18, 14, 22>
20. <4, 21, 22, 1, 20>
21. <21, 18, 14, 22, 19>
22. <21, 22, 1, 20, 16>
23. <5, 27, 3, 17, 7>
24. <5, 27, 2, 26, 10>
25. <5, 23, 25, 24, 12>
26. <26, 2, 27, 3, 13>
27. <1, 20, 16, 9, 0>
28. <6, 8, 17, 3, 13>
29. <22, 1, 8, 6, 1>
30. <22, 1, 20, 16, 9>
31. <22, 14, 18, 17, 7>
32. <3, 17, 18, 14, 22>
33. <17, 3, 13, 24, 12>
34. <23, 5, 27, 2, 26>
35. <25, 24, 13, 3, 17>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <7, 12, 24, 13, 11> [Chord: (24, 13)]
2. <7, 19, 22, 1, 8> [Chord: (22, 1)]
3. <7, 19, 4, 21, 15> [Chord: (4, 21)]
4. <12, 24, 25, 23, 5> [Chord: (25, 23)]
5. <11, 28, 20, 16, 9> [Chord: (28, 20)]
6. <4, 21, 18, 14, 22> [Chord: (21, 18)]
7. <5, 27, 3, 17, 7> [Chord: (27, 3)]
8. <1, 20, 16, 9, 0> [Chord: (20, 16)]
9. <22, 1, 8, 6, 1> [Chord: (1, 8)]
10. <3, 17, 18, 14, 22> [Chord: (17, 18)]

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
