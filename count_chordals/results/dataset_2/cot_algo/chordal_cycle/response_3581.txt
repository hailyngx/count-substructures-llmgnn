Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-8-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-8-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-1-4-0
- Cycle 4: 1-2-6-5-1
- Cycle 5: 1-2-6-9-1
- Cycle 6: 4-1-2-0-4
- Cycle 7: 4-7-5-6-4
- Cycle 8: 5-0-9-7-5
- Cycle 9: 5-7-8-3-5
- Cycle 10: 6-2-0-9-6
- Cycle 11: 7-4-1-0-7
- Cycle 12: 7-8-5-6-7
- Cycle 13: 8-5-0-2-8
- Cycle 14: 9-6-2-0-9
- Cycle 15: 9-7-3-8-9

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has no chords.
- Cycle 6 has no chords.
- Cycle 7 has one chord: <7, (5, 6), 4>.
- Cycle 8 has no chords.
- Cycle 9 has one chord: <5, (7, 8), 3>.
- Cycle 10 has no chords.
- Cycle 11 has one chord: <4, (1, 0), 7>.
- Cycle 12 has one chord: <8, (5, 6), 7>.
- Cycle 13 has one chord: <2, (0, 9), 8>.
- Cycle 14 has no chords.
- Cycle 15 has one chord: <9, (3, 8), 7>.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
