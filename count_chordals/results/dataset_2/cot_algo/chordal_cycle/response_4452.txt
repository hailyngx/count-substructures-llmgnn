Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (1, 17) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 18) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 3) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (15, 19) (15, 0) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 2) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 2) (4, 9) (4, 16) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 5) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 4) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: 1 - 17 - 6 - 10 - 1
        - Cycle 2: 1 - 8 - 18 - 12 - 1
        - Cycle 3: 1 - 8 - 14 - 19 - 1
        - Cycle 4: 1 - 17 - 13 - 16 - 1
        - Cycle 5: 1 - 17 - 6 - 10 - 7 - 19 - 1
        - Cycle 6: 1 - 8 - 14 - 2 - 7 - 19 - 1
        - Cycle 7: 1 - 8 - 3 - 9 - 16 - 13 - 17 - 1
        - Cycle 8: 1 - 8 - 3 - 9 - 4 - 16 - 13 - 17 - 1
        - Cycle 9: 1 - 17 - 6 - 2 - 14 - 8 - 1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Cycle 1: <1, (17, 6), 10>
        - Cycle 2: <1, (8, 12), 18>
        - Cycle 3: <1, (8, 14), 19>
        - Cycle 4: <1, (17, 13), 16>
        - Cycle 5: <1, (7, 19), 10>
        - Cycle 6: <1, (14, 2), 8>
        - Cycle 7: No chord found
        - Cycle 8: No chord found
        - Cycle 9: <1, (6, 2), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

        From Step 2, we have found 5 unique chordal 4-cycles.

Final Answer: [5]
