Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 6, 0, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 2, 13, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 10, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 7, 13, 11, 8, 9, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 9, 8, 11, 14, 12, 2, 3, 1)
- Cycle 6: (3, 10, 4, 5, 1, 9, 8, 11, 6, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 12, 14, 4, 10, 5, 7, 0, 6, 11, 13, 2, 3)
- Cycle 8: (10, 3, 2, 13, 11, 14, 4, 0, 6, 11, 8, 7, 5, 1, 9, 10)
- Cycle 9: (11, 6, 0, 7, 5, 4, 10, 3, 2, 13, 11)
- Cycle 10: (0, 1, 9, 8, 11, 14, 12, 2, 3, 10, 4, 0)
- Cycle 11: (0, 9, 8, 11, 14, 4, 13, 2, 3, 6, 7, 0)
- Cycle 12: (7, 13, 11, 8, 9, 1, 5, 4, 10, 3, 12, 14, 6, 0, 7)
- Cycle 13: (13, 4, 10, 3, 2, 12, 14, 11, 6, 0, 9, 8, 7, 5, 13)

Step 2: Checking for chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chord detected: (3, 0) 
- Cycle 2: Chord detected: (1, 13)
- Cycle 3: Chord detected: (4, 9)
- Cycle 4: Chord detected: (11, 8)
- Cycle 5: Chord detected: (8, 11)
- Cycle 6: Chord detected: (10, 5)
- Cycle 7: Chord detected: (0, 6)
- Cycle 8: Chord detected: (3, 12)
- Cycle 9: Chord detected: (6, 11)
- Cycle 10: Chord detected: (1, 9)
- Cycle 11: Chord detected: (0, 8)
- Cycle 12: Chord detected: (13, 7)
- Cycle 13: Chord detected: (4, 10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are 13 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<1, (3, 0)>
<2, (1, 13)>
<3, (4, 9)>
<4, (11, 8)>
<5, (8, 11)>
<6, (10, 5)>
<7, (0, 6)>
<8, (3, 12)>
<9, (6, 11)>
<10, (1, 9)>
<11, (0, 8)>
<12, (13, 7)>
<13, (4, 10)>
