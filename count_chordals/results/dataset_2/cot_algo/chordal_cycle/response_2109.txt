Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 6, 0, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 3, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 6, 4, 8, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 2, 4, 6, 9)
- Cycle 6: (6, 0, 1, 3, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 3, 1, 7, 6)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 2, 9, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 6, 3, 1, 4)
- Cycle 10: (8, 4, 6, 0, 8)
- Cycle 11: (8, 0, 3, 1, 8)
- Cycle 12: (8, 7, 1, 3, 8)
- Cycle 13: (2, 9, 5, 3, 2)
- Cycle 14: (2, 4, 6, 0, 2)
- Cycle 15: (0, 5, 4, 8, 0)
- Cycle 16: (0, 6, 7, 1, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <5, (9, 4), 6>
- <4, (6, 0), 5>
- <3, (6, 4), 5>
- <6, (9, 4), 8>
- <2, (9, 4), 6>
- <1, (3, 6), 0>
- <7, (1, 3), 6>
- <8, (4, 6), 9>
- <4, (6, 3), 1>
- <8, (4, 6), 0>
- <1, (3, 8), 0>
- <3, (1, 7), 6>
- <5, (9, 3), 2>
- <2, (4, 6), 0>
- <8, (4, 5), 0>
- <6, (7, 1), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 16 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, so the final answer is [16].
