Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles with 4 nodes: 
    - <5, 9, 3, 1, 5>
    - <4, 7, 3, 1, 4>
    - <6, 9, 3, 1, 6>
    - <2, 8, 3, 1, 2>
    - <0, 5, 1, 4, 0>
  
Step 2:
- Checking for chords:
    - <5, 9, 3, 1, 5> has a chord (9, 1) as (9, 5, 1) form a cycle.
    - <4, 7, 3, 1, 4> has a chord (7, 1) as (7, 4, 1) form a cycle.
    - <6, 9, 3, 1, 6> has a chord (9, 1) as (9, 6, 1) form a cycle.
    - <2, 8, 3, 1, 2> has a chord (8, 1) as (8, 2, 1) form a cycle.
    - <0, 5, 1, 4, 0> has a chord (5, 4) as (5, 0, 4) form a cycle.

Step 3:
- Counting chordless cycles: [0]

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
