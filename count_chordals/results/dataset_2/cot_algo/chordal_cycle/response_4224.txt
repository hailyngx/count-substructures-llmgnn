Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 2) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 4) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 13) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 15) (14, 19) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 19) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 1) (12, 17) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 10) (18, 16) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 8) (6, 11) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 11-16-17-12 (length = 4)
- Cycle 2: 11-13-19-12 (length = 4)
- Cycle 3: 11-4-1-5-3-15-14-19-13 (length = 8)
- Cycle 4: 11-4-15-14-19-13-17-12 (length = 7)
- Cycle 5: 11-13-17-12-19-14-15-3 (length = 7)
- Cycle 6: 11-13-17-12-19-14-15-5 (length = 7)
- Cycle 7: 16-17-13-19-12-14-15-3 (length = 7)
- Cycle 8: 16-17-13-19-14-15-5 (length = 7)
- Cycle 9: 16-17-13-19-12-14-15-5 (length = 7)
- Cycle 10: 16-17-13-19-14-15-3 (length = 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: 11-16-17-12 with chord 16-18 <11, (16, 18), 12)>
- Cycle 2: 11-13-19-12 with chord 13-10 <11, (13, 10), 12)>
- Cycle 4: 11-4-15-14-19-13-17-12 with chord 4-1 <11, (4, 1), 12)> and chord 15-3 <11, (15, 3), 12)>
- Cycle 6: 11-13-17-12-19-14-15-5 with chord 13-9 <11, (13, 9), 5)>
- Cycle 7: 16-17-13-19-12-14-15-3 with chord 13-9 <16, (13, 9), 3)>
- Cycle 10: 16-17-13-19-14-15-3 with chord 13-7 <16, (13, 7), 3)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
