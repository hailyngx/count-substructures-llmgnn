Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-8-3-7-4
- Cycle 2: 4-5-6-7-4
- Cycle 3: 4-5-6-1-4
- Cycle 4: 4-5-3-6-4
- Cycle 5: 4-9-7-3-4
- Cycle 6: 4-9-1-6-4

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (5,7).
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (5,6).
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (9,7).
- Cycle 6 has no chords.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found: <2, (5,7)>, <3, (5,6)>, <5, (9,7)>.

Putting this final number inside brackets, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
