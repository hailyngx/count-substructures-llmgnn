- Cycle 2: (1, 22, 3, 16) 
- Cycle 3: (1, 22, 13, 23) 
- Cycle 4: (1, 21, 27, 4) 
- Cycle 5: (1, 21, 5, 24) 
- Cycle 6: (1, 21, 26, 0) 
- Cycle 7: (1, 21, 27, 28) 
- Cycle 8: (1, 19, 24, 4) 
- Cycle 9: (1, 12, 15, 16) 
- Cycle 10: (1, 12, 9, 12) 
- Cycle 11: (13, 10, 25, 7) 
- Cycle 12: (13, 22, 1, 21) 
- Cycle 13: (13, 22, 3, 16) 
- Cycle 14: (13, 23, 15, 20) 
- Cycle 15: (13, 23, 7, 25)

- Cycle 18: (22, 13, 23, 7) 
- Cycle 19: (22, 1, 19, 24) 
- Cycle 20: (22, 1, 12, 15) 
- Cycle 21: (22, 1, 21, 27) 
- Cycle 22: (22, 3, 16, 15) 
- Cycle 23: (22, 3, 16, 8) 
- Cycle 24: (22, 3, 14, 25) 
- Cycle 25: (22, 3, 14, 18) 
- Cycle 26: (22, 3, 8, 0) 
- Cycle 27: (22, 3, 16, 28)

- Cycle 29: (22, 1, 21, 26) 
- Cycle 30: (22, 1, 21, 27) 
- ... (remaining cycles)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<1, 22, 13, 10> - Chord (13, 22)
