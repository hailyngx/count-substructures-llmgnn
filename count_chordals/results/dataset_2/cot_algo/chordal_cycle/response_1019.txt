Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 19) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 17) (17, 13) (17, 9) (6, 8) (6, 14) (16, 3) (16, 7) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 9) (12, 11) (12, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3 - 15 - 9 - 17 - 13 - 3
- Cycle 2: 4 - 9 - 17 - 13 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 9 - 15 - 3 - 13 - 4
- Cycle 4: 4 - 9 - 15 - 16 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 5: 4 - 9 - 15 - 3 - 1 - 11 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 6: 4 - 10 - 12 - 11 - 1 - 3 - 13 - 17 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 7: 4 - 5 - 14 - 18 - 2 - 0 - 1 - 11 - 12 - 10 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (17, 3)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (9, 15)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (9, 15)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (15, 3)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (11, 13)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (18, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [7].
