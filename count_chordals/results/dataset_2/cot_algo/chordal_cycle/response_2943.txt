Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 23) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 19) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 23) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 4) (20, 25) (20, 9) (20, 4) (20, 6) (2, 15) (18, 1) (18, 27) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 22) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 19) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 20) (9, 22) (9, 28) (22, 12) (22, 9) (22, 28) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 24) (13, 5) (21, 23) (26, 14) (26, 7) (26, 5) (26, 8) (26, 27) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 0) (24, 5) (24, 29) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 24) (29, 4) (28, 0) (28, 9) (28, 22) (28, 27) (27, 18) (27, 26) (27, 28) (8, 3) (8, 26) (8, 15) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 29) (6, 16) (6, 20) (6, 12) (15, 2) (15, 8) (23, 14) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (7, 12, 22, 9, 17, 14, 26, 7) 
- Cycle 2: (5, 11, 16, 6, 5) 
- Cycle 3: (26, 7, 12, 6, 26) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has chords: (12, 14), (22, 26), (9, 17)
- Cycle 2 has chords: (11, 16), (5, 6)
- Cycle 3 has chords: (7, 12), (6, 26)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are no chordless 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
