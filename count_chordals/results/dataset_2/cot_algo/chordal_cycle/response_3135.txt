Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 18) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 10) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 15) (1, 13) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 15) (6, 3) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 14) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 18) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 7-16-13-8-7
- Cycle 2: 7-3-5-2-7
- Cycle 3: 7-12-6-15-7
- Cycle 4: 5-16-13-10-5

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (7, 13)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (13, 10)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (7, 13), 8, 16>
<2, (5, 7), 3, 16>
<4, (13, 10), 5, 16>
