Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 2, 1)
- Cycle 4: (6, 5, 3, 6)
- Cycle 5: (5, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 6: (3, 4, 9, 3)
- Cycle 7: (4, 9, 8, 4)
- Cycle 8: (9, 8, 1, 9)
- Cycle 9: (8, 1, 7, 8)
- Cycle 10: (1, 7, 8, 1)
- Cycle 11: (6, 2, 3, 6)
- Cycle 12: (2, 3, 4, 2)
- Cycle 13: (3, 2, 6, 3)
- Cycle 14: (2, 6, 0, 2)
- Cycle 15: (6, 0, 1, 6)
- Cycle 16: (0, 1, 8, 0)
- Cycle 17: (1, 8, 4, 1)
- Cycle 18: (8, 4, 9, 8)
- Cycle 19: (4, 9, 6, 4)
- Cycle 20: (9, 6, 5, 9)
- Cycle 21: (6, 5, 9, 6)
- Cycle 22: (5, 9, 4, 5)
- Cycle 23: (9, 4, 3, 9)
- Cycle 24: (4, 3, 2, 4)
- Cycle 25: (3, 2, 1, 3)
- Cycle 26: (2, 1, 6, 2)
- Cycle 27: (1, 6, 0, 1)
- Cycle 28: (6, 0, 2, 6)
- Cycle 29: (0, 2, 3, 0)
- Cycle 30: (2, 3, 5, 2)
- Cycle 31: (3, 5, 6, 3)
- Cycle 32: (5, 6, 9, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <5, (3, 6), 9>
- <9, (1, 8), 6>
- <1, (2, 8), 6>
- <6, (3, 5), 9>
- <5, (3, 4), 6>
- <3, (2, 9), 4>
- <4, (6, 8), 9>
- <9, (1, 6), 8>
- <8, (1, 9), 7>
- <1, (6, 8), 7>
- <6, (2, 3), 1>
- <2, (3, 6), 4>
- <3, (2, 6), 5>
- <2, (1, 4), 6>
- <1, (0, 8), 6>
- <0, (1, 2), 6>
- <1, (4, 8), 0>
- <4, (6, 9), 8>
- <9, (4, 5), 6>
- <6, (4, 5), 9>
- <5, (4, 9), 6>
- <9, (3, 4), 5>
- <4, (9, 3), 2>
- <3, (2, 5), 4>
- <2, (1, 6), 3>
- <1, (0, 6), 2>
- <0, (2, 3), 6>
- <2, (3, 5), 0>
- <3, (5, 6), 2>
- <5, (6, 9), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 32 cycles found, and 32 of them have exactly one chord.
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [32].
