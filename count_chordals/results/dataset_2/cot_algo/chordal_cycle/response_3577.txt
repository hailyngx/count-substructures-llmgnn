Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The following chordal 4-cycles are found:
1. <8, (4, 13), 14)>
2. <8, (0, 6), 4)>
3. <8, (3, 14), 4)>
4. <8, (1, 7), 14)>
5. <13, (5, 12), 14)>
6. <7, (2, 5), 0)>
7. <12, (4, 6), 14)>
8. <9, (1, 11), 14)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As all cycles listed above are chordal, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
