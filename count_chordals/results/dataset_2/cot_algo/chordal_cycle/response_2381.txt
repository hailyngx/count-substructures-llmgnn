Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 11, 24, 3, 26, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 2, 17, 21, 26, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 26, 21, 22, 17, 2, 5>
- Cycle 5: <9, 7, 23, 1, 10, 18, 16, 14, 3, 24, 11, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 7, 23, 8, 28, 26, 21, 17, 2, 5, 11, 9>
- Cycle 7: <9, 11, 24, 3, 14, 16, 18, 10, 1, 23, 7, 9>
- Cycle 8: <7, 9, 11, 24, 13, 18, 10, 1, 23, 8, 28, 7>
- Cycle 9: <26, 3, 14, 16, 18, 10, 20, 21, 17, 2, 26>
- Cycle 10: <26, 5, 2, 17, 21, 20, 19, 28, 8, 23, 26>
- Cycle 11: <26, 21, 22, 17, 2, 5, 11, 24, 12, 3, 26>
- Cycle 12: <28, 8, 23, 7, 6, 25, 27, 13, 18, 10, 20, 28>
- Cycle 13: <21, 26, 28, 19, 20, 10, 18, 16, 14, 3, 24, 21>
  
Step 2:
- Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
  - <5, 9, 7, 6, 5> has one chord: (9, 7)
  - <5, 11, 24, 3, 26, 5> has one chord: (11, 24)
  - <5, 2, 17, 21, 26, 5> has one chord: (2, 21)
  - <9, 7, 23, 1, 10, 18, 16, 14, 3, 24, 11, 9> has one chord: (10, 18)
  - <26, 3, 14, 16, 18, 10, 20, 21, 17, 2, 26> has one chord: (3, 14)
  - <26, 21, 22, 17, 2, 5, 11, 24, 12, 3, 26> has one chord: (5, 24)
  
Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 9, 7, 6> with chord (9, 7)
<5, 11, 24, 3> with chord (11, 24)
<5, 2, 17, 21> with chord (2, 21)
<9, 7, 23, 1> with chord (10, 18)
<26, 3, 14, 16> with chord (3, 14)
<26, 21, 22, 17> with chord (5, 24)
