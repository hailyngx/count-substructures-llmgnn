Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-2-9-3-0
- Cycle 2: 4-8-3-7-4
- Cycle 3: 5-7-8-6-5
- Cycle 4: 1-2-5-7-1
- Cycle 5: 2-4-8-6-2

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, 9>
- Cycle 2: <3, 7>
- Cycle 3: <5, 8>
- Cycle 4: <2, 7>
- Cycle 5: <2, 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

The graph does not contain any chordal 4-cycles.
