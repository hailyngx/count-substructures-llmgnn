Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 8, 7, 6)
- Cycle 2: (4, 9, 8, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 2, 4)
- Cycle 4: (8, 2, 4, 0, 8)
- Cycle 5: (4, 0, 5, 4)
- Cycle 6: (0, 5, 2, 0)
- Cycle 7: (5, 2, 8, 5)
- Cycle 8: (8, 7, 6, 9, 8)
- Cycle 9: (6, 7, 0, 6)
- Cycle 10: (0, 7, 8, 0)
- Cycle 11: (2, 8, 3, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 3, 0, 2)
- Cycle 13: (0, 3, 8, 0)
- Cycle 14: (3, 8, 4, 3)
- Cycle 15: (8, 4, 9, 8)
- Cycle 16: (9, 4, 0, 9)
- Cycle 17: (9, 8, 7, 9)
- Cycle 18: (7, 0, 1, 7)
- Cycle 19: (0, 1, 5, 0)
- Cycle 20: (1, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 21: (5, 0, 6, 5)
- Cycle 22: (6, 0, 4, 6)
- Cycle 23: (0, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 24: (4, 9, 6, 4)
- Cycle 25: (9, 6, 7, 9)
- Cycle 26: (6, 7, 8, 6)
- Cycle 27: (7, 8, 9, 7)
- Cycle 28: (8, 9, 4, 8)
- Cycle 29: (8, 4, 0, 8)
- Cycle 30: (4, 0, 3, 4)
- Cycle 31: (0, 3, 2, 0)
- Cycle 32: (3, 2, 5, 3)
- Cycle 33: (2, 5, 0, 2)
- Cycle 34: (5, 0, 1, 5)
- Cycle 35: (0, 1, 6, 0)
- Cycle 36: (1, 6, 7, 1)
- Cycle 37: (6, 7, 8, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <1, (6, 7), 8>
- <2, (8, 4), 0>
- <3, (3, 8), 2>
- <4, (2, 4), 8>
- <5, (5, 0), 2>
- <6, (2, 5), 0>
- <7, (6, 7), 8>
- <8, (6, 7), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles present in the given graph, so the final count is [8].
