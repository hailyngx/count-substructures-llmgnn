Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 17) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (14, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 19) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 18) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 2) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 16) (6, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 4) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 1) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (3, 10, 4, 1, 5, 9, 7) 
        - Cycle 2: (15, 17, 14, 11, 6) 
        - Cycle 3: (15, 17, 0, 2, 8, 14) 
        - Cycle 4: (15, 0, 2, 12, 13, 11, 14) 
        - Cycle 5: (5, 1, 2, 8, 14) 
        - Cycle 6: (5, 1, 2, 12, 13, 11, 14) 
        - Cycle 7: (5, 9, 7, 9) 
        - Cycle 8: (5, 9, 7, 9, 5) 
        - Cycle 9: (5, 14, 11, 6, 11) 

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 1 has no chords.
        - Cycle 2 has no chords.
        - Cycle 3 has the chord (2, 8).
        - Cycle 4 has the chord (13, 14).
        - Cycle 5 has no chords.
        - Cycle 6 has the chord (2, 13).
        - Cycle 7 has no chords.
        - Cycle 8 has no chords.
        - Cycle 9 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<3, 10, 4, 1, (5, 9), 7>
<15, 17, 14, 11, 6>
<5, 1, 2, 8, 14>
<5, 9, 7, 9>
<5, 14, 11, 6>
