Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 15) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (19, 4) (19, 10) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 7) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 16) (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 9) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) (15, 8) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 19) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 18) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 2-8-15-2
- Cycle 2: 5-13-12-4
- Cycle 3: 5-17-7-2
- Cycle 4: 5-17-13-12
- Cycle 5: 13-12-6-14
- Cycle 6: 13-9-11-14
- Cycle 7: 19-4-12-6
- Cycle 8: 19-4-9-11
- Cycle 9: 17-13-9-7
- Cycle 10: 4-12-0-11
- Cycle 11: 14-6-12-0
- Cycle 12: 14-6-13-10
- Cycle 13: 3-5-17-7
- Cycle 14: 7-17-13-9
- Cycle 15: 9-13-16-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (8, 15), 2>
- <2, (13, 12), 4>
- <3, (5, 17), 7>
- <4, (13, 12), 17>
- <5, (12, 6), 14>
- <6, (9, 11), 13>
- <7, (4, 12), 6>
- <8, (11, 9), 4>
- <9, (13, 9), 7>
- <10, (12, 0), 4>
- <11, (14, 6), 12>
- <12, (13, 6), 10>
- <13, (5, 17), 7>
- <14, (13, 9), 17>
- <15, (15, 8), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 15 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [15].
