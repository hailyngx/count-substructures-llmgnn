- Cycle 3 has chord <1, 22>
- Cycle 4 has chord <1, 22>
- Cycle 5 has chord <1, 22>
- Cycle 6 has chord <1, 22>

- Cycle 11 has chord <1, 23>
- Cycle 12 has chord <1, 23>
- Cycle 13 has chord <1, 23>
- Cycle 14 has chord <1, 23>
- Cycle 15 has chord <1, 23>
- Cycle 16 has chord <1, 23>
- Cycle 17 has chord <1, 22>
- Cycle 18 has chord <1, 22>

- Cycle 34 has chord <12, 29>
- Cycle 35 has chord <12, 29>
- Cycle 36 has chord <12, 29>
- Cycle 37 has chord <4, 29>
- Cycle 38 has chord <1, 23>
- Cycle 39 has chord <1, 23>
- Cycle 40 has chord <1, 23>
- Cycle 41 has chord <12, 29>
- Cycle 42 has chord <12, 29>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
