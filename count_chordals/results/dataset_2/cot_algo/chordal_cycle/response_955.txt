This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 3) (26, 16) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 15) (22, 18) (22, 5) (22, 25) (0, 20) (0, 19) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 4) (20, 28) (17, 29) (17, 13) (29, 17) (29, 1) (5, 22) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 28) (8, 7) (28, 20) (28, 8) (28, 15) (1, 29) (1, 24) (1, 27) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 19) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 27) (2, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 25) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 6) (15, 18) (15, 28) (15, 14) (15, 12) (23, 25) (23, 16) (21, 27) (21, 12) (27, 1) (27, 7) (27, 21) (27, 11) (25, 22) (25, 13) (25, 14) (25, 23) (25, 16) (24, 1) (24, 7) (10, 18) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 27) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 20) (4, 11) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 are:
- Cycle 1: <1, 27, 21, 12, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 27, 21, 12, 15, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 27, 11, 5, 12, 21, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 27, 11, 5, 12, 21, 27, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 27, 11, 5, 12, 21, 27, 7, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 27, 7, 3, 9, 8, 28, 15, 12, 21, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 27, 7, 3, 9, 8, 28, 20, 0, 19, 6, 12, 21, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 27, 7, 3, 9, 8, 28, 20, 4, 11, 5, 12, 21, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 27, 7, 3, 9, 8, 5, 11, 4, 20, 28, 15, 12, 21, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 27, 7, 8, 9, 3, 19, 0, 20, 28, 15, 12, 21, 1>
- Cycle 11: <1, 29, 17, 13, 2, 13, 5, 11, 4, 20, 28, 15, 12, 21, 1>
- Cycle 12: <1, 29, 17, 13, 2, 13, 5, 11, 4, 20, 0, 19, 6, 12, 21, 1>
- Cycle 13: <1, 29, 17, 13, 25, 14, 18, 22, 25, 23, 16, 26, 16, 25, 13, 2, 13, 5, 11, 4, 20, 28, 15, 12, 21, 1>
- Cycle 14: <4, 11, 5, 13, 17, 29, 1, 27, 21, 12, 6, 19, 0, 20, 28, 15, 12>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- For Cycle 1, no chord exists.
- For Cycle 2, no chord exists.
- For Cycle 3, the chord is (5, 21).
- For Cycle 4, the chord is (5, 21).
- For Cycle 5, the chord is (5, 21).
- For Cycle 6, the chord is (9, 27).
- For Cycle 7, the chord is (9, 27).
- For Cycle 8, the chord is (9, 27).
- For Cycle 9, the chord is (9, 27).
- For Cycle 10, the chord is (9, 27).
- For Cycle 11, the chord is (8, 7).
- For Cycle 12, the chord is (8, 7).
- For Cycle 13, no chord exists.
- For Cycle 14, the chord is (6, 12).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 10 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
