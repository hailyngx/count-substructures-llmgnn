Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 7, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 9, 2, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 9, 3, 0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 5, 9, 3, 2)
- Cycle 5: (3, 0, 4, 9, 3)
- Cycle 6: (4, 7, 5, 9, 4)
- Cycle 7: (6, 7, 0, 3, 6)
- Cycle 8: (7, 1, 8, 5, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 4, 9, 3, 7)
- Cycle 10: (8, 1, 5, 9, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (9, 2).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (9, 3).
- Cycle 4 has a chord (5, 3).
- Cycle 5 has no chords.
- Cycle 6 has no chords.
- Cycle 7 has no chords.
- Cycle 8 has a chord (1, 8).
- Cycle 9 has a chord (4, 9).
- Cycle 10 has a chord (5, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:

- <1, (5, 9), 2>
- <1, (5, 9), 3>
- <5, (2, 3), 9>
- <7, 4, 9, 3, 7>
- <8, (1, 5), 9>
