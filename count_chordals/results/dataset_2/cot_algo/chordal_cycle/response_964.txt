Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 22) (9, 2) (9, 20) (9, 23) (0, 28) (0, 21) (27, 14) (27, 11) (27, 20) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 6) (4, 1) (18, 24) (21, 0) (21, 17) (28, 0) (28, 2) (24, 18) (24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 8) (26, 24) (26, 16) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 16) (3, 13) (11, 27) (11, 22) (11, 25) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 23) (20, 9) (20, 27) (20, 29) (12, 16) (12, 25) (12, 22) (12, 15) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 12) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 15) (15, 12) (15, 7) (15, 2) (6, 29) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (14, 27) (14, 6) (14, 22) (22, 5) (22, 11) (22, 12) (22, 14) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 15) (2, 25) (8, 24) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 6) (23, 9) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 1) (25, 11) (25, 12) (25, 2) (25, 23) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 23) 

Response:
Step 1:  
Below are the cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 28 - 2 - 9 - 20 - 27 - 11 - 25 - 23
- Cycle 2: 3 - 17 - 29 - 6 - 14 - 27 - 20 - 9 - 2 - 15
- Cycle 3: 3 - 17 - 10 - 7 - 19 - 23 - 25 - 2 - 28 - 0

Step 2:  
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 2, 9, 27> has a chord (9, 27).
- <3, 17, 29, 6> has a chord (17, 6).
- <3, 17, 10, 19> has a chord (17, 10).

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 2, 9, 27>
- <3, 17, 29, 6>
- <3, 17, 10, 19>
