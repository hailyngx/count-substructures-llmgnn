Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 8, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 4, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 3, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (6, 4, 0, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 7, 2, 6)
- Cycle 8: (0, 4, 2, 0)
- Cycle 9: (7, 1, 2, 7)
- Cycle 10: (7, 5, 8, 7)
- Cycle 11: (8, 3, 4, 8)
- Cycle 12: (2, 4, 6, 2)
- Cycle 13: (3, 5, 9, 3)
- Cycle 14: (4, 6, 0, 4)
- Cycle 15: (1, 2, 7, 1)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (5, 7), 5>
- <2, (3, 4), 9>
- <3, (7, 8), 5>
- <4, (5, 9), 4>
- <5, (3, 4), 9>
- <6, (4, 6), 0>
- <7, (6, 2), 7>
- <8, (0, 2), 4>
- <9, (1, 2), 7>
- <10, (5, 8), 7>
- <11, (3, 4), 8>
- <12, (2, 6), 4>
- <13, (5, 9), 3>
- <14, (4, 0), 6>
- <15, (2, 7), 1>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [15].
