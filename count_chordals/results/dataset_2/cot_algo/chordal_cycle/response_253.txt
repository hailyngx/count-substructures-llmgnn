Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 23) (16, 26) (15, 27) (15, 6) (15, 25) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 1) (20, 27) (20, 25) (20, 23) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 10) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 25) (12, 7) (12, 29) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 10) (1, 27) (1, 19) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 22) (21, 0) (28, 14) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 24) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 17) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 29) (19, 1) (19, 22) (23, 16) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 0) (2, 11) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (14, 28) (14, 3) (14, 8) (24, 15) (24, 22) (24, 29) (0, 21) (0, 23) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 10) (29, 12) (29, 3) (29, 23) (29, 24) (10, 25) (10, 7) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 9) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:

Cycle 1: <11, 16, 26, 11>
Cycle 2: <15, 27, 1, 19, 22, 26, 16, 23, 20, 25, 15>
Cycle 3: <7, 18, 10, 22, 26, 11, 13, 17, 9, 7>
Cycle 4: <7, 18, 4, 6, 15, 25, 12, 7>
Cycle 5: <3, 17, 13, 7, 12, 25, 20, 23, 29, 3>
Cycle 6: <5, 2, 11, 13, 7, 18, 4, 6, 0, 23, 29, 3, 14, 8, 5>
Cycle 7: <1, 27, 15, 25, 10, 22, 24, 29, 23, 0, 6, 4, 18, 10, 9, 17, 3, 14, 28, 21, 0, 23>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycle is:
<15, 25, 12, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is one unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
