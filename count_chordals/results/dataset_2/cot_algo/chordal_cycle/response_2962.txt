Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 14) (16, 5) (5, 16) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 19) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 29) (13, 15) (20, 21) (20, 3) (20, 14) (25, 7) (25, 18) (28, 10) (28, 2) (29, 13) (22, 16) (22, 27) (22, 10) (22, 24) (26, 24) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 7) (3, 20) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (24, 22) (24, 26) (7, 25) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 18) (15, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 23) (27, 22) (27, 19) (17, 8) (17, 26) (17, 1) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 23) (21, 20) (21, 26) (21, 14) (23, 12) (23, 0) (23, 6) (14, 16) (14, 20) (14, 21) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 18) (18, 25) (18, 3) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 6) (2, 28) (2, 7) (2, 4) (6, 4) (6, 23) (6, 18) (6, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 27) (19, 6) 

Response:
Step 1:  
One of the cycles of length 4 in the graph is <11, 16, 22, 24>.

Step 2:  
Checking the cycle <11, 16, 22, 24> for exactly one chord:
- Adding chord (10, 26) creates a chordal 4-cycle <11, 16, 22, 24> with one chord <10, 26>.

Step 3:  
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle is <11, 16, 22, 24> with one chord <10, 26>.
