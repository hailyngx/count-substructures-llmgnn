Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 0, 9, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (6, 1, 7, 5, 6)
- Cycle 3: (4, 1, 7, 9, 4)
- Cycle 4: (6, 1, 0, 8, 6)
- Cycle 5: (2, 6, 8, 0, 2)
- Cycle 6: (3, 6, 8, 0, 9, 3)
- Cycle 7: (7, 5, 2, 6, 7)
- Cycle 8: (8, 0, 1, 4, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (0, 9), 7, 4, 1> has the chord (0, 9)
- <2, (6, 8), 0, 2> has the chord (6, 8)
- <6, (8, 9), 3> has the chord (8, 9)
- <7, (5, 2), 6> has the chord (5, 2)
- <8, (4, 1), 7> has the chord (4, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are [5] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
