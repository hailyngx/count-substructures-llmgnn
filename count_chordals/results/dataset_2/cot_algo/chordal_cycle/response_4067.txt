Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-2-7-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-4-7-3-5
- Cycle 3: 5-3-7-4-1-5
- Cycle 4: 7-3-6-5-1-7
- Cycle 5: 4-1-7-8-2-4
- Cycle 6: 9-2-8-4-1-9
- Cycle 7: 6-3-0-8-2-6
- Cycle 8: 0-8-7-1-3-0

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 2 has chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 3 has chord (3, 7)
- Cycle 4 has chord (3, 5)
- Cycle 5 has chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 6 has chord (2, 4)
- Cycle 7 has chord (3, 8)
- Cycle 8 has chord (1, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5-9-2-7-4-5, (9, 7)>
<5-1-4-7-3-5, (1, 4)>
<5-3-7-4-1-5, (3, 7)>
<7-3-6-5-1-7, (3, 5)>
<4-1-7-8-2-4, (1, 7)>
<9-2-8-4-1-9, (2, 4)>
<6-3-0-8-2-6, (3, 8)>
<0-8-7-1-3-0, (1, 7)>
