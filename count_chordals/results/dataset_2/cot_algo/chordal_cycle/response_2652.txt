Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 14) (6, 15) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 17) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 16) (7, 2) (16, 5) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 7) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 0) (17, 9) (17, 3) (11, 5) (11, 1) (19, 16) (19, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
  - There are two 4-cycles in the given graph: 
    1. Cycle 1: (5, 15, 7, 16) 
    2. Cycle 2: (8, 14, 4, 13)

Step 2:
  - Checking for chords in each cycle:
    1. For cycle 1 (5, 15, 7, 16) there is a chord (15, 7).
    2. For cycle 2 (8, 14, 4, 13) there is a chord (14, 4).

Step 3:
  - As there is only one chord in each cycle, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
  <1, (15, 7), 16>
  <2, (14, 4), 13>
