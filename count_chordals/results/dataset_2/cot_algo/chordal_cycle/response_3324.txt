Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-5-6-4-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-5-6-1-0
        - Cycle 3: 0-7-2-3-0
        - Cycle 4: 4-5-6-1-4
        - Cycle 5: 4-3-7-2-4
        - Cycle 6: 4-0-7-3-4
        - Cycle 7: 4-3-2-1-4
        - Cycle 8: 5-6-1-2-5
        - Cycle 9: 5-0-7-8-5
        - Cycle 10: 6-5-4-3-6
        - Cycle 11: 6-1-2-7-6
        - Cycle 12: 6-8-9-2-6
        - Cycle 13: 7-0-5-4-7
        - Cycle 14: 7-3-2-1-7
        - Cycle 15: 7-2-9-8-7
        - Cycle 16: 8-7-0-5-8
        - Cycle 17: 8-9-2-1-8
        - Cycle 18: 9-8-7-3-9
        - Cycle 19: 9-2-1-6-9

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 12: <6, (8, 9), 2>
        - Cycle 16: <8, (5, 9), 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        As there are 19 cycles and 2 of them have exactly one chord, so the number of chordless cycles is 19-2 = 17.

Final Answer: [17]
