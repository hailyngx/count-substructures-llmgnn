Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 12) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 5, 11, 4>, with chords (0, 11)
- <1, 4, 11, 10>, with chords (1, 10)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 5, 11, 4> has one chord: (0, 11)
- <1, 4, 11, 10> has one chord: (1, 10)

Step 3:
Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are <0, 5, 11, 4> and <1, 4, 11, 10>.
