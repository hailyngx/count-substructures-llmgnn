Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 0) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: 3-8-4-13-3 
- Cycle 2: 3-0-7-4-8-3 
- Cycle 3: 3-0-7-11-5-0 
- Cycle 4: 3-0-7-11-9-2-1-13-14-1-0-3 
- Cycle 5: 6-1-13-4-7-0-10-12-6 
- Cycle 6: 6-1-13-4-7-11-9-2-1-6 
- Cycle 7: 6-1-13-4-8-12-0-7-9-6 
- Cycle 8: 6-1-13-14-7-11-5-10-12-6 
- Cycle 9: 6-1-2-9-7-0-10-12-6 
- Cycle 10: 6-1-2-9-7-11-5-10-12-6 
- Cycle 11: 9-2-1-13-4-7-0-3-8-9 
- Cycle 12: 9-2-1-13-4-8-12-10-5-11-9 
- Cycle 13: 9-2-1-13-14-7-0-3-8-9 
- Cycle 14: 9-2-1-6-12-0-7-4-13-9 
- Cycle 15: 9-2-1-6-12-10-5-11-7-4-9 

Step 2: 
From the list of cycles above, we find the following chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <7, (0, 4), 8> (3-0-7-4-8-3) 
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, (1, 13), 9> (6-1-13-4-7-0-10-12-6) 
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, (1, 13), 9> (6-1-13-4-7-11-9-2-1-6) 
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (2, 1), 7> (9-2-1-13-4-7-0-3-8-9) 
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (2, 1), 6> (9-2-1-6-12-0-7-4-13-9) 

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the count is [5].
