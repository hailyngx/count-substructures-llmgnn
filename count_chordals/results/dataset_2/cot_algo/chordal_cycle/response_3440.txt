Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 7 - 1 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 2 - 4 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 3: 1 - 7 - 8 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 4: 2 - 9 - 5 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 5: 3 - 4 - 5 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 6: 3 - 9 - 2 - 8 - 3

Step 2: Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has <2, 5> as the chord: 2 - 5.
- Cycle 5 has <4, 8> as the chord: 4 - 8.
- Cycle 6 has <9, 2> as the chord: 9 - 2.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
We found 3 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. Cycle 4: <2, 5, 9, 6>
2. Cycle 5: <4, 8, 5, 3>
3. Cycle 6: <9, 2, 8, 3>
