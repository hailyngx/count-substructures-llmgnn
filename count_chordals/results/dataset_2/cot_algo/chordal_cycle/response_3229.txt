Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 14) (2, 13) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 5, 12)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 7, 10)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 12, 10)
- Cycle 4: (3, 5, 12, 10)
- Cycle 5: (3, 7, 10, 12)
- Cycle 6: (5, 12, 10, 7)
- Cycle 7: (3, 8, 11, 14)
- Cycle 8: (5, 8, 11, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 8, 0, 11)
- Cycle 10: (5, 8, 6, 12)
- Cycle 11: (0, 8, 9, 12)
- Cycle 12: (0, 8, 11, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, (3, 12), 5> (Cycle 1 with chord 3-12)
2. <1, (3, 10), 7> (Cycle 2 with chord 3-10)
3. <1, (5, 10), 12> (Cycle 3 with chord 5-10)
4. <3, (5, 12), 10> (Cycle 4 with chord 5-12)
5. <3, (7, 10), 12> (Cycle 5 with chord 7-10)
6. <5, (7, 12), 10> (Cycle 6 with chord 7-12)
7. <3, (8, 11), 14> (Cycle 7 with chord 8-11)
8. <3, (5, 8), 11> (Cycle 8 with chord 5-8)
9. <3, (8, 11), 0> (Cycle 9 with chord 8-11)
10. <5, (8, 12), 6> (Cycle 10 with chord 8-12)
11. <0, (8, 12), 9> (Cycle 11 with chord 8-12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [11].
