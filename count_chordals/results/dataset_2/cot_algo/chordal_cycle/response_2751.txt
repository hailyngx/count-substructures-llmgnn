Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 8: (0, 4, 12, 13) [<0, (4, 12), 13>]
- Cycle 26: (0, 18, 4, 12) [<0, (4, 12), 18>]
- Cycle 27: (1, 18, 4, 13) [<1, (4, 13), 18>]

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = [165].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, (4, 12), 13>
- <0, (4, 12), 18>
- <1, (4, 13), 18>
