Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 9) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (1, 4, 8, 5, 1)
- (2, 4, 13, 0, 2)
- (3, 4, 13, 0, 3)
- (7, 4, 13, 0, 7)
- (9, 10, 5, 8, 9)
- (9, 10, 1, 5, 8, 9)
- (9, 10, 1, 4, 13, 0, 9)
- (9, 10, 1, 4, 13, 8, 9)
- (9, 10, 1, 8, 12, 2, 9)
- (9, 10, 5, 8, 12, 2, 9)
- (9, 12, 7, 4, 13, 0, 9)
- (9, 12, 7, 4, 13, 8, 9)
- (9, 12, 7, 4, 1, 8, 9)
- (9, 12, 7, 4, 1, 10, 9)
- (9, 12, 2, 6, 14, 9)
- (9, 12, 8, 1, 10, 9)
- (9, 14, 6, 2, 12, 9)
- (9, 14, 6, 0, 3, 12, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <9, (10, 5), 8, 1>
- <9, (10, 1), 4, 13>
- <9, (12, 7), 4, 13>
- <9, (12, 7), 4, 1>
- <9, (12, 2), 6, 14>
- <9, (14, 6), 2, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [6].
