Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
1. Cycle <0, 4, 1, 2, 0>
2. Cycle <0, 7, 3, 0>
3. Cycle <0, 2, 1, 8, 6, 4, 0>
4. Cycle <0, 2, 8, 1, 4, 3, 0>
5. Cycle <0, 3, 4, 6, 2, 0>
6. Cycle <1, 4, 6, 2, 1>
7. Cycle <2, 5, 9, 6, 2>
8. Cycle <2, 9, 0, 7, 3, 6, 2>
9. Cycle <3, 4, 1, 2, 3>
10. Cycle <6, 9, 2, 5, 6>
11. Cycle <6, 8, 1, 4, 6>
12. Cycle <6, 2, 0, 9, 6>
13. Cycle <6, 2, 8, 1, 6>
14. Cycle <6, 3, 7, 0, 6>
15. Cycle <9, 5, 2, 6, 9>

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 4, 1, 2, 0> has a chord 1-4 (edges (1,4))
- <0, 7, 3, 0> has a chord 3-7 (edges (3,7))
- <0, 2, 8, 1, 4, 3, 0> has a chord 1-8 (edges (1,8))
- <6, 9, 2, 5, 6> has a chord 2-9 (edges (2,9))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [11]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<0, 4, 1, 2, 0>, <0, 7, 3, 0>, <0, 2, 8, 1, 4, 3, 0>, <6, 9, 2, 5, 6>
