- Cycle 5: (0, 4, 29, 10)
- Cycle 6: (0, 14, 5, 3)
- Cycle 7: (0, 14, 5, 20)
- Cycle 8: (1, 6, 27, 21)
- Cycle 9: (2, 6, 27, 21)
- Cycle 10: (2, 6, 27, 22)
- Cycle 11: (2, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 12: (4, 18, 16, 22)
- Cycle 13: (4, 18, 25, 7)
- Cycle 14: (4, 29, 10, 0)
- Cycle 15: (4, 29, 18, 25)
- Cycle 16: (5, 14, 12, 16)
- Cycle 17: (5, 14, 12, 17)
- Cycle 18: (5, 14, 0, 1)
- Cycle 19: (5, 20, 15, 21)

- Cycle 21: (6, 27, 21, 15)
- Cycle 22: (6, 27, 22, 7)
- Cycle 23: (6, 27, 8, 16)
- Cycle 24: (8, 27, 21, 15)
- Cycle 25: (8, 27, 22, 16)
- Cycle 26: (11, 17, 23, 25)
- Cycle 27: (12, 14, 0, 1)
- Cycle 28: (12, 14, 5, 20)
- Cycle 29: (12, 16, 18, 4)
- Cycle 30: (12, 16, 22, 7)
- Cycle 31: (12, 17, 23, 25)
- Cycle 32: (13, 19, 26, 24)
- Cycle 33: (13, 19, 26, 20)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycles 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 21, 24, 26, 27, 30, 31 have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 13 chordless cycles found. Thus, the final count is [13].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, 1, 9, 11>
- <0, 1, 6, 2>
- <0, 14, 12, 17>
- <0, 14, 5, 20>
- <4, 18, 16, 22>
- <5, 20, 24, 26>
- <6, 27, 21, 15>
- <8, 27, 22, 16>
- <11, 17, 23, 25>
- <13, 19, 26, 24>
