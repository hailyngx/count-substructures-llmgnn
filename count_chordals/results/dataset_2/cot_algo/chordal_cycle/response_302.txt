Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-7-5 
- Cycle 2: 5-9-1-8-5 
- Cycle 3: 5-7-4-9-5 
- Cycle 4: 5-1-9-4-5 
- Cycle 5: 5-0-7-6-5 
- Cycle 6: 5-1-8-0-5 
- Cycle 7: 9-4-7-6-9 
- Cycle 8: 9-1-8-0-9 
- Cycle 9: 4-7-6-0-4 
- Cycle 10: 7-5-9-1-7 
- Cycle 11: 7-4-9-1-7 
- Cycle 12: 7-0-6-9-7 
- Cycle 13: 6-7-4-1-6 
- Cycle 14: 6-2-3-8-6 

Step 2: 
Out of the cycles listed above, the cycles with exactly one chord are: 
- <5, 9, 4, 7> with chord (5, 7) 
- <5, 9, 1, 8> with chord (1, 9) 
- <5, 7, 4, 9> with chord (4, 7) 
- <5, 1, 9, 4> with chord (1, 9) 
- <5, 0, 7 ,6> with chord (0, 7) 
- <5, 1, 8, 0> with chord (1, 8) 
- <9, 4, 7, 6> with chord (4, 7) 
- <9, 1, 8, 0> with chord (1, 8) 
- <4, 7, 6, 0> with chord (4, 7) 
- <7, 5, 9, 1> with chord (5, 9) 
- <7, 4, 9, 1> with chord (4, 7) 
- <7, 0, 6, 9> with chord (0, 7) 
- <6, 7, 4, 1> with chord (4, 7) 
- <6, 2, 3, 8> with chord (3, 8) 

Step 3: 
Counting the chordal 4-cycles found, we have a total of [14].
