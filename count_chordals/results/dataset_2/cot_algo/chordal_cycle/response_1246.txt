Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 25) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 15) (3, 29) (25, 11) (25, 6) (25, 8) (8, 16) (8, 25) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 20) (13, 28) (12, 1) (12, 26) (27, 10) (27, 28) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 17) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 28) (26, 12) (26, 1) (26, 20) (26, 29) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 20) (20, 13) (20, 26) (20, 17) (4, 14) (4, 21) (29, 3) (29, 26) (29, 22) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 24) (23, 19) (5, 18) (5, 10) (19, 23) (19, 0) (6, 25) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 15) (21, 13) (21, 2) (21, 4) (21, 22) (14, 4) (14, 23) (14, 22) (14, 7) (22, 29) (22, 21) (22, 14) (22, 15) (24, 23) (24, 0) (0, 19) (0, 6) (0, 24) (0, 15) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 22) (15, 0) (7, 14) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 5) (28, 13) (28, 27) (28, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in this graph. 

<11, 25, 8, 16> 
<1, 12, 26, 20> 
<16, 8, 25, 6> 
<2, 13, 21, 4> 
<29, 26, 1, 6> 
<22, 29, 3, 5> 
<14, 4, 21, 22> 
<13, 2, 10, 27>
<17, 16, 8, 25>
<20, 13, 21, 4>
<23, 11, 25, 6>
<0, 19, 23, 14>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find that the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- <11, 25, 8, 16> with chord (16, 8)
- <1, 12, 26, 20> with chord (12, 20)
- <16, 8, 25, 6> with chord (8, 25)
- <2, 13, 21, 4> with chord (13, 21)
- <29, 26, 1, 6> with chord (26, 1)
- <22, 29, 3, 5> with chord (29, 3)
- <14, 4, 21, 22> with chord (4, 21)
- <13, 2, 10, 27> with chord (2, 10)
- <17, 16, 8, 25> with chord (16, 8)
- <20, 13, 21, 4> with chord (13, 21)
- <23, 11, 25, 6> with chord (11, 25)
- <0, 19, 23, 14> with chord (19, 23)

Step 3:
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [12].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<11, 25, 8, 16>
<1, 12, 26, 20>
<16, 8, 25, 6>
<2, 13, 21, 4>
<29, 26, 1, 6>
<22, 29, 3, 5>
<14, 4, 21, 22>
<13, 2, 10, 27>
<17, 16, 8, 25>
<20, 13, 21, 4>
<23, 11, 25, 6>
<0, 19, 23, 14>
