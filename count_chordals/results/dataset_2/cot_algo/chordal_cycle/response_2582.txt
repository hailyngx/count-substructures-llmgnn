Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-4-1-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-9-8-12-5
        - Cycle 3: 5-6-2-4-5
        - Cycle 4: 5-6-10-7-5
        - Cycle 5: 9-4-1-13-9
        - Cycle 6: 9-4-7-11-9
        - Cycle 7: 6-10-0-12-6
        - Cycle 8: 1-4-2-11-1
        - Cycle 9: 1-4-7-14-1
        - Cycle 10: 3-14-7-11-3
        - Cycle 11: 8-4-2-11-8
        - Cycle 12: 8-4-7-10-8
        - Cycle 13: 12-0-10-7-12
        - Cycle 14: 14-7-1-13-14
        - Cycle 15: 14-7-10-0-14

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has chord (1, 4)
        - Cycle 2 has chord (8, 12)
        - Cycle 3 has chord (2, 6)
        - Cycle 4 has chord (7, 10)
        - Cycle 5 has chord (1, 13)
        - Cycle 6 has chord (4, 7)
        - Cycle 7 has chord (6, 12)
        - Cycle 8 has chord (2, 11)
        - Cycle 9 has chord (1, 14)
        - Cycle 10 has chord (7, 11)
        - Cycle 11 has chord (2, 11)
        - Cycle 12 has chord (7, 10)
        - Cycle 13 has chord (10, 12)
        - Cycle 14 has chord (1, 13)
        - Cycle 15 has chord (7, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found, thus the final count is [15].

        The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
         <5, (1, 4), 9>
         <5, (8, 12), 9>
         <5, (2, 6), 6>
         <5, (7, 10), 6>
         <9, (1, 13), 4>
         <9, (4, 7), 1>
         <6, (6, 12), 10>
         <1, (2, 11), 4>
         <1, (1, 14), 13>
         <3, (7, 11), 14>
         <8, (2, 11), 4>
         <8, (7, 10), 4>
         <12, (10, 12), 0>
         <14, (1, 13), 7>
         <14, (7, 10), 0>
