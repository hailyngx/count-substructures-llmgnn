Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 15) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 6) (17, 3) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 14) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 18) (9, 2) (3, 12) (3, 17) (3, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 2) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 3) (1, 8) (1, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 10-11-5-8-10
- Cycle 2: 10-13-0-2-9-15-5-10
- Cycle 3: 11-18-16-1-8-5-11
- Cycle 4: 4-8-5-15-9-2-14-19-4
- Cycle 5: 7-12-3-6-15-9-18-11-7
- Cycle 6: 12-7-9-2-0-13-10-5-12
- Cycle 7: 16-18-9-2-14-12-3-17-16
- Cycle 8: 19-4-8-1-16-18-11-5-19

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: Chord (11-8)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: Chord (13-9)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: Chord (18-5)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: Chord (8-15)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: Chord (12-11)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: Chord (12-10)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: Chord (9-14)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: Chord (4-16)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
