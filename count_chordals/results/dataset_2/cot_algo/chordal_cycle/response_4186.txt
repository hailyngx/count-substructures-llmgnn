Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8)

8. <1, 9, (7, 2), 1>
9. <1, 9, 7, (4, 6), 1>
10. <1, 9, 7, 4, (8, 3), 1>
11. <1, 9, (7, 4), 1>
12. <1, 9, 0, (8, 3), 1>
13. <1, 9, (0, 8), 1>
