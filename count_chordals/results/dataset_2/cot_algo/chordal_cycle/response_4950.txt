Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:  
- Cycle 1: (3, 5, 7, 9)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 9, 4)
- Cycle 3: (1, 7, 4, 9)
- Cycle 4: (1, 7, 5, 6)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 7, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 7: (6, 5, 7, 1)
- Cycle 8: (8, 6, 5, 3)

Step 2:  
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, (9, 4), 4>
- <1, 7, (4, 9), 7>
- <1, 7, (5, 6), 4>
- <1, 4, (7, 2), 7>
- <2, 4, (7, 5), 5>
- <6, 5, (7, 1), 6>
- <8, 6, (5, 3), 8>

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
