Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (0, 14) (0, 15) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 7) (15, 0) (15, 1) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (9, 16, 1, 7, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 3, 18, 17, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 7, 1, 15, 9)
- Cycle 4: (16, 3, 9, 7, 16)
- Cycle 5: (1, 15, 0, 14, 1)
- Cycle 6: (0, 14, 5, 19, 0)
- Cycle 7: (14, 5, 10, 13, 14)
- Cycle 8: (17, 18, 4, 11, 17)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (3, 17).
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has a chord (5, 13).
- Cycle 8 has a chord (4, 11).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of 2 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<2, (3, 17)>
<5, 13, (4, 11)>
