Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 0) (15, 3) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 12) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 7) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 12) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 19) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (14, 19) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 3, 15, 4, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 9, 16, 11, 8, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 7, 17, 5, 4, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 7, 6, 9, 12, 10, 4, 5, 18, 16, 11, 8, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 7, 1, 8, 11, 16, 12, 10, 13, 0)
- Cycle 6: (1, 7, 6, 9, 12, 19, 14, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: No chords
- Cycle 2: (8, 11) is the chord
- Cycle 3: (7, 17) is the chord
- Cycle 4: No chords
- Cycle 5: (1, 8) is the chord
- Cycle 6: No chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 6, 9, 16, 11, 8, 0>
<0, 7, 6, 9, 12, 10, 4, 5, 18, 16, 11, 8, 0>
<0, 7, 1, 8, 11, 16, 12, 10, 13, 0>
