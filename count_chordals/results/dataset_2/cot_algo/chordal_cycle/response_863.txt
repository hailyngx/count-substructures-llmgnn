Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 11) (6, 13) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 1-4-8-10-1
        - Cycle 2: 3-7-12-13-3
        - Cycle 3: 3-12-7-5-3
        - Cycle 4: 7-3-13-11-7
        - Cycle 5: 12-3-13-11-12
        - Cycle 6: 0-10-8-4-1-5-0
        - Cycle 7: 0-10-6-13-12-7-5-0
        - Cycle 8: 0-5-7-3-12-9-0
        - Cycle 9: 1-14-2-13-3-7-5-1
        - Cycle 10: 1-14-2-11-13-6-10-8-4-1
        - Cycle 11: 1-14-2-11-5-7-12-9-0-10-6-1
        - Cycle 12: 1-14-10-0-9-11-2-1

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 1 has no chord.
        - Cycle 2 has no chord.
        - Cycle 3 has no chords.
        - Cycle 4 has no chords.
        - Cycle 5 has no chords.
        - Cycle 6 has one chord: <6, 13>.
        - Cycle 7 has one chord: <0, 12>.
        - Cycle 8 has one chord: <0, 12>.
        - Cycle 9 has one chord: <1, 7>.
        - Cycle 10 has one chord: <6, 10>.
        - Cycle 11 has one chord: <2, 11>.
        - Cycle 12 has one chord: <9, 11>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless 4-cycles:
        There are 5 chordless 4-cycles: Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, and Cycle 5.

Therefore, the final count is [5]. The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        - Cycle 1: 1-4-8-10-1
        - Cycle 2: 3-7-12-13-3
        - Cycle 3: 3-12-7-5-3
        - Cycle 4: 7-3-13-11-7
        - Cycle 5: 12-3-13-11-12
