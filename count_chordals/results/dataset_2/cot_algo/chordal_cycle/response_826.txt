Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 3) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 13) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 13) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 0, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 2, 14, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 2, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 11, 7, 14, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 11, 6, 13, 5)
- Cycle 6: (9, 13, 6, 10, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 13, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 0, 2, 14, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 0, 9, 13, 4)
- Cycle 10: (8, 2, 0, 4, 8)
- Cycle 11: (8, 2, 14, 10, 8)
- Cycle 12: (8, 11, 7, 14, 8)
- Cycle 13: (8, 11, 6, 13, 8)
- Cycle 14: (7, 14, 10, 1, 7)
- Cycle 15: (12, 6, 1, 7, 12)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (4, 9), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (4, 14), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (8, 4), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (11, 7), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (11, 6), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, (13, 10), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, (13, 1), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, (0, 2), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (0, 9), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <8, (2, 0), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <8, (2, 14), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <8, (11, 7), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <8, (11, 6), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <7, (14, 10), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <12, (6, 1), 7>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [15].
