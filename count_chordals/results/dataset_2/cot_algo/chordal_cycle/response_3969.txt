Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 8) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 6) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 7) (18, 2) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (19, 9) (19, 14) (15, 4) (15, 14) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 7-13-2-18-7
- Cycle 2: 10-13-2-18-10
- Cycle 3: 6-1-10-13-6
- Cycle 4: 14-15-4-1-14

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (13, 18)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (13, 18)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (1, 13)
- Cycle 4 is chordless.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<14, 15, 4, 1>
