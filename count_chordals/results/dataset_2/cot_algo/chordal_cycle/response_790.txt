Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 10) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 12) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 17) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 19) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 14) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 14) (0, 10) (16, 4) (16, 3) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 19) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 18 - 2 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 10 - 0 - 13 - 4
- Cycle 3: 5 - 9 - 10 - 13 - 18 - 2
- Cycle 4: 5 - 9 - 18 - 13 - 4 - 15
- Cycle 5: 5 - 15 - 14 - 19 - 17 - 6
- Cycle 6: 4 - 7 - 6 - 17 - 2 - 3
- Cycle 7: 4 - 15 - 14 - 19 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 8: 4 - 15 - 14 - 11 - 3 - 1

Step 2: 
Only Cycle 7: 4 - 15 - 14 - 19 - 8 - 9 has exactly one chord, which is the edge (8, 9).

Step 3:
As Cycle 7 is the only chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, 15, 14, 19, (8, 9)>
