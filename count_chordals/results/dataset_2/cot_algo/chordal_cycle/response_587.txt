Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 22) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 22) (3, 25) (3, 2) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 15) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 5) (10, 29) (11, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 28) (27, 29) (27, 14) (0, 23) (14, 7) (14, 27) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 23) (2, 13) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 18) (13, 2) (26, 25) (26, 21) (1, 17) (1, 24) (1, 23) (17, 12) (17, 1) (17, 20) (17, 5) (16, 25) (16, 28) (16, 9) (16, 19) (28, 12) (28, 16) (28, 19) (28, 5) (20, 17) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 29) (9, 21) (9, 19) (29, 10) (29, 27) (29, 9) (21, 10) (21, 26) (21, 9) (21, 22) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 23) (6, 22) (24, 8) (24, 1) (22, 4) (22, 7) (22, 21) (22, 6) (15, 25) (15, 19) (19, 16) (19, 28) (19, 9) (19, 15) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 18) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: {4, 7, 22, 4}
- Cycle 2: {4, 9, 16, 25, 4}
- Cycle 3: {7, 14, 27, 29, 7}
- Cycle 4: {7, 18, 23, 2, 7}
- Cycle 5: {3, 25, 16, 28, 3}
- Cycle 6: {3, 8, 24, 1, 3}
- Cycle 7: {25, 26, 21, 9, 25}
- Cycle 8: {25, 3, 2, 23, 25}
- Cycle 9: {10, 11, 21, 26, 10}
- Cycle 10: {10, 5, 17, 12, 10}
- Cycle 11: {11, 10, 21, 26, 11}
- Cycle 12: {12, 2, 23, 1, 12}
- Cycle 13: {12, 5, 28, 16, 12}
- Cycle 14: {12, 17, 1, 24, 12}
- Cycle 15: {27, 29, 9, 21, 27}
- Cycle 16: {27, 14, 7, 4, 27}
- Cycle 17: {0, 23, 2, 3, 0}
- Cycle 18: {2, 3, 8, 24, 2}
- Cycle 19: {2, 12, 17, 5, 2}
- Cycle 20: {2, 23, 1, 24, 2}
- Cycle 21: {8, 3, 25, 16, 8}
- Cycle 22: {8, 18, 23, 1, 8}
- Cycle 23: {13, 2, 23, 1, 13}
- Cycle 24: {21, 10, 11, 26, 21}
- Cycle 25: {21, 26, 25, 3, 21}
- Cycle 26: {21, 9, 19, 15, 21}
- Cycle 27: {21, 22, 6, 22, 21}
- Cycle 28: {17, 12, 2, 3, 17}
- Cycle 29: {17, 1, 24, 8, 17}
- Cycle 30: {17, 5, 28, 19, 17}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (22, 7), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (9, 16), 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (27, 29), 7>
