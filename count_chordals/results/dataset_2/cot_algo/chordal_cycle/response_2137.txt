Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-6-5-1
- Cycle 2: 3-1-6-4-3
- Cycle 3: 3-1-4-8-3
- Cycle 4: 3-1-5-6-3
- Cycle 5: 6-4-9-7-6
- Cycle 6: 6-4-8-7-6
- Cycle 7: 2-3-1-6-2
- Cycle 8: 2-3-5-6-2
- Cycle 9: 2-3-1-4-2
- Cycle 10: 2-3-0-9-2
- Cycle 11: 0-2-3-5-0
- Cycle 12: 0-2-6-8-0
- Cycle 13: 0-3-9-7-0
- Cycle 14: 5-6-1-3-5
- Cycle 15: 5-6-4-8-5
- Cycle 16: 5-6-2-3-5
- Cycle 17: 5-6-4-9-5 

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords
- Cycle 2 has chords {1, 6}
- Cycle 3 has chords {4, 8}
- Cycle 4 has chords {1, 5}
- Cycle 5 has chords {4, 9}
- Cycle 6 has chords {4, 8}
- Cycle 7 has no chords
- Cycle 8 has no chords
- Cycle 9 has chords {1, 4}
- Cycle 10 has chords {0, 9}
- Cycle 11 has no chords
- Cycle 12 has no chords
- Cycle 13 has no chords
- Cycle 14 has chords {1, 3}
- Cycle 15 has chords {4, 8}
- Cycle 16 has chords {3, 2}
- Cycle 17 has chords {4, 9}

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<2, (1, 6)>
<3, (4, 8)>
<4, (1, 5)>
<5, (4, 9)>
<10, (0, 9)>
<14, (1, 3)>
<15, (4, 8)>
<16, (3, 2)>
