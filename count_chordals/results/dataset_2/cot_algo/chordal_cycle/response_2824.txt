Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (11, 14) (11, 18) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 14) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 7) (7, 17) (7, 5) (7, 10) (19, 13) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 4) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 16) (1, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

There are several cycles in the graph, but we will focus on the cycles of length 4 for potential chordal 4-cycles.

1. Cycle 1: 5 - 15 - 2 - 9 - 5
2. Cycle 2: 5 - 17 - 7 - 10 - 5
3. Cycle 3: 5 - 13 - 4 - 6 - 5
4. Cycle 4: 5 - 13 - 8 - 12 - 5
5. Cycle 5: 13 - 8 - 12 - 14 - 13
6. Cycle 6: 13 - 19 - 0 - 9 - 13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

<2, (5, 9)>
<4, (5, 10)>
<5, (13, 12)>
<6, (13, 9)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found.

Putting this number inside brackets: [2].
