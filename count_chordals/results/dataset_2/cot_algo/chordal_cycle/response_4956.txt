Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 19) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 11) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 17) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 12) (6, 2) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 17) (10, 13) (10, 3) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 19) (14, 15) (14, 19) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 11) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
After listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord:
<>
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
