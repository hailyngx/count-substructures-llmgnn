Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 12) (26, 5) (26, 21) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 22) (17, 27) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 13) (20, 17) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 21) (6, 23) (6, 13) (21, 26) (21, 6) (21, 11) (21, 15) (15, 21) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 24) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 24) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 22) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 1) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (12, 9) (12, 16) (12, 4) (5, 26) (5, 29) (5, 27) (22, 17) (22, 8) (22, 24) (24, 15) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 1) (7, 28) (29, 8) (29, 5) (29, 13) (11, 21) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 25) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 4) (27, 17) (27, 5) (1, 19) (1, 4) (1, 24) (1, 25) (1, 0) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 18) (0, 15) (0, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 29) (18, 10) (18, 25) (2, 11) (2, 23) (2, 28) (23, 6) (23, 25) (23, 2) (28, 7) (28, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-12-9-3-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-12-16-15-0-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-3-9-12-16-15-0-1
- Cycle 4: 1-4-3-14-17-20-6-21-26-5-1
- Cycle 5: 1-4-3-14-17-20-6-13-29-5-1
- Cycle 6: 1-19-8-10-13-6-20-17-14-3-4-1
- Cycle 7: 1-19-25-11-21-15-16-12-4-3-1
- Cycle 8: 1-19-25-11-21-6-20-17-14-3-4-1
- Cycle 9: 1-25-23-6-13-10-8-22-17-20-6-21-11-25-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 4, 12, 9, 3> (Chord: (9, 12))
- <1, (4, 12), 16, 15, 0> (Chord: (4, 12))
- <1, 4, (3, 9), 12, 16, 15, 0> (Chord: (3, 9))
- <1, 4, 3, 14, (17, 20), 6, 21, 26, 5> (Chord: (17, 20))
- <1, 4, 3, 14, 17, (20, 6), 13, 29, 5> (Chord: (20, 6))
- <1, 19, 8, 10, 13, 6, 20, 17, (14, 3), 4> (Chord: (14, 3))
- <1, 19, 25, 11, 21, 15, 16, 12, (4, 3), 14> (Chord: (4, 3))
- <1, 19, 25, 11, 21, 6, 20, 17, (14, 3), 4> (Chord: (14, 3))
- <1, 25, 23, 6, 13, 10, 8, 22, 17, (20, 6), 21, 11, 25> (Chord: (20, 6))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [9]
