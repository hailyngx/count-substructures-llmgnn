Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 11) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (2, 14) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1 - 3 - 6 - 13 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 2: 8 - 1 - 4 - 9 - 8
- Cycle 3: 1 - 4 - 13 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 8 - 11 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 8 - 5 - 12 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 7 - 3 - 10 - 1
- Cycle 7: 6 - 3 - 10 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 8: 6 - 11 - 7 - 14 - 6
- Cycle 9: 4 - 13 - 12 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 10: 8 - 5 - 12 - 13 - 8
- Cycle 11: 1 - 10 - 9 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 12: 1 - 10 - 12 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 13: 1 - 4 - 9 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 14: 8 - 12 - 5 - 8
- Cycle 15: 8 - 12 - 13 - 6 - 8
- Cycle 16: 8 - 12 - 0 - 9 - 8
- Cycle 17: 9 - 7 - 11 - 0 - 9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has one chord: <1, 4>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: <1, 4>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: <1, 13>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: <1, 11>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: <1, 5>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: <1, 3>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: <3, 9>
- Cycle 8 has one chord: <7, 14>
- Cycle 9 has one chord: <5, 13> and <4, 12>
- Cycle 10 has one chord: <8, 12>
- Cycle 11 has one chord: <1, 9>
- Cycle 12 has one chord: <1, 12>
- Cycle 13 has one chord: <1, 9>
- Cycle 14 has one chord: <5, 12>
- Cycle 15 has one chord: <6, 12>
- Cycle 16 has one chord: <0, 12>
- Cycle 17 has one chord: <7, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [16].
