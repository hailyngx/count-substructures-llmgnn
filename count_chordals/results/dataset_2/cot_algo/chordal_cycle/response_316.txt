Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 5 - 4 - 7 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 8 - 7 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 3: 9 - 7 - 4 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 4: 9 - 0 - 1 - 5 - 9
- Cycle 5: 6 - 2 - 4 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 6: 6 - 3 - 4 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 7: 6 - 0 - 4 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 8: 4 - 0 - 1 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 9: 8 - 3 - 4 - 7 - 8
- Cycle 10: 8 - 1 - 5 - 9 - 8
- Cycle 11: 3 - 4 - 7 - 8 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- None of the cycles above have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 11 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
