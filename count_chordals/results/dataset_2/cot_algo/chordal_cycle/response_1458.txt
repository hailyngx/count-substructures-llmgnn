Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-4-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-3-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-6-3-2-0
- Cycle 4: 1-3-6-0-1
- Cycle 5: 1-8-9-7-1
- Cycle 6: 1-7-6-0-1
- Cycle 7: 3-4-2-7-3
- Cycle 8: 4-9-2-7-4
- Cycle 9: 8-1-7-2-8
- Cycle 10: 8-4-2-3-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- From Cycle 1, we have one chord: (0, 4)
- From Cycle 2, we have one chord: (1, 3)
- From Cycle 3, we have one chord: (0, 3)
- From Cycle 4, we have one chord: (1, 0)
- From Cycle 5, we have one chord: (1, 9)
- From Cycle 6, we have one chord: (1, 6)
- From Cycle 7, we have one chord: (3, 7)
- From Cycle 8, we have one chord: (4, 7)
- From Cycle 9, we have one chord: (1, 2)
- From Cycle 10, we have one chord: (3, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 4, 3, 5> with chord (0, 4)
- <1, 3, 2, 0> with chord (1, 3)
- <0, 3, 2, 6> with chord (0, 3)
- <1, 0, 6, 3> with chord (1, 0)
- <1, 6, 7, 9> with chord (1, 9)
- <1, 7, 6, 0> with chord (1, 6)
- <3, 7, 2, 4> with chord (3, 7)
- <4, 7, 2, 9> with chord (4, 7)
- <1, 2, 7, 8> with chord (1, 2)
- <3, 2, 4, 8> with chord (3, 2)
