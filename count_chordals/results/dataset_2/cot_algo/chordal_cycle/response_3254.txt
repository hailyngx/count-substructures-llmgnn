Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 3)
- Cycle 2: (5, 10, 14, 0)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 7, 1)
- Cycle 4: (5, 0, 13, 14)
- Cycle 5: (9, 4, 12, 1)
- Cycle 6: (9, 10, 6, 7)
- Cycle 7: (9, 3, 2, 7)
- Cycle 8: (1, 11, 0, 3)
- Cycle 9: (1, 12, 4, 9)
- Cycle 10: (3, 11, 0, 2)
- Cycle 11: (3, 7, 13, 0)
- Cycle 12: (7, 6, 2, 3)
- Cycle 13: (7, 13, 0, 5)
- Cycle 14: (0, 11, 1, 7)
- Cycle 15: (0, 14, 13, 8)
- Cycle 16: (2, 6, 10, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (3, 11), 0>
- <5, (6, 10), 14>
- <7, (13, 0), 5>
- <9, (4, 12), 1>
- <2, (6, 10), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
