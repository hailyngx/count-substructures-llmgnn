Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 12) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 19) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 12) (1, 7) (1, 17) (15, 10) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (12, 17) (12, 2) (3, 7) (3, 13) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 14) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (18, 16) (18, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- <11, 16, 13, 17> 
- <11, 16, 18, 14> 
- <11, 17, 12, 2> 
- <16, 13, 3, 7> 
- <16, 6, 0, 14> 
- <16, 8, 9, 5> 
- <17, 12, 2, 10> 
- <17, 13, 3, 7> 
- <0, 14, 18, 16> 
- <0, 6, 16, 11> 
- <0, 19, 11, 17> 
- <2, 10, 15, 10> 
- <2, 12, 17, 11> 
- <3, 13, 16, 11> 
- <4, 8, 9, 5> 
- <4, 7, 3, 13> 
- <5, 9, 8, 16> 
- <7, 3, 13, 17> 
- <14, 18, 16, 11> 
- <14, 0, 6, 16> 
- <14, 19, 11, 17> 
- <15, 10, 2, 12> 

Step 2: 
Checking cycles for exactly one chord: 
- Found one chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord <11, (16, 13), 17)> 
- Found one chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord <11, (17, 12), 2)> 
- Found one chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord <16, (14, 18), 11)> 
- Found one chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord <16, (6, 0), 14)> 
- Found one chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord <16, (9, 5), 8)> 
- Found one chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord <17, (3, 13), 7)> 
- Found one chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord <0, (6, 16), 11)> 
- Found one chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord <2, (10, 15), 10)> 

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
- [15]
