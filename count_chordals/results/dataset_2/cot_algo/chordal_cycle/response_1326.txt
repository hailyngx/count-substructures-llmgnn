Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:  
- There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.  
- One of the cycles is: 0-1-6-7-0  
- Another cycle is: 2-0-6-1-2  
- Yet another cycle is: 2-5-3-4-2  
- One more cycle is: 4-7-6-0-4  
- And one final cycle is: 3-0-1-6-3  

Step 2:  
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find that the cycle 2-5-3-4-2 has exactly one chord (2, 3).
- So, the chordal 4-cycle found is: <<2, 3, (5, 4)>>  

Step 3:  
- The final number of chordless cycles found is [0].
