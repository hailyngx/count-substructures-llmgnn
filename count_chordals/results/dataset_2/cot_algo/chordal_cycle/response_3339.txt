Step 2: Checking for one chord:
- <0, 11, 2, 20, 5> - Chord: (11, 5)
- <0, 14, 28, 6, 23> - Chord: (14, 6)
- <1, 4, 15, 29, 22> - Chord: (4, 29)
- <2, 11, 8, 25, 7> - Chord: (11, 25)
- <3, 24, 0, 14, 28> - Chord: (24, 14)
- <4, 8, 25, 7, 5> - Chord: (8, 5)
- <5, 20, 2, 0, 11> - Chord: (20, 0)
- <6, 23, 17, 27, 24> - Chord: (23, 27)
- <7, 25, 8, 11, 0> - Chord: (25, 0)
- <8, 11, 0, 14, 22> - Chord: (11, 14)
- <9, 4, 8, 11, 0> - Chord: (4, 11)
- <10, 29, 15, 4, 8> - Chord: (29, 15)
- <12, 17, 23, 6, 28> - Chord: (17, 6)
- <13, 3, 24, 27, 10> - Chord: (3, 27)
- <16, 1, 23, 17, 27> - Chord: (1, 17)
- <18, 11, 8, 4, 15> - Chord: (11, 4)
- <22, 14, 28, 6, 23> - Chord: (14, 6)
- <23, 17, 27, 24, 0> - Chord: (17, 24)
- <27, 10, 29, 15, 4> - Chord: (10, 15)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 18 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [18].
