Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-2-3-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-6-7-2-1-3-0
- Cycle 4: 0-4-9-8-3-1-2-0
- Cycle 5: 0-5-2-7-6-3-9-0
- Cycle 6: 1-3-6-7-2-9-4-1
- Cycle 7: 2-5-4-6-3-8-9-2

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes) is:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (4, 9), 3, 1, 0>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we find [1].
