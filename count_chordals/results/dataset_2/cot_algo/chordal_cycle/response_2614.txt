Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
1. 1-9-5-6-1
2. 2-9-5-6-2
3. 3-9-5-8-3
4. 4-9-5-8-4
5. 7-9-5-8-7
6. 2-9-4-3-2
7. 6-9-4-3-6
8. 1-9-4-6-1
9. 1-9-4-2-1
10. 1-9-7-3-1
11. 2-9-7-3-2
12. 8-9-7-3-8
13. 0-6-5-8-0
14. 1-6-5-8-1
15. 2-6-5-8-2
16. 3-6-5-8-3
17. 2-6-4-9-2
18. 2-6-4-3-2
19. 1-6-4-9-1
20. 1-6-4-3-1
21. 1-6-2-9-1
22. 1-6-2-4-1
23. 1-6-7-9-1
24. 2-6-7-9-2
25. 2-6-7-3-2
26. 8-7-9-5-8
27. 3-7-9-5-3
28. 1-7-9-5-1

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
<1, (2, 9), 6>
<1, (4, 9), 6>
<1, (6, 9), 4>
<1, (3, 7), 9>
<1, (5, 8), 9> 

Step 3:
After counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [23].
