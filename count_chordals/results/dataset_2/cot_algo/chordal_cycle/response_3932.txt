Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-7-5
- Cycle 2: 5-7-1-3-5
- Cycle 3: 5-6-4-9-5
- Cycle 4: 5-0-2-1-5
- Cycle 5: 9-4-6-7-9
- Cycle 6: 9-2-1-3-9
- Cycle 7: 7-1-2-3-7
- Cycle 8: 4-7-6-5-4
- Cycle 9: 4-9-2-1-4
- Cycle 10: 7-5-0-2-7

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <1, (4, 7), 5> - Chord: (4, 7)
2. <2, (1, 3), 5> - Chord: (1, 3)
3. <3, (4, 9), 5> - Chord: (4, 9)
4. <4, (2, 0), 5> - Chord: (2, 0)
5. <5, (6, 4), 9> - Chord: (6, 4)
6. <6, (1, 3), 9> - Chord: (1, 3)
7. <7, (2, 3), 1> - Chord: (2, 3)
8. <8, (5, 7), 4> - Chord: (5, 7)
9. <9, (2, 1), 4> - Chord: (2, 1)
10. <10, (0, 2), 7> - Chord: (0, 2)

Step 3:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the final count is [10].
