Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 17) (7, 8) (18, 22) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 24) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 23) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 1) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 13) (20, 6) (26, 22) (26, 8) (1, 27) (1, 20) (1, 17) (17, 7) (17, 20) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 28) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 2) (25, 27) (25, 8) (16, 0) (28, 3) (28, 13) (28, 10) (9, 27) (9, 15) (9, 21) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 2) (5, 21) (5, 14) (29, 7) (29, 24) (29, 21) (23, 12) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 21) (21, 18) (21, 9) (21, 5) (21, 29) (21, 13) (8, 7) (8, 26) (8, 25) (8, 6) (14, 5) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 9) (19, 17) (19, 10) (6, 0) (6, 20) (6, 8) (10, 28) (10, 19) (24, 22) (24, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 12, 18, 22, 4)
- Cycle 2: (7, 17, 20, 1, 7)
- Cycle 3: (7, 17, 1, 27, 9, 15, 18, 12, 4, 7)
- Cycle 4: (7, 17, 1, 20, 6, 0, 15, 18, 12, 4, 7)
- Cycle 5: (11, 2, 4, 12, 18, 21, 5, 2, 11)
- Cycle 6: (11, 3, 17, 7, 4, 12, 18, 15, 9, 27, 1, 20, 17, 3, 11)
- Cycle 7: (27, 9, 15, 18, 12, 4, 2, 5, 21, 29, 24, 22, 18, 21, 13, 20, 1, 27)
- Cycle 8: (0, 20, 1, 27, 9, 21, 18, 12, 4, 11, 2, 5, 21, 29, 24, 22, 18, 15, 0)
- Cycle 9: (17, 1, 27, 9, 15, 18, 21, 13, 28, 10, 19, 17)
- Cycle 10: (3, 11, 2, 5, 21, 29, 24, 26, 22, 18, 15, 0, 6, 20, 1, 17, 3)
- Cycle 11: (28, 13, 20, 1, 27, 9, 15, 18, 12, 4, 7, 8, 26, 22, 24, 29, 21, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 12), 4, 22, (18, 22), 18, 12> has one chord: (4, 18) 
- <2, (7, 17), 1, 7> has one chord: (2, 7)
- <3, (7, 17), 1, 27, 9, 15, 18, 12, 4, 7> has one chord: (1, 4)
- <4, (7, 17), 1, 20, 6, 0, 15, 18, 12, 4, 7> has one chord: (1, 4)
- <5, 11, 2, (4, 12), 18, 21, 5> has one chord: (2, 18)
- <6, (11, 3), 17, 7, 4, 12, 18, 15, 9, 27, 1, 20, 17, 3> has one chord: (3, 4)
- <7, 27, 9, 15, 18, 12, 4, 2, 5, (21, 29), 24, 22, 18, 21, 13, 20, 1> has one chord: (5, 21)
- <8, (0, 20), 1, 27, 9, 21, 18, 12, 4, 11, 2, 5, (21, 29), 24, 22, 18, 15, 0> has one chord: (2, 18)
- <9, 17, 1, 27, 9, 15, 18, 21, 13, (28, 10), 19> has one chord: (13, 19)
- <10, (3, 11), 2, 5, 21, (29, 24), 26, 22, 18, 15, 0, 6, 20, 1, 17, 3> has one chord: (2, 29)
- <11, 28, 13, 20, 1, 27, 9, 15, 18, 12, 4, 7, 8, (26, 22), 24, 29, 21, 13> has one chord: (24, 26)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Thus, the final count is [11].
