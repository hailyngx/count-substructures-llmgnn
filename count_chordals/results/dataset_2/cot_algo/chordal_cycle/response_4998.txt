Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 2) (6, 14) (12, 5) (12, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<10, 4, 8, 5>
<11, 3, 7, 1>
<13, 2, 4, 8>
<13, 2, 14, 6>
<4, 9, 7, 3>
<4, 9, 11, 1>
<8, 5, 12, 1>
<1, 7, 9, 0>
<1, 5, 12, 1>
<2, 13, 7, 1>
<14, 6, 2, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

The cycle <10, 4, 8, 5> has one chord: (4, 8)
The cycle <11, 3, 7, 1> has one chord: (3, 1)
The cycle <13, 2, 4, 8> has one chord: (2, 8)
The cycle <13, 2, 14, 6> has one chord: (2, 14)
The cycle <4, 9, 7, 3> has one chord: (4, 7)
The cycle <4, 9, 11, 1> has one chord: (4, 1)
The cycle <8, 5, 12, 1> has one chord: (5, 12)
The cycle <1, 7, 9, 0> has one chord: (7, 9)
The cycle <1, 5, 12, 1> has one chord: (5, 12)
The cycle <2, 13, 7, 1> has one chord: (13, 7)
The cycle <14, 6, 2, 13> has one chord: (6, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 0 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
