Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (5, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 1) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (6, 4, 7, 6)
- Cycle 2: (9, 8, 4, 9)
- Cycle 3: (4, 3, 14, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 11, 6, 7)
- Cycle 5: (8, 2, 12, 8)
- Cycle 6: (2, 0, 12, 2)
- Cycle 7: (12, 11, 0, 12)
- Cycle 8: (11, 0, 12, 11)
- Cycle 9: (3, 10, 1, 3)
- Cycle 10: (14, 1, 13, 14)
- Cycle 11: (13, 6, 7, 13)
- Cycle 12: (10, 9, 12, 10)
- Cycle 13: (1, 8, 14, 1)
- Cycle 14: (0, 2, 8, 0)
- Cycle 15: (5, 0, 2, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (13, 14), 10>
- <2, (12, 0), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of the chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
