Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - <5, 23, 18, 4, 2>
        - <5, 23, 18, 4, 2, 6>
        - <5, 12, 25, 7, 19>
        - <5, 27, 17, 8, 28>
        - <9, 6, 2, 16, 15>
        - <2, 4, 18, 23, 28>
        - <6, 2, 4, 18, 23>
        - <6, 2, 16, 15, 10>
        - <1, 21, 22, 5, 12>
        - <18, 4, 2, 6, 3>
        - <18, 4, 2, 16, 15>
        - <18, 20, 7, 19, 3>
        - <18, 24, 25, 12, 5>
        - <7, 25, 12, 5, 21>
        - <7, 25, 24, 18, 4>
        - <7, 19, 3, 26, 10>
        - <25, 12, 5, 21, 1>
        - <25, 24, 18, 4, 2>
        - <10, 15, 16, 2, 4>
        - <15, 16, 2, 6, 9>
        - <17, 8, 11, 29>
        - <17, 8, 28, 23, 18>
        - <12, 5, 27, 14, 28>
        - <26, 3, 19, 7, 25>
        - <8, 28, 23, 18, 4>
        - <3, 6, 2, 16, 15>
        - <3, 13, 10, 15, 16>
        - <14, 10, 15, 16, 2>
        - <27, 5, 21, 22, 1>
        - <28, 23, 18, 4, 2>
        - <0, 11, 29, 8, 17>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <5, 23, 18, (4, 2), 6>
        - <18, 20, (7, 19), 3, 26>
        - <7, 25, 12, (5, 21), 1>
        - <10, 15, 16, 2, (4, 18)>
        - <17, 8, 11, (28, 23), 18>
        - <12, 5, 27, (14, 28), 28>
        - <26, 3, 19, 7, (25, 12)>
        - <8, 28, 23, (18, 4), 4>
        - <27, 5, 21, 22, (1, 18)>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are [9] chordal 4-cycles found.
