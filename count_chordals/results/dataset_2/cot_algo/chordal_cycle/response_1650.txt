Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-3-8-0
- Cycle 2: 1-5-8-6-1
- Cycle 3: 2-7-5-8-2
- Cycle 4: 3-9-4-8-3
- Cycle 5: 5-8-4-0-5
- Cycle 6: 6-8-5-1-6
- Cycle 7: 7-2-9-4-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 4-8
- Cycle 2 has a chord 5-8
- Cycle 3 has a chord 5-8
- Cycle 4 has a chord 4-9
- Cycle 5 has a chord 0-8
- Cycle 6 has a chord 5-6
- Cycle 7 has a chord 2-9

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, (4, 8), 5>
<1, (5, 8), 6>
<2, (5, 8), 3>
<3, (4, 9), 4>
<5, (0, 8), 8>
<6, (5, 6), 1>
<7, (2, 9), 4>
