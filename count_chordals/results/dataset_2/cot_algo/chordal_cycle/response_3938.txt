Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 16) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 19) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 1) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 12) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 1) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 18) (13, 6) (9, 13) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 6) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 13) (6, 12) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 17) (4, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: (1, 2, 5, 7)

6. Cycle 6: (1, 12, 6, 8)
7. Cycle 7: (1, 19, 17, 18)
8. Cycle 8: (2, 1, 19, 17)
9. Cycle 9: (2, 5, 7, 11)
10. Cycle 10: (2, 5, 3, 8)
11. Cycle 11: (2, 5, 7, 15)
12. Cycle 12: (2, 17, 19, 11)
13. Cycle 13: (3, 5, 7, 15)
14. Cycle 14: (3, 8, 6, 13)
15. Cycle 15: (4, 16, 15, 12)
16. Cycle 16: (4, 16, 18, 17)
17. Cycle 17: (5, 2, 17, 18)
18. Cycle 18: (5, 7, 15, 12)
19. Cycle 19: (6, 8, 10, 14)
20. Cycle 20: (6, 8, 3, 5)
21. Cycle 21: (6, 12, 1, 10)
22. Cycle 22: (6, 13, 14, 10)
23. Cycle 23: (6, 15, 7, 11)
24. Cycle 24: (6, 15, 12, 1)
25. Cycle 25: (7, 11, 19, 10)
26. Cycle 26: (7, 15, 6, 8)
27. Cycle 27: (10, 14, 13, 18)
28. Cycle 28: (10, 19, 17, 18)
29. Cycle 29: (11, 7, 5, 3)
30. Cycle 30: (13, 14, 10, 1)
31. Cycle 31: (13, 18, 17, 2)
32. Cycle 32: (15, 7, 5, 3)
33. Cycle 33: (16, 0, 15, 12)
34. Cycle 34: (16, 0, 18, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- There are no chords in any of the cycles listed above.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 34 chordless cycles found in the graph, so the final number of chordal 4-cycles is [34].
