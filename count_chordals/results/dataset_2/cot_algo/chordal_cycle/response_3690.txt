Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 8, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 4, 3, 6, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 4, 8, 2, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 3, 2, 7, 9)
- Cycle 6: (4, 8, 2, 3, 4)
- Cycle 7: (8, 2, 7, 3, 8)
- Cycle 8: (6, 3, 2, 0, 6)
- Cycle 9: (2, 7, 0, 1, 2)
- Cycle 10: (7, 0, 1, 2, 7)

Step 2:

- For Cycle 4: (9, 4, 8, 2, 9) -> Chord (4, 2)
- For Cycle 5: (9, 3, 2, 7, 9) -> Chord (3, 7)

Step 3: 

There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the answer is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <4, (4, 2), 8>
2. <5, (3, 7), 9>
