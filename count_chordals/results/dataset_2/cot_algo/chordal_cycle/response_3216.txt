Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 27) (15, 1) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 2) (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 8) (1, 15) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 13) (21, 27) (21, 0) (21, 29) (26, 1) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 17) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 26) (17, 29) (17, 25) (29, 21) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 11) (10, 4) (10, 23) (10, 5) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 9) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 16) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 22) (4, 2) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 11) (22, 24) (25, 17) (25, 6) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 20) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 8) (24, 9) (24, 13) (2, 27) (2, 4) (2, 13) (20, 26) (20, 16) (20, 18) (8, 0) (8, 24) (9, 19) (9, 24) (9, 7) (12, 14) (12, 18) (13, 1) (13, 24) (13, 2) (11, 26) (11, 29) (11, 22) (28, 7) (7, 9) (7, 28) (18, 20) (18, 12) (23, 29) (23, 10) 

Response:
There are 13 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, represented as follows:
1. <3, 15, (15, 27), 27>
2. <3, 17, (17, 26), 26>
3. <3, 22, (22, 4), 4>
4. <15, 27, (27, 0), 0>
5. <15, 1, (1, 26), 26>
6. <27, 0, (0, 21), 21>
7. <27, 21, (21, 29), 29>
8. <0, 21, (21, 29), 29>
9. <1, 26, (26, 17), 17>
10. <21, 29, (29, 17), 17>
11. <26, 17, (17, 25), 25>
12. <10, 23, (23, 29), 29>
13. <5, 19, (19, 9), 9>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found in the graph is [13].
