Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
- (4, 7, 1, 8, 4)
- (4, 7, 6, 5, 4)
- (4, 7, 2, 8, 4)
- (4, 6, 1, 7, 4)
- (4, 6, 2, 7, 4)
- (4, 2, 7, 1, 4)
- (4, 2, 8, 1, 4)
- (7, 6, 1, 8, 7)
- (7, 6, 5, 4, 7)
- (7, 1, 8, 2, 7)
- (7, 1, 0, 9, 7)
- (6, 1, 7, 4, 6)
- (6, 1, 8, 2, 6)
- (6, 5, 4, 7, 6)
- (6, 5, 4, 2, 6)
- (2, 7, 1, 8, 2)
- (2, 7, 4, 5, 2)
- (2, 8, 1, 7, 2)
- (2, 8, 4, 5, 2)
- (1, 7, 4, 5, 1)
- (1, 7, 6, 2, 1)
- (1, 8, 4, 2, 1)
- (1, 8, 3, 8, 1)
- (5, 4, 6, 7, 5)
- (5, 4, 6, 1, 5)
- (3, 8, 1, 7, 3)
- (3, 8, 2, 6, 3)
- (8, 1, 7, 0, 8)
- (8, 1, 4, 5, 8)
- (8, 3, 8, 1, 8)
- (8, 3, 8, 0, 8)
- (8, 4, 5, 6, 8)
- (8, 4, 7, 1, 8)
- (8, 2, 6, 1, 8)
- (5, 6, 7, 1, 5)
- (5, 6, 2, 4, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (2, 8), 4, 7>
- <1, (4, 5), 6, 7>
- <1, (8, 1), 7, 4>
- <5, (4, 6), 7, 5>
- <1, (6, 2), 7, 4>
- <2, (7, 1), 8, 2>
- <3, (8, 0), 1, 7>
- <3, (8, 1), 7, 3>
- <2, (4, 5), 8, 2>
- <5, (4, 6), 7, 5>
- <5, (6, 5), 4, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so [11].
