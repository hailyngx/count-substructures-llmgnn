Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 16) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 16) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 14) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 15) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 14) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (9, 0) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 14) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 11) (13, 4) (13, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 2, 5, 10)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 16, 17, 1)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 0, 6, 14)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 19, 14, 1)
- Cycle 5: (4, 16, 17, 1, 15)
- Cycle 6: (5, 2, 15, 16, 4)
- Cycle 7: (5, 10, 17, 16, 4)
- Cycle 8: (5, 12, 11, 0, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 0, 6, 14, 19)
- Cycle 10: (8, 3, 15, 16, 4)
- Cycle 11: (14, 6, 0, 11, 5)
- Cycle 12: (14, 1, 17, 16, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 10)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (3, 1)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (7, 14)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (4, 14)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (15, 1)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (5, 4)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (10, 4)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (12, 7)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (0, 19)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (8, 4)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (6, 5)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (1, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, (3, 1), 17>
