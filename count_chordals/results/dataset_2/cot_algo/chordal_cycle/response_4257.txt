Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 20) (7, 21) (7, 23) (7, 26) (7, 13) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 11) (21, 18) (3, 28) (3, 17) (25, 9) (25, 22) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 20) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 4) (28, 21) (28, 3) (22, 9) (22, 25) (22, 5) (22, 29) (5, 22) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 29) (27, 16) (1, 10) (1, 23) (1, 0) (15, 29) (15, 24) (15, 2) (26, 7) (26, 20) (26, 16) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 23) (12, 14) (12, 19) (12, 20) (16, 27) (16, 26) (16, 2) (18, 9) (18, 21) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 1) (29, 22) (29, 4) (29, 15) (20, 9) (20, 14) (20, 26) (20, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 21) (23, 7) (23, 1) (23, 19) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 10) (24, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (4, 6, 9, 22, 25, 19, 12, 14, 17, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (7, 13, 5, 22, 9, 6, 0, 1, 10, 8, 14, 17, 4, 10, 13, 7)
        - Cycle 3: (16, 2, 15, 29, 22, 9, 6, 0, 1, 10, 2, 16)
        - Cycle 4: (26, 20, 9, 6, 0, 1, 23, 19, 12, 20)
        - Cycle 5: (28, 3, 17, 14, 8, 10, 2, 15, 24, 29, 15)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has 3 chords: (22, 19), (14, 25), (12, 4)
        - Cycle 2 has 3 chords: (22, 6), (0, 13), (17, 10)
        - Cycle 3 has 0 chords
        - Cycle 4 has 0 chords
        - Cycle 5 has 0 chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final count is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <4, (22, 19), 25, 12): Chord (22, 19)>
        <7, 13, 5, 22, 9, 6, 0, 1, 10, 8, 14, 17, 4, 10, 13, 7): Chord (22, 6)>
