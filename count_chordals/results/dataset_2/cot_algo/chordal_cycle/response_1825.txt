Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0)

- Cycle 5: (6, 9, 2, 6) (Chord: (9, 2))
- Cycle 6: (6, 9, 5, 6) (Chord: (9, 5))
- Cycle 7: (1, 9, 5, 1) (Chord: (9, 5))
- Cycle 8: (1, 9, 6, 1) (Chord: (9, 6))
- Cycle 9: (1, 9, 2, 1) (Chord: (9, 2))
- Cycle 10: (3, 6, 9, 3) (Chord: (6, 9))
- Cycle 11: (3, 6, 2, 3) (Chord: (6, 2))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord, we get a total of [39]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<5, (9, 6), 6>
