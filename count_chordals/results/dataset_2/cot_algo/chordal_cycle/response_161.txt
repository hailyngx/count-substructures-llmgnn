Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (1, 7, 4, 5, 1)
- (1, 7, 4, 2, 3, 1)
- (1, 7, 6, 3, 1)
- (1, 7, 6, 5, 1)
- (1, 5, 4, 2, 3, 1)
- (1, 5, 6, 3, 1)
- (1, 5, 6, 7, 1)
- (1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1)
- (1, 3, 6, 7, 1)
- (1, 3, 6, 5, 1)
- (1, 3, 8, 5, 1)
- (1, 9, 7, 6, 1)
- (1, 9, 0, 5, 1)
- (1, 8, 3, 2, 1)
- (1, 8, 5, 6, 1)
- (1, 8, 2, 4, 5, 1)
- (1, 8, 2, 3, 1)
- (1, 8, 2, 3, 6, 1)
- (7, 4, 2, 3, 6, 7)
- (7, 4, 5, 6, 7)
- (7, 6, 3, 2, 4, 7)
- (7, 6, 5, 4, 7)
- (7, 9, 0, 5, 6, 7)
- (5, 4, 2, 3, 6, 5)
- (5, 4, 7, 6, 5)
- (5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 5)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (7, 4), 5>
- <1, (7, 6), 3>
- <1, (7, 6), 5>
- <1, (5, 4), 2>
- <1, (5, 6), 3>
- <1, (5, 6), 7>
- <1, (3, 2), 4>
- <1, (3, 6), 7>
- <1, (3, 6), 5>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found = [9]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <1, (7, 4), 5>
- <1, (7, 6), 3>
- <1, (7, 6), 5>
- <1, (5, 4), 2>
- <1, (5, 6), 3>
- <1, (5, 6), 7>
- <1, (3, 2), 4>
- <1, (3, 6), 7>
- <1, (3, 6), 5>
