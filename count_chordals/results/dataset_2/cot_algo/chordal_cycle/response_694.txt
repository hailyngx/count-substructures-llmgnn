Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 11) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (8, 13, 5, 2, 8)
        - Cycle 2: (8, 12, 6, 7, 8)
        - Cycle 3: (13, 5, 11, 6, 13)
        - Cycle 4: (13, 3, 7, 6, 13)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 11, 2, 0, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (6, 7, 13, 8, 6)
        - Cycle 7: (0, 4, 5, 2, 0)
        - Cycle 8: (5, 2, 1, 14, 5)
        - Cycle 9: (7, 6, 12, 10, 7)
        - Cycle 10: (12, 11, 6, 7, 12)
        - Cycle 11: (9, 7, 13, 3, 9)
        - Cycle 12: (10, 0, 4, 14, 10)
        - Cycle 13: (11, 2, 1, 10, 11)
        - Cycle 14: (3, 7, 6, 11, 3)
        - Cycle 15: (1, 8, 6, 12, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
        - Unique chordal 4-cycle: <8, (13, 5), 2, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        Only one unique chordal 4-cycle found, therefore the final count is [1].
