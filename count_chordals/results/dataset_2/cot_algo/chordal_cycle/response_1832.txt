Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 9) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 12) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 12) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 19) (10, 12) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle <4, 5, 17, 7>
        - Cycle <4, 16, 7, 17>
        - Cycle <4, 9, 1, 13>
        - Cycle <4, 9, 3, 7>
        - Cycle <4, 9, 8, 9>
        - Cycle <4, 18, 6, 17>
        - Cycle <4, 18, 6, 2>
        - Cycle <4, 18, 12, 11>
        - Cycle <5, 11, 12, 18>
        - Cycle <5, 17, 6, 18>
        - Cycle <7, 3, 9, 1>
        - Cycle <7, 16, 4, 18>
        - Cycle <7, 17, 13, 1>
        - Cycle <9, 1, 13, 17>
        - Cycle <9, 3, 2, 14>
        - Cycle <13, 1, 15, 1>
        - Cycle <13, 17, 5, 11>
        - Cycle <17, 5, 11, 12>
        - Cycle <17, 6, 18, 12>
        - Cycle <17, 7, 3, 9>
        - Cycle <18, 4, 5, 17>
        - Cycle <18, 6, 17, 7>
        - Cycle <18, 12, 11, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle <4, 9, 1, 13> has one chord: (9, 1)
        - Cycle <4, 9, 3, 7> has one chord: (9, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [2]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <4, 9, 1, 13>
        <4, 9, 3, 7>
