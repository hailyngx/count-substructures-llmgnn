Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 0, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 2, 7, 1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 1, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 2, 4, 1, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 1, 4, 2, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 9, 2, 4, 8, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 9, 1, 4, 8, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 2, 4, 8, 3, 5)
- Cycle 9: (9, 1, 7, 2, 4, 8, 3, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 0, 4, 8, 3, 9)
- Cycle 11: (6, 0, 4, 8, 3, 6)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Cycle 1: Chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 2: Chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 3: Chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 4: Chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 5: Chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 6: Chord (9, 8)
- Cycle 7: Chord (9, 8)
- Cycle 8: Chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 9: Chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 10: Chord (0, 9)
- Cycle 11: Chord (6, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
