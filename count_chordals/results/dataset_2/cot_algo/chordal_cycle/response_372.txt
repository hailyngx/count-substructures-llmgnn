Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 18) (4, 19) (18, 3) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 10) (6, 16) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 17) (15, 19) (15, 8) (14, 5) (14, 8) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 12) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 7-1-3-2-7
- Cycle 2: 7-2-3-1-7
- Cycle 3: 8-9-10-7-8
- Cycle 4: 8-9-10-19-8
- Cycle 5: 12-13-5-14-12
- Cycle 6: 17-16-6-0-17

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (7, 2)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (7, 1)
- Cycle 3 has no chords
- Cycle 4 has no chords
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord (5, 14)
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord (16, 0)

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <7, 1, 3, 2> 
- <8, 9, 10, 7>
