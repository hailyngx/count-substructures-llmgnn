Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 16) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 18) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 13) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (0, 2) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 19) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 14) (15, 5) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 18) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 12) (16, 6) (16, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycle (10, 17, 11, 5) exists.
- The cycle (10, 17, 13, 18) exists.

Step 2: 
- The cycle (10, 17, 11, 5) has a chord (10, 5).
- The cycle (10, 17, 13, 18) has a chord (10, 13).

Step 3:
Since both cycles had exactly one chord each, there is [2] unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph. 

The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <10, 17, 11, 5>
- <10, 17, 13, 18>
