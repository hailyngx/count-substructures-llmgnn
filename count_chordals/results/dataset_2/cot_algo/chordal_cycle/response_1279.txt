Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or greater in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-6-5-4
- Cycle 2: 4-7-6-3-4
- Cycle 3: 4-7-8-5-4
- Cycle 4: 4-7-8-3-4
- Cycle 5: 7-6-5-4-7
- Cycle 6: 7-6-3-4-7
- Cycle 7: 7-8-5-4-7
- Cycle 8: 7-8-3-4-7
- Cycle 9: 6-5-4-7-6
- Cycle 10: 6-3-4-7-6
- Cycle 11: 6-5-8-7-6
- Cycle 12: 6-3-8-7-6
- Cycle 13: 5-4-7-6-5
- Cycle 14: 5-2-0-3-5
- Cycle 15: 2-0-6-9-2
- Cycle 16: 8-7-6-5-8
- Cycle 17: 8-7-6-3-8
- Cycle 18: 8-5-4-7-8
- Cycle 19: 8-5-6-7-8
- Cycle 20: 8-3-4-7-8
- Cycle 21: 8-3-6-7-8
- Cycle 22: 3-4-7-8-3
- Cycle 23: 3-0-6-7-3
- Cycle 24: 0-9-6-7-0
- Cycle 25: 1-4-7-8-1
- Cycle 26: 1-4-5-6-1
- Cycle 27: 1-4-5-2-1
- Cycle 28: 1-9-6-3-1

Step 2:
After examining the cycles, we find that cycle <4,7,6,5> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (4,5).

Step 3:
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
