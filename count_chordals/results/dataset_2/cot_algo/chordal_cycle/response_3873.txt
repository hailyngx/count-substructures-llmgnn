Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 4, 11, 12>
- Cycle 3: <5, 11, 2, 12, 4>
- Cycle 4: <5, 11, 14, 7, 8>
- Cycle 5: <5, 7, 12, 13, 8>
- Cycle 6: <9, 6, 1, 4, 12>
- Cycle 7: <9, 6, 3, 8, 7>
- Cycle 8: <9, 4, 12, 13, 8>
- Cycle 9: <4, 12, 13, 10, 9>
- Cycle 10: <7, 12, 13, 3, 8>
- Cycle 11: <6, 1, 0, 14, 7>
- Cycle 12: <6, 1, 10, 13, 8>
- Cycle 13: <8, 13, 3, 0, 1>
- Cycle 14: <12, 2, 11, 14, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Out of the above cycles, the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 6, 1, 4> --> Chord: (9, 4)
- <5, 11, 2, 12, 4> --> Chord: (11, 4)
- <6, 1, 10, 13, 8> --> Chord: (1, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
