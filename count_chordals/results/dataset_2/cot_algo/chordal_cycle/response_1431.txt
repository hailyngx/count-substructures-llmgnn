Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 27) (7, 20) (7, 24) (21, 3) (21, 11) (20, 7) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 8) (25, 0) (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 10) (15, 23) (15, 17) (15, 28) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 17) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 10) (3, 29) (28, 15) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 24) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 0) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 10) (9, 13) (9, 18) (9, 27) (11, 21) (11, 29) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 12) (16, 1) (16, 23) (16, 29) (5, 25) (5, 8) (8, 20) (8, 25) (8, 5) (26, 27) (26, 17) (14, 4) (14, 1) (0, 25) (0, 2) (0, 23) (23, 15) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 6) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 28) (17, 26) (17, 19) (27, 22) (27, 9) (27, 26) (19, 17) (19, 6) (1, 16) (1, 14) (29, 3) (29, 11) (29, 16) (10, 18) (10, 3) (10, 12) (6, 20) (6, 4) (6, 23) (6, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (0, 25, 8, 20, 7, 24, 12, 2, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 23, 6, 4, 17, 28, 3, 21, 11, 29, 16, 1, 14, 4)
- Cycle 3: (2, 13, 22, 18, 10, 3, 21, 11, 29, 16, 23, 0, 2)
- Cycle 4: (4, 14, 1, 16, 29, 11, 21, 3, 28, 15, 23, 6, 4)
- Cycle 5: (6, 19, 17, 15, 23, 0, 25, 8, 5, 25, 20, 6)
- Cycle 6: (7, 20, 25, 0, 23, 6, 19, 17, 26, 27, 22, 13, 2, 12, 24, 7)
- Cycle 7: (8, 20, 25, 5, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- No chord found in Cycle 1
- No chord found in Cycle 2
- Chord found in Cycle 3: <3, (27, 10), 21>
- No chord found in Cycle 4
- No chord found in Cycle 5
- Chord found in Cycle 6: <13, (24, 20), 7>
- No chord found in Cycle 7

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
