Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 4) (10, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Listing all cycles of length 4 or more where every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 1, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 13, 5, 1, 6)
- Cycle 3: (9, 7, 0, 1, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 12, 3, 2, 9)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 8, 9, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 12, 3, 11, 1)
- Cycle 7: (3, 12, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle 8: (8, 4, 10, 2, 8)
- Cycle 9: (5, 13, 14, 8, 5)
- Cycle 10: (0, 1, 5, 13, 0)
- Cycle 11: (7, 13, 14, 8, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 0, 1, 9, 7)
- Cycle 13: (11, 5, 13, 14, 11)
- Cycle 14: (12, 3, 11, 5, 12)
- Cycle 15: (10, 4, 1, 5, 10)
- Cycle 16: (14, 8, 4, 10, 14)
- Cycle 17: (2, 9, 6, 7, 2)

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 is chordal: <1, (9, 4), 6>
- Cycle 2 is chordal: <5, (1, 13), 6>
- Cycle 4 is chordal: <9, (12, 3), 7>
- Cycle 5 is chordal: <4, (1, 8), 9>
- Cycle 6 is chordal: <12, (3, 1), 9>
- Cycle 7 is chordal: <6, (12, 7), 3>
- Cycle 8 is chordal: <10, (4, 8), 2>
- Cycle 9 is chordal: <13, (5, 8), 14>
- Cycle 10 is chordal: <0, (5, 13), 1>
- Cycle 11 is chordal: <7, (8, 14), 13>
- Cycle 13 is chordal: <11, (5, 13), 12>
- Cycle 14 is chordal: <5, (11, 13), 3>
- Cycle 15 is chordal: <1, (4, 5), 10>
- Cycle 16 is chordal: <8, (10, 4), 14>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
- There are 16 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [16].
