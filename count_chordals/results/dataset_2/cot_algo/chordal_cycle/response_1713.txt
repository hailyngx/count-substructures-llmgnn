Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 2, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 8, 1)
- Cycle 5: (9, 7, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (4, 7, 0, 4)
- Cycle 7: (7, 6, 2, 7)
- Cycle 8: (6, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 9: (7, 0, 3, 7)
- Cycle 10: (0, 6, 2, 0)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 3, 5) <(3, 8)>
- Cycle 2: (5, 6, 7, 5) <(7, 2)>
- Cycle 3: (5, 2, 4, 5) <(4, 7)>
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 8, 1) <(8, 9)>
- Cycle 5: (9, 7, 4, 9) <(4, 0)>
- Cycle 10: (0, 6, 2, 0) <(6, 7)>

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final count is [6].
