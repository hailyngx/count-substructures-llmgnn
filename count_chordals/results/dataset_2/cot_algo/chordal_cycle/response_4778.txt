Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 9) (10, 20) (11, 27) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 2) (1, 2) (1, 23) (1, 13) (1, 4) (26, 29) (26, 12) (28, 5) (28, 2) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 18) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 4) (21, 6) (21, 8) (8, 21) (8, 9) (8, 7) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 15) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 24) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 23) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 20) (24, 15) (24, 0) (19, 15) (22, 20) (18, 13) (18, 27) (18, 0) (29, 26) (29, 6) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 3) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 28) (20, 10) (20, 16) (20, 22) (27, 11) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 23) (0, 24) (0, 18) (0, 29) (14, 27) (14, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 23) (4, 25) (23, 1) (23, 7) (23, 27) (23, 4) (12, 17) (12, 26) (12, 14) (12, 25) (12, 3) (25, 16) (25, 4) (25, 12) (3, 29) (3, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (1, 13, 5, 28)
        - Cycle 2: (1, 13, 16, 7)
        - Cycle 3: (1, 13, 16, 25)
        - Cycle 4: (1, 13, 18, 27)
        - Cycle 5: (1, 13, 18, 0)
        - Cycle 6: (1, 13, 18, 27, 23)
        - Cycle 7: (1, 13, 5, 7)
        - Cycle 8: (1, 13, 5, 7, 28)
        - Cycle 9: (1, 13, 5, 7, 16)
        - Cycle 10: (1, 13, 18, 0, 29)
        - Cycle 11: (1, 13, 18, 27, 23, 4)
        - Cycle 12: (1, 13, 5, 7, 23)
        - Cycle 13: (1, 13, 5, 7, 23, 27)
        - Cycle 14: (1, 13, 18, 0, 29, 3)
        - Cycle 15: (1, 13, 5, 7, 23, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - Cycle 6: <1, 13, 18, 27>
        - Cycle 10: <1, 13, 18, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

        There are [2] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
