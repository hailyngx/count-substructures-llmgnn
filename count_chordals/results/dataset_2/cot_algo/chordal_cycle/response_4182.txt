Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle <5, 9, 6, 7> (length 4)
- Cycle <5, 9, 0, 8> (length 4)
- Cycle <5, 4, 7, 3> (length 4)
- Cycle <5, 4, 8, 2> (length 4)
- Cycle <9, 6, 7, 4> (length 4)
- Cycle <9, 6, 5, 1> (length 4)
- Cycle <9, 0, 8, 7> (length 4)
- Cycle <6, 7, 4, 8> (length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <5, 9, 6, 7>: Chord (9, 6)
- <5, 9, 0, 8>: Chord (9, 8)
- <5, 4, 7, 3>: No chord
- <5, 4, 8, 2>: No chord
- <9, 6, 7, 4>: Chord (6, 4)
- <9, 6, 5, 1>: No chord
- <9, 0, 8, 7>: Chord (0, 7)
- <6, 7, 4, 8>: Chord (7, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- There are 2 chordless cycles: <5, 4, 7, 3> and <5, 4, 8, 2>

Final count: [2]
