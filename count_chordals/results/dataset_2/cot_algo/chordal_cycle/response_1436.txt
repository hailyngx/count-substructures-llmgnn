Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 10) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 16) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 4) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 16) (2, 1) (2, 19) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 7) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 18) (7, 0) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 12) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 12) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

Cycles:
- Cycle 1: 5-17-14-18-5
- Cycle 2: 2-19-3-15-2
- Cycle 3: 7-3-15-18-7
- Cycle 4: 0-7-3-6-0
- Cycle 5: 8-12-16-5-8
- Cycle 6: 4-17-14-5-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (2, 15), 3>
- <2, (3, 18), 15>
- <3, (6, 7), 15>
- <4, (5, 14), 17>
- <7, (0, 3), 6>
- <8, (5, 16), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles is [6].
