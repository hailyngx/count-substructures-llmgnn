Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 6) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 19) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 7) (14, 6) (2, 17) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 8, 5, 11)
- Cycle 2: (3, 6, 15, 3)
- Cycle 3: (5, 16, 8, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 4, 8, 19, 9)
- Cycle 5: (10, 6, 15, 3, 10)
- Cycle 6: (17, 10, 6, 15, 17)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 16, 13, 4)
- Cycle 8: (5, 0, 18, 12, 5)
- Cycle 9: (0, 1, 12, 18, 0)
- Cycle 10: (0, 5, 16, 13, 0)
- Cycle 11: (0, 7, 19, 8, 0)
- Cycle 12: (7, 14, 6, 15, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

From the listed cycles, the following chordal 4-cycle is found:
<7, (3, 10), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
