Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - <0, (1, 10), 4, 11, 0> => Chords: (1, 10)
        - <1, 0, 5, 10, 1>
        - <11, (3, 14), 5, 4, 11> => Chords: (3, 14)
        - <5, 0, 8, 4, 5>
        - <5, 14, 3, 0, 5>
        - <3, 14, 2, 6, 3>
        - <7, (5, 10), 6, 13, 7> => Chords: (5, 10)
        - <13, 0, 5, 7, 13>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        - As per Step 2, there are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles.
        - Therefore, the final count is [4].
