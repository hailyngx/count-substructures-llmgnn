Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
  - There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2: 
  - Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, we cannot find any chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3:
  - There are no chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
