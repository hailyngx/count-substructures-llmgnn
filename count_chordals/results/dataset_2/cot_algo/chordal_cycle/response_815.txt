Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (27, 4) (27, 22) (27, 3) (18, 4) (18, 5) (22, 27) (22, 4) (22, 12) (10, 7) (10, 28) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 3) (4, 27) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 5) (4, 26) (19, 26) (19, 28) (19, 9) (26, 4) (26, 19) (26, 23) (28, 10) (28, 19) (28, 15) (28, 20) (3, 27) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 5) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 23) (21, 17) (21, 24) (23, 26) (23, 6) (23, 29) (23, 12) (9, 19) (9, 24) (9, 20) (9, 13) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 15) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 1) (12, 22) (12, 23) (7, 10) (7, 20) (7, 14) (16, 10) (16, 3) (20, 28) (20, 9) (20, 1) (20, 7) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 25) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 15) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 3) (17, 21) (17, 24) (24, 21) (24, 9) (24, 17) (15, 28) (15, 29) (15, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (0, 5, 4, 27, 0)
- (0, 6, 1, 6, 0)
- (27, 22, 4, 27, 22)
- (27, 3, 11, 3, 27)
- (18, 5, 4, 18, 5)
- (22, 12, 23, 22)
- (10, 7, 20, 10)
- (10, 14, 13, 10)
- (10, 16, 3, 10)
- (11, 3, 16, 11)
- (4, 26, 23, 4)
- (19, 26, 23, 19)
- (19, 28, 15, 19)
- (26, 23, 12, 26)
- (28, 19, 9, 28)
- (3, 5, 4, 3)
- (6, 23, 26, 6)
- (21, 17, 24, 21)
- (23, 29, 15, 23)
- (9, 20, 7, 9)
- (9, 13, 14, 9)
- (9, 24, 17, 9)
- (29, 25, 13, 29)
- (1, 6, 23, 1)
- (2, 1, 13, 2)
- (7, 20, 28, 7)
- (12, 23, 26, 12)
- (16, 3, 5, 16)
- (14, 10, 7, 14)
- (8, 14, 13, 8)
- (25, 29, 15, 25)
- (17, 21, 24, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (6, 23), 4, 18, 5)>
- <2, (1, 13), 14, 8, 13)>
- <3, (5, 4), 26, 19, 28)>
- <7, (20, 28), 19, 9, 14)>
- <9, (13, 14), 10, 7, 20)>
- <10, (7, 20), 28, 19, 9)>
- <16, (3, 5), 4, 27, 22)>
- <17, (21, 24), 9, 13, 25)>
- <22, (12, 26), 23, 6, 1)>
- <23, (6, 1), 13, 9, 20)>
- <29, (15, 25), 13, 9, 19)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
