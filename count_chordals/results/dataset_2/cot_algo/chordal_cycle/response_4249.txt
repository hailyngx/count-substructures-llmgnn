Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 12) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 13) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 6) (5, 17) (5, 18) (19, 16) (19, 6) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 12) (9, 3) (9, 11) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 16) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 16) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 13) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 9) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 15) (16, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 1-3-14-13-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-8-17-12-1
- Cycle 3: 1-10-7-6-3-1
- Cycle 4: 1-13-14-15-8-17-12-1
- Cycle 5: 1-10-7-0-11-8-17-12-1
- Cycle 6: 3-6-19-16-8-15-14-3
- Cycle 7: 3-12-17-5-18-11-9-3
- Cycle 8: 3-9-11-0-7-10-1-4-8-3
- Cycle 9: 4-1-13-12-17-8-4
- Cycle 10: 6-19-16-8-4-1-10-7-6

Step 2:
Among these cycles, only Cycle 9: 4-1-13-12-17-8-4 contains exactly one chord, which is (1, 12).

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found = [1]

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, (1, 12), 13>.
