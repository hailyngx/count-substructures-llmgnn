Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 13) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (4, 5, 7, 3)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 9, 11, 10)
        - Cycle 3: (7, 3, 0, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (7, 3, 10, 11)
        - Cycle 5: (7, 1, 13, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (10, 3, 0, 1)
        - Cycle 7: (10, 3, 7, 1)
        - Cycle 8: (10, 5, 7, 1)
        - Cycle 9: (10, 5, 13, 1)
        - Cycle 10: (10, 8, 6, 4)
        - Cycle 11: (10, 8, 12, 13)
        - Cycle 12: (10, 11, 9, 4)
        - Cycle 13: (10, 11, 14, 13)
        - Cycle 14: (11, 9, 4, 12)
        - Cycle 15: (11, 9, 14, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1: (4, 5, 7, 3), Chord: (5, 3) => Chordal cycle <4, (5, 3), 7>
        - Cycle 2: (4, 9, 11, 10), Chord: (9, 10) => Chordal cycle <4, (9, 10), 11>
        - Cycle 3: (7, 3, 0, 1), Chord: (3, 1) => Chordal cycle <7, (3, 1), 0>
        - Cycle 4: (7, 3, 10, 11), Chord: (3, 11) => Chordal cycle <7, (3, 11), 10>
        - Cycle 5: (7, 1, 13, 5), Chord: (1, 13) => Chordal cycle <7, (1, 13), 5>
        - Cycle 10: (10, 3, 7, 1), Chord: (3, 1) => Chordal cycle <10, (3, 1), 7>
        - Cycle 13: (10, 11, 14, 13), Chord: (11, 14) => Chordal cycle <10, (11, 14), 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        [6]

Final chordal 4-cycles:
        <4, (5, 3), 7>
        <4, (9, 10), 11>
        <7, (3, 1), 0>
        <7, (3, 11), 10>
        <7, (1, 13), 5>
        <10, (11, 14), 13>
