Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 27) (4, 15) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 3) (18, 11) (18, 25) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 12) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 21) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 23) (12, 22) (12, 5) (27, 4) (27, 10) (27, 20) (6, 24) (6, 20) (28, 3) (28, 0) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 26) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 19) (10, 7) (10, 27) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 2) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 8) (23, 3) (23, 11) (23, 9) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 8) (2, 22) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 25) (20, 22) (20, 27) (20, 6) (20, 29) (29, 20) (29, 26) (25, 18) (25, 17) (25, 2) (14, 22) (14, 11) (14, 26) (14, 16) (26, 5) (26, 29) (26, 14) (26, 16) (19, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 28) (24, 6) (9, 10) (9, 23) (9, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 16) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 26) (16, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 7-21-3-1-7
- Cycle 2: 22-12-5-13-22
- Cycle 3: 27-20-6-24-27
- Cycle 4: 10-15-2-22-10
- Cycle 5: 15-4-27-10-15
- Cycle 6: 3-21-7-0-3
- Cycle 7: 11-18-25-17-11
- Cycle 8: 23-3-28-0-23
- Cycle 9: 2-22-20-29-2
- Cycle 10: 9-10-15-4-9
- Cycle 11: 16-2-25-17-16
- Cycle 12: 14-22-20-29-14
- Cycle 13: 26-5-12-22-26
- Cycle 14: 8-10-15-2-8

Step 2:
Among these cycles, only Cycle 1: 7-21-3-1-7 has exactly one chord. The chord is the edge (0, 7) connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle.

Step 3:
There is 1 chordless chordal 4-cycle in the graph, so the final answer is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<7, (0, 7), 21, 3, 1>
