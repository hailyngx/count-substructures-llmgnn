Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 9 - 2 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 3: 1 - 6 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 6 - 3 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 4 - 3 - 8 - 1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (9, 8)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (6, 4)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (4, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 5, 8, 7> with the chord (5, 8)
<0, 9, 2, 8> with the chord (9, 8)
<1, 6, 4, 1> with the chord (6, 4)
<1, 6, 3, 8> with the chord (6, 8)
<1, 4, 3, 8> with the chord (4, 8)
