Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (26, 17) (26, 3) (3, 26) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 29) (25, 14) (10, 17) (10, 22) (17, 26) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 23) (8, 27) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 24) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 16) (29, 25) (29, 17) (29, 18) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 13) (28, 21) (28, 20) (22, 9) (22, 10) (22, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (0, 1) (0, 13) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 24) (16, 6) (16, 23) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 15) (19, 25) (19, 18) (19, 24) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 20) (12, 15) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (13, 21) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 2) (27, 8) (23, 25) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 18) (23, 20) (20, 9) (20, 28) (20, 12) (20, 23) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 14) (24, 5) (24, 7) (24, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (3, 25, 14, 11, 3)
- Cycle 2: (6, 5, 7, 24, 19, 18, 29, 17, 26, 3, 11, 14, 25, 29, 18, 15, 9, 20, 28, 21, 13, 1, 0, 13, 2, 12, 22, 10, 17, 29, 25, 3, 11)
- Cycle 3: (7, 8, 27, 8)
- Cycle 4: (21, 28, 20, 9, 22, 12, 2, 3, 25, 19, 24, 5, 6, 21)
- Cycle 5: (13, 1, 0, 13)
- Cycle 6: (17, 26, 3, 25, 19, 24, 5, 7, 24, 19, 25, 29, 18, 19, 25, 14, 11, 14, 25, 19, 18, 29, 25, 3)
- Cycle 7: (18, 29, 25, 3, 26, 17, 29, 18)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: <1, 2>
- Cycle 2: <2, 3>
- Cycle 3: No chord
- Cycle 4: <4, 5>
- Cycle 5: No chord
- Cycle 6: <6, 7>
- Cycle 7: <8, 9>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are <1, 2> and <4, 5>.
