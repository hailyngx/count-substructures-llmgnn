Response:
First, let's identify all the cycles of length 4 in the given graph, which have all edges present:

1. Cycle 1: (1, 9, 0, 2)
2. Cycle 2: (1, 3, 6, 4)
3. Cycle 3: (1, 3, 8, 4)
4. Cycle 4: (1, 5, 12, 2)
5. Cycle 5: (3, 1, 5, 12)
6. Cycle 6: (3, 6, 7, 11)
7. Cycle 7: (3, 8, 12, 2)
8. Cycle 8: (4, 6, 7, 11)
9. Cycle 9: (4, 8, 12, 2)
10. Cycle 10: (8, 1, 9, 0)
11. Cycle 11: (8, 1, 5, 12)
12. Cycle 12: (8, 3, 1, 5)
13. Cycle 13: (8, 4, 13, 0)
14. Cycle 14: (8, 4, 6, 7)
15. Cycle 15: (8, 10, 14, 12)
16. Cycle 16: (8, 12, 14, 10)
17. Cycle 17: (5, 1, 9, 0)
18. Cycle 18: (5, 12, 8, 4)
19. Cycle 19: (0, 9, 1, 3)
20. Cycle 20: (0, 13, 4, 6)
21. Cycle 21: (0, 2, 12, 8)
22. Cycle 22: (7, 6, 4, 8)
23. Cycle 23: (7, 11, 12, 8)
24. Cycle 24: (7, 14, 10, 8)
25. Cycle 25: (7, 2, 0, 9)
26. Cycle 26: (2, 1, 9, 0)
27. Cycle 27: (2, 7, 11, 12)
28. Cycle 28: (2, 12, 8, 4)
29. Cycle 29: (2, 13, 0, 9)
30. Cycle 30: (12, 8, 4, 6)
31. Cycle 31: (12, 8, 10, 14)
32. Cycle 32: (12, 11, 7, 6)
33. Cycle 33: (12, 14, 10, 8)
34. Cycle 34: (11, 9, 1, 5)
35. Cycle 35: (11, 4, 13, 2)
36. Cycle 36: (11, 7, 6, 4)
37. Cycle 37: (11, 12, 8, 4)
38. Cycle 38: (14, 8, 4, 6)
39. Cycle 39: (14, 8, 12, 2)
40. Cycle 40: (14, 10, 8, 4)

Next, we will check each of these cycles for exactly one chord. After analyzing all the cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:

<1, 9, 0, 2>, with one chord (1, 5)

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
