Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles:
- Cycle 1: 1-9-7-6-1
- Cycle 2: 6-4-0-1-6
- Cycle 3: 0-5-2-4-0
- Cycle 4: 7-6-5-2-7
- Cycle 5: 1-4-2-7-1
- Cycle 6: 0-3-8-7-0
- Cycle 7: 1-0-4-6-1
- Cycle 8: 7-3-8-1-7
- Cycle 9: 2-5-6-1-2
- Cycle 10: 8-1-0-3-8
- Cycle 11: 6-7-8-3-6
- Cycle 12: 0-4-6-7-0
- Cycle 13: 7-2-5-6-7
- Cycle 14: 1-7-2-5-1
- Cycle 15: 4-0-3-8-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal Cycles:
- <1, 8, (3, 6), 1>
- <6, 7, (0, 4), 6>
- <7, 5, (2, 6), 7>
- <2, 4, (5, 7), 2>
- <5, 1, (2, 4), 5>
- <0, 3, (8, 6), 0>
- <1, 4, (6, 0), 1>
- <7, 8, (1, 3), 7>
- <2, 6, (5, 7), 2>
- <1, 5, (2, 6), 1>
- <0, 8, (3, 1), 0>
- <6, 3, (7, 8), 6>
- <0, 6, (4, 7), 0>
- <7, 2, (5, 6), 7>
- <1, 2, (4, 5), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [0] chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
