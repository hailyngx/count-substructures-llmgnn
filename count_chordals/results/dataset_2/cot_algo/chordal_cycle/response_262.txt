Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 21) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 14) (7, 2) (21, 22) (21, 7) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 3) (27, 1) (15, 23) (15, 29) (20, 19) (20, 6) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 28) (26, 19) (26, 3) (26, 4) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 16) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 14) (11, 19) (11, 23) (23, 15) (23, 11) (23, 25) (23, 16) (23, 0) (29, 15) (29, 9) (29, 4) (29, 3) (25, 27) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 23) (17, 13) (17, 24) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (0, 23) (0, 3) (0, 24) (3, 27) (3, 26) (3, 29) (3, 0) (5, 8) (5, 28) (5, 16) (24, 7) (24, 17) (24, 0) (1, 27) (1, 10) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 16) (4, 26) (4, 29) (4, 10) (16, 22) (16, 6) (16, 23) (16, 5) (16, 14) (28, 27) (28, 19) (28, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 

- Cycle 1: (13, 22, 21, 7) 
- Cycle 2: (13, 22, 16, 6)
- Cycle 3: (13, 19, 26, 3)
- Cycle 4: (13, 19, 28, 5)
- Cycle 5: (22, 21, 7, 14)
- Cycle 6: (22, 16, 6, 20)
- Cycle 7: (22, 21, 7, 24)
- Cycle 8: (7, 21, 22, 16)
- Cycle 9: (7, 14, 16, 22)
- Cycle 10: (21, 22, 16, 5)
- Cycle 11: (12, 27, 3, 26)
- Cycle 12: (12, 27, 1, 10)
- Cycle 13: (27, 12, 27, 25)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord: 

- Chordal 4-cycles: 
  - <1, (13, 19), 26>
  - <2, (13, 22), 21>
  - <3, (22, 16), 6>
  - <4, (22, 21), 7>
  - <5, (22, 16), 20>
  - <6, (21, 7), 14>
  - <7, (21, 22), 16>
  - <8, (7, 21), 22>
  - <9, (7, 14), 16>
  - <10, (21, 22), 5>
  - <11, (12, 27), 3>
  - <12, (12, 27), 1>
  - <13, (27, 12), 27> 

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 

- There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [13].
