Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 23) (15, 5) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (25, 26) (25, 23) (25, 28) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 0) (21, 0) (21, 26) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 18) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 18) (4, 15) (4, 22) (4, 24) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 14) (12, 7) (19, 17) (26, 25) (26, 21) (16, 7) (16, 28) (16, 9) (16, 10) (28, 25) (28, 1) (28, 16) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 6) (2, 9) (2, 22) (2, 20) (2, 11) (22, 8) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 24) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 5) (6, 18) (6, 27) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 10) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 10) (10, 16) (10, 29) (10, 20) (27, 6) (24, 4) (24, 22) (24, 20) (5, 15) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 29) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 25) (23, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:   
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:   
- There are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Step 3:   
- Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles found in the graph is [0].
