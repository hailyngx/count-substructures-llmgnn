Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (3, 7, 0, 2, 3)
        - Cycle 2: (3, 7, 6, 2, 3)
        - Cycle 3: (3, 7, 0, 6, 3)
        - Cycle 4: (3, 7, 0, 5, 3)
        - Cycle 5: (0, 7, 6, 2, 0)
        - Cycle 6: (0, 7, 6, 8, 0)
        - Cycle 7: (0, 7, 5, 2, 0)
        - Cycle 8: (0, 7, 5, 6, 0)
        - Cycle 9: (2, 4, 7, 5, 2)
        - Cycle 10: (2, 4, 7, 0, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <3, (0, 2), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - Total number of chordless cycles: [9]
