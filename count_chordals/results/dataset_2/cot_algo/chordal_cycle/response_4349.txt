Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 0, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 0, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 0, 1, 5, 7, 9)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 0, 9, 6, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 3, 2, 9, 0, 4)
- Cycle 6: (7, 5, 1, 6, 9, 7)
- Cycle 7: (6, 9, 0, 1, 5, 6)
- Cycle 8: (1, 2, 3, 0, 7, 1)
- Cycle 9: (3, 5, 7, 4, 9, 3)

Step 2:
Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (0, 1)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (3, 2)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (0, 9)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (2, 3)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (5, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- 9 chordal 4-cycles were found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, (5, 6)>
<7, (5, 7)>
<9, (0, 1)>
<4, (6, 9)>
<3, (3, 2)>
<6, (1, 6)>
<5, (0, 9)>
<1, (2, 3)>
<9, (5, 4)>
