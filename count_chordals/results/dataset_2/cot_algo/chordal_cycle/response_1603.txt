Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Potential cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-8-4-9-0
- Cycle 2: 0-8-4-6-1-7-5-0
- Cycle 3: 3-0-8-5-7-1-6-14-3
- Cycle 4: 11-0-8-4-6-1-13-11
- Cycle 5: 11-0-3-14-13-1-6-9-11

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has no chords
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 5 has no chords

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 3

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, (8, 5), 7>
