Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (17, 8) (17, 7) (5, 15) (5, 0) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 1) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (19, 8) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 16) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 15) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 1) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 13) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 14) (15, 5) (15, 2) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 13) 

Response:
The number of chordless 4-cycles in this graph is [20].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4, 8> - chord: (1, 4)
<0, 1, 11, 10> - chord: (1, 11)
<0, 5, 15, 2> - chord: (5, 15)
<1, 8, 12, 4> - chord: (8, 12)
<2, 3, 11, 10> - chord: (2, 11)
<2, 16, 12, 4> - chord: (2, 12)
<7, 3, 11, 10> - chord: (3, 11)
<7, 10, 14, 13> - chord: (10, 14)
<7, 13, 16, 2> - chord: (13, 16)
<10, 11, 1, 0> - chord: (11, 1)
<10, 14, 13, 7> - chord: (14, 13)
<13, 16, 12, 4> - chord: (13, 12)
<14, 10, 11, 3> - chord: (10, 11)
<15, 5, 0, 1> - chord: (5, 1)
<16, 2, 3, 7> - chord: (2, 3)
<17, 7, 10, 11> - chord: (7, 10)
<17, 7, 14, 10> - chord: (7, 14)
<18, 4, 1, 0> - chord: (4, 1)
<19, 8, 12, 16> - chord: (8, 12)
<12, 4, 1, 0> - chord: (4, 1)
<19, 8, 17, 7> - chord: (8, 17)
