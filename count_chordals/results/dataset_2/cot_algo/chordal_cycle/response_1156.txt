Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: {4, 7, 0, 9, 4}
- Cycle 2: {4, 9, 6, 5, 4}
- Cycle 3: {4, 5, 3, 2, 4}
- Cycle 4: {7, 0, 8, 9, 7}
- Cycle 5: {6, 9, 3, 5, 6}
- Cycle 6: {6, 5, 2, 1, 6}

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has the chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 2 has the chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 3 has the chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 4 has the chord (0, 8)
- Cycle 5 has the chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 6 has the chord (5, 1)

Step 3:
Counting chordal 4-cycles: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (7, 9)>
<2, (9, 5)>
<3, (5, 3)>
<4, (0, 8)>
<5, (9, 5)>
<6, (5, 1)>
