Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 4) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 8) 

Response:
Let's go through the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 6-9-1-6
- Cycle 2: 6-1-11-7
- Cycle 3: 6-10-2-12
- Cycle 4: 6-13-5-1
- Cycle 5: 9-6-7-12
- Cycle 6: 9-8-10-2
- Cycle 7: 9-1-11-5
- Cycle 8: 10-6-7-12
- Cycle 9: 10-11-5-13
- Cycle 10: 10-8-2-4
- Cycle 11: 11-7-12-4
- Cycle 12: 11-5-13-4
- Cycle 13: 7-12-4-13
- Cycle 14: 7-11-5-13
- Cycle 15: 2-10-11-1
- Cycle 16: 2-8-9-1
- Cycle 17: 2-4-12-7
- Cycle 18: 8-9-6-7
- Cycle 19: 8-10-6-1
- Cycle 20: 8-5-13-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: Chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 2: Chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 3: Chord (10, 12)
- Cycle 4: Chord (13, 5)
- Cycle 5: Chord (6, 12)
- Cycle 6: Chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 7: Chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 8: Chord (6, 12)
- Cycle 9: Chord (10, 13)
- Cycle 10: Chord (8, 2)
- Cycle 11: Chord (5, 12)
- Cycle 12: Chord (7, 13)
- Cycle 13: Chord (11, 4)
- Cycle 14: Chord (5, 12)
- Cycle 15: Chord (10, 1)
- Cycle 16: Chord (8, 9)
- Cycle 17: Chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 18: Chord (8, 7)
- Cycle 19: Chord (6, 10)
- Cycle 20: Chord (8, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [20]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [20]. The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:

<6, (9, 1), 1, 7, 11>
