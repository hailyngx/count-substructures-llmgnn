Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (11, 19) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 15) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (9, 0) (9, 19) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 13) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 13) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 18) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (0, 8, 15, 7, 0)
- (0, 8, 15, 16, 0)
- (0, 8, 15, 19, 0)
- (0, 9, 19, 15, 0)
- (1, 2, 12, 3, 1)
- (1, 5, 17, 18, 1)
- (2, 10, 12, 3, 2)
- (3, 7, 14, 6, 3)
- (3, 12, 2, 10, 3)
- (3, 12, 16, 15, 3)
- (3, 12, 16, 17, 3)
- (3, 13, 18, 17, 3)
- (3, 13, 19, 9, 3)
- (4, 8, 15, 16, 4)
- (4, 13, 18, 17, 4)
- (5, 6, 14, 7, 5)
- (5, 17, 18, 13, 5)
- (7, 14, 4, 8, 7)
- (7, 15, 8, 0, 7)
- (8, 15, 16, 17, 8)
- (8, 15, 19, 9, 8)
- (13, 18, 17, 5, 13)
- (13, 19, 9, 0, 13)


Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 5, {17}, 18>
- <3, 7, {14}, 6>
- <3, 13, {18}, 17>
- <4, 8, {15}, 16>
- <7, 14, {4}, 8>


Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 21 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
