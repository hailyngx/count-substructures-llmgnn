Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 11) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 1) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 13 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 4 - 0 - 14 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 8 - 2 - 10 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 12 - 1 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 5: 9 - 10 - 4 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 1 - 2 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 7: 4 - 0 - 14 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 8: 8 - 2 - 10 - 5 - 8
- Cycle 9: 0 - 4 - 10 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 10: 14 - 0 - 4 - 5 - 14
- Cycle 11: 2 - 8 - 12 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 12: 5 - 4 - 6 - 12 - 5
- Cycle 13: 13 - 9 - 1 - 12 - 13
- Cycle 14: 12 - 1 - 7 - 14 - 12
- Cycle 15: 3 - 13 - 5 - 10 - 3
- Cycle 16: 7 - 14 - 13 - 9 - 7
- Cycle 17: 1 - 9 - 7 - 14 - 1
- Cycle 18: 11 - 8 - 2 - 1 - 11

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, we find that Cycle 14: 12 - 1 - 7 - 14 - 12 has exactly one chord (edges 1-14), and hence is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<12, (1, 14), 7>
