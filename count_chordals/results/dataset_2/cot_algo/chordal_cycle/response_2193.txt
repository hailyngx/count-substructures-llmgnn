Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 14) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 8) (10, 9) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 3 - 7 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 3 - 11 - 13 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 6 - 9 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 4: 1 - 7 - 8 - 11 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 7 - 12 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 10 - 9 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 7: 2 - 0 - 3 - 11 - 2
- Cycle 8: 2 - 0 - 4 - 12 - 2
- Cycle 9: 2 - 4 - 14 - 8 - 2
- Cycle 10: 4 - 0 - 6 - 12 - 4
- Cycle 11: 4 - 2 - 8 - 14 - 4
- Cycle 12: 5 - 12 - 6 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 13: 9 - 6 - 0 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 14: 9 - 10 - 1 - 7 - 9
- Cycle 15: 8 - 11 - 3 - 7 - 8

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (5, 12), 7>
- <2, (0, 4), 12>
- <4, (6, 12), 0>
- <9, (1, 7), 10>
- <8, (3, 7), 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
- Total = 5, so [5].
