Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 11) (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 19) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 15) (18, 19) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 11) (16, 9) (16, 0) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 11) (1, 13) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 19) (14, 8) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 10, 7, 13, 8) with the edges (3, 15), (15, 10), (10, 7), (7, 13), (13, 8), (8, 3) present.
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 18, 19, 12, 7) with the edges (3, 15), (15, 18), (18, 19), (19, 12), (12, 7), (7, 3) present.
- Cycle 3: (3, 15, 10, 7, 12, 14) with the edges (3, 15), (15, 10), (10, 7), (7, 12), (12, 14), (14, 3) present.
- Cycle 4: (3, 15, 18, 19, 11, 0) with the edges (3, 15), (15, 18), (18, 19), (19, 11), (11, 0), (0, 3) present.
- Cycle 5: (3, 6, 17, 13, 8) with the edges (3, 6), (6, 17), (17, 13), (13, 8), (8, 3) present.
- Cycle 6: (3, 6, 17, 4, 5) with the edges (3, 6), (6, 17), (17, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3) present.
- Cycle 7: (7, 13, 17, 4, 5) with the edges (7, 13), (13, 17), (17, 4), (4, 5), (5, 7) present.

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Considering Cycle 1: (3, 15, 10, 7, 13, 8), the chord (7, 8) is present.
- Considering Cycle 2: (3, 15, 18, 19, 12, 7), the chord (18, 7) is present.
- Considering Cycle 3: (3, 15, 10, 7, 12, 14), the chord (10, 14) is present.
- Considering Cycle 4: (3, 15, 18, 19, 11, 0), the chords (18, 11) and (15, 0) are present.
- Considering Cycle 5: (3, 6, 17, 13, 8), the chord (6, 13) is present.
- Considering Cycle 6: (3, 6, 17, 4, 5), there are no chords present.
- Considering Cycle 7: (7, 13, 17, 4, 5), there are no chords present.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found are: 
- <1, (7, 8)>
- <2, (18, 7)>
- <3, (10, 14)>
- <4, (6, 13)>
