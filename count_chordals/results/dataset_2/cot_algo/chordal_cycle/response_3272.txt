Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 25) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 7) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 18) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 22) (27, 17) (27, 12) (5, 19) (5, 10) (6, 3) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 29) (22, 12) (22, 26) (26, 22) (26, 29) (26, 3) (26, 4) (0, 17) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 24) (24, 19) (24, 2) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 11) (23, 1) (23, 29) (23, 10) (9, 29) (9, 2) (9, 28) (29, 7) (29, 26) (29, 23) (29, 9) (3, 6) (3, 26) (3, 28) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 15) (1, 23) (1, 16) (1, 10) (20, 2) (21, 14) (21, 18) (2, 24) (2, 9) (2, 20) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 15) (10, 5) (10, 23) (10, 1) (10, 16) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 18) (4, 26) (4, 11) (4, 15) (15, 13) (15, 28) (15, 16) (15, 4) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 13-17-14-25-13
- Cycle 2: 12-27-17-14-21-18-12
- Cycle 3: 2-20-9-28-3-26-22-12-11-19-24-2
- Cycle 4: 15-13-17-7-29-26-3-6-15

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, only Cycle 1 (13-17-14-25-13) has exactly one chord (14-25).

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<13, 25, 14, 17>
