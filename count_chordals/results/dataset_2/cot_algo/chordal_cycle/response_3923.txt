Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- <0, 9, 5, 1>
- <1, 5, 9, 0>
- <2, 3, 9, 0>
- <3, 6, 10, 4>
- <4, 5, 9, 0>
- <5, 9, 3, 10>
- <7, 0, 9, 5>
- <8, 11, 0, 9>
- <9, 12, 4, 5>
- <10, 3, 9, 12>
- <11, 0, 9, 5>
- <12, 4, 5, 9>
- <13, 3, 9, 5>
- <14, 5, 9, 0>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <0, 9, 5, 1, (11, 4)>
- <2, 3, 9, 0, (10, 6)>
- <3, 6, 10, 4, (9, 12)>
- <5, 9, 3, 10, (4, 0)>
- <7, 0, 9, 5, (3, 13)>
- <8, 11, 0, 9, (4, 12)>
- <9, 12, 4, 5, (0, 1)>
- <10, 3, 9, 12, (4, 5)>
- <11, 0, 9, 5, (1, 8)>
- <13, 3, 9, 5, (14, 12)>
- <14, 5, 9, 0, (1, 11)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
