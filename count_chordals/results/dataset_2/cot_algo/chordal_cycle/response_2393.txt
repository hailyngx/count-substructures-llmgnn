Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-2-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-9-8-0
- Cycle 3: 1-4-0-5-1
- Cycle 4: 2-5-0-4-2
- Cycle 5: 2-5-9-8-2
- Cycle 6: 3-5-0-4-3
- Cycle 7: 3-5-9-8-3
- Cycle 8: 6-9-8-2-6
- Cycle 9: 6-9-5-0-6
- Cycle 10: 7-2-5-0-7
- Cycle 11: 7-2-8-9-7
- Cycle 12: 8-9-5-0-8

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-9-8-0, Chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 2: 6-9-8-2-6, Chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 3: 7-2-8-9-7, Chord: (2, 9)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
- <0, 5, 9, 8>
- <6, 9, 8, 2>
- <7, 2, 8, 9>
