Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (3, 7) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- (5, 13, 12, 9)  
- (8, 4, 6, 14)  
- (10, 8, 4, 11)  
- (7, 5, 11, 10)  
- (0, 8, 10, 12)  
- (1, 8, 7, 3)  
- (2, 5, 7, 12)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).  
- <5, 7, 13, 9> (Chord: (5, 9))  
- <8, 4, 10, 11> (Chord: (8, 11))  
- <10, 8, 4, 11> (Chord: (10, 4))  
- <7, 5, 11, 10> (Chord: (7, 11))  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
- There are 1 chordless cycle: <8, 4, 6, 14>

Putting it all together, the final answer is [1].
