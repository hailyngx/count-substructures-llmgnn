Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 1>, Chord: (6, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 9, 12, 6>, Chord: (9, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 4, 8, 2>, Chord: (4, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 4, 0, 6>, Chord: (4, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, 12, 6, 1>, Chord: (6, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, 1, 5, 13>, Chord: (1, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, 8, 1, 2>, Chord: (1, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, 0, 6, 9>, Chord: (0, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <8, 2, 1, 5>, Chord: (1, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <2, 13, 5, 9>, Chord: (5, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <13, 0, 6, 9>, Chord: (0, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <3, 14, 9, 5>, Chord: (9, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <11, 4, 8, 5>, Chord: (4, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <1, 5, 13, 2>, Chord: (1, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <0, 6, 9, 12>, Chord: (6, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <10, 8, 2, 13>, Chord: (8, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <14, 9, 5, 13>, Chord: (9, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found. 

There are 17 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the answer is [17].
