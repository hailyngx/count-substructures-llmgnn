Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <1, 4, 7, 2, 1>
2. <1, 4, 8, 9, 1>
3. <1, 4, 5, 0, 1>
4. <1, 2, 6, 3, 1>
5. <1, 2, 7, 5, 1>
6. <1, 0, 3, 6, 1>
7. <1, 0, 5, 2, 1>
8. <3, 6, 2, 7, 3>
9. <3, 6, 2, 5, 3>
10. <6, 2, 7, 5, 6>

Step 2:
Checking each of the above cycles for exactly one chord:
- <1, 4, 7, 2, 1> has chord (4, 2)
- <1, 4, 8, 9, 1> has chord (4, 9)
- <1, 4, 5, 0, 1> has chord (4, 0)
- <1, 2, 6, 3, 1> has chord (2, 6)
- <1, 2, 7, 5, 1> has chord (2, 5)
- <1, 0, 3, 6, 1> has chord (0, 3)
- <1, 0, 5, 2, 1> has chord (0, 5)
- <3, 6, 2, 7, 3> has chord (6, 7)
- <3, 6, 2, 5, 3> has chord (6, 5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (4, 2), 7>
<1, (4, 9), 8>
<1, (4, 0), 5>
<1, (2, 6), 3>
<1, (2, 5), 7>
<1, (0, 3), 6>
<1, (0, 5), 2>
<3, (6, 7), 2>
<3, (6, 5), 2>
