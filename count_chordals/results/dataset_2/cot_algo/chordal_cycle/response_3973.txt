Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 1-4-2-5-1 
- Cycle 2: 1-4-8-9-1 
- Cycle 3: 2-4-8-7-2 
- Cycle 4: 2-7-8-9-2 
- Cycle 5: 3-1-4-8-3 
- Cycle 6: 3-6-7-8-3 
- Cycle 7: 3-8-9-2-3 
- Cycle 8: 3-2-4-5-3 
- Cycle 9: 5-2-4-1-5 
- Cycle 10: 5-9-8-7-5 
- Cycle 11: 5-4-8-7-5 

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord are:
<1, (4, 8), 9> 
<2, (7, 8), 9> 
<3, (1, 8), 4> 
<3, (6, 7), 8> 
<3, (2, 9), 8> 
<5, (2, 4), 1> 
<5, (8, 7), 9> 

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found gives [7].
