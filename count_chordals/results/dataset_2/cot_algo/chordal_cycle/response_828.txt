- Cycle 24: <6, 11, 13, 4>  
- Cycle 25: <6, 8, 9, 3>  
- Cycle 26: <2, 1, 6, 8>  
- Cycle 27: <2, 14, 0, 13>  
- Cycle 28: <2, 5, 10, 4>  
- Cycle 29: <2, 8, 6, 1>  
- Cycle 30: <8, 7, 10, 4>  
- Cycle 31: <8, 12, 13, 11>  
- Cycle 32: <8, 6, 1, 3>  
- Cycle 33: <8, 2, 5, 10>  
- Cycle 34: <13, 12, 8, 6>  
- Cycle 35: <13, 0, 10, 4>  
- Cycle 36: <13, 5, 2, 8>  
- Cycle 37: <13, 4, 11, 7>  
- Cycle 38: <11, 3, 1, 2>  
- Cycle 39: <11, 7, 10, 4>  
- Cycle 40: <11, 6, 8, 12>  
- Cycle 41: <11, 13, 12, 5>  
- Cycle 42: <11, 4, 13, 0>  
- Cycle 43: <9, 3, 1, 2>  
- Cycle 44: <9, 8, 6, 4>  
- Cycle 45: <10, 7, 3, 1>  
- Cycle 46: <10, 0, 14, 2>  
- Cycle 47: <10, 5, 12, 8>  
- Cycle 48: <10, 4, 11, 13>  
- Cycle 49: <4, 6, 8, 12>  
- Cycle 50: <4, 13, 12, 8>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- In cycle <1, 3, 7, 11>, the chord is (3, 7).  
- In cycle <1, 3, 14, 0>, the chord is (1, 14).  

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.  
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [2].
