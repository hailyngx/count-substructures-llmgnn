Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 19) (15, 19) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 19) (6, 18) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 11) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 12) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 11) (19, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 0) (11, 12) (11, 19) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 19) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-7-4-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-7-4-10-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-8-4-7-0
- Cycle 4: 0-2-8-16-14-0
- Cycle 5: 3-17-14-0-2-3
- Cycle 6: 3-17-14-16-8-2-3
- Cycle 7: 3-9-8-16-14-17-3
- Cycle 8: 11-12-18-16-14-17-11
- Cycle 9: 11-12-18-16-8-4-7-0-2-13-12
- Cycle 10: 11-12-18-16-8-9-19-15-11
- Cycle 11: 11-12-13-2-0-14-17-3-9-19-11

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 7, 8, 4, (4, 10)>
- <0, 2, 8, 16, (2, 14)>
- <3, 17, 14, 0, (17, 4)>
- <3, 17, 14, 16, (14, 8)>
- <3, 9, 8, 16, (8, 14)>
- <11, 12, 18, 16, (12, 14)>
- <11, 12, 13, 2, (12, 0)>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [7].
