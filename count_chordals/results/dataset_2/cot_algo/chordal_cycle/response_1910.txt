Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
Here are the cycles:
1. Cycle: 0 - 6 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 0
2. Cycle: 0 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 0
3. Cycle: 0 - 6 - 7 - 1 - 0
4. Cycle: 0 - 4 - 3 - 7 - 0
5. Cycle: 0 - 4 - 5 - 8 - 0
6. Cycle: 0 - 7 - 8 - 5 - 0
7. Cycle: 1 - 7 - 9 - 2 - 1
8. Cycle: 1 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 1
9. Cycle: 2 - 9 - 0 - 6 - 2
10. Cycle: 3 - 4 - 5 - 8 - 3
11. Cycle: 3 - 4 - 0 - 9 - 3
12. Cycle: 3 - 4 - 5 - 1 - 3
13. Cycle: 3 - 7 - 8 - 5 - 3
14. Cycle: 3 - 7 - 0 - 9 - 3
15. Cycle: 3 - 2 - 9 - 7 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
From the cycles above, the cycle 0 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 0 contains exactly one chord (5, 4).
Thus, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <0, 6, 5, 4>. 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [14].
