Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-3-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-6-8-0
- Cycle 3: 0-8-9-6-0
- Cycle 4: 1-7-5-3-1
- Cycle 5: 1-2-3-5-1
- Cycle 6: 1-3-6-4-1
- Cycle 7: 1-9-6-8-1
- Cycle 8: 2-1-3-2
- Cycle 9: 2-3-4-2
- Cycle 10: 2-7-5-1-2
- Cycle 11: 2-9-1-2
- Cycle 12: 3-1-2-3
- Cycle 13: 3-4-6-8-3
- Cycle 14: 3-5-7-1-3
- Cycle 15: 3-6-9-1-3
- Cycle 16: 4-0-6-4
- Cycle 17: 4-3-1-4
- Cycle 18: 4-6-9-4
- Cycle 19: 5-0-8-6-5
- Cycle 20: 5-3-6-9-5
- Cycle 21: 5-7-1-3-5
- Cycle 22: 5-8-0-5
- Cycle 23: 6-0-8-9-6
- Cycle 24: 7-1-3-5-7
- Cycle 25: 7-2-1-7
- Cycle 26: 8-0-4-6-8
- Cycle 27: 8-6-9-1-8
- Cycle 28: 9-1-2-3-9
- Cycle 29: 9-2-7-5-9

Step 2: 
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <3, (1, 6), 4> (Chord: 1-6)
- <9, (6, 8), 1> (Chord: 6-8)
- <9, (1, 6), 8> (Chord: 1-6)

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found = 29 - 3 = 26

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [26].
