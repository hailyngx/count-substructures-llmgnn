Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 19) (3, 18) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 15) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 11) (15, 1) (15, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 19) (16, 14) (16, 18) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 19, 5, 10, 6)
- Cycle 2: (14, 17, 2, 7, 11, 14)
- Cycle 3: (12, 9, 19, 1, 15, 13, 12)
- Cycle 4: (12, 9, 19, 11, 14, 16, 18, 0, 12)
- Cycle 5: (12, 9, 19, 11, 7, 5, 10, 6, 12)
- Cycle 6: (14, 17, 11, 4, 12, 0, 8, 2, 14)
- Cycle 7: (17, 11, 4, 12, 13, 15, 1, 19, 17)
- Cycle 8: (17, 11, 4, 12, 0, 18, 16, 14, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has a chord (19, 10)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (2, 14)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (19, 15)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (9, 0)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (19, 6)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (12, 8)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (11, 19)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (4, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (10, 19), 5, 6>
- <2, (14, 7), 11, 17>
- <9, (15, 19), 13, 12>
- <0, (18, 9), 12, 19>
- <6, (19, 6), 12, 9>
- <8, (12, 8), 14, 17>
- <17, (19, 11), 7, 4>
- <4, (17, 4), 12, 11>
