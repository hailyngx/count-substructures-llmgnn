Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

        - Cycle 1: (1, 3, 7, 25)
        - Cycle 2: (1, 3, 0, 6)
        - Cycle 3: (1, 27, 22, 26)
        - Cycle 4: (1, 23, 14, 19)
        - Cycle 5: (3, 7, 18, 28)
        - Cycle 6: (3, 0, 16, 28)
        - Cycle 7: (6, 28, 24, 13)
        - Cycle 8: (6, 0, 2, 17)
        - Cycle 9: (22, 26, 15, 27)
        - Cycle 10: (22, 27, 25, 13)
        - Cycle 11: (26, 22, 27, 1)
        - Cycle 12: (25, 7, 3, 1)
        - Cycle 13: (11, 9, 10, 5)
        - Cycle 14: (11, 17, 2, 0)
        - Cycle 15: (11, 20, 12, 23)
        - Cycle 16: (17, 2, 0, 3)
        - Cycle 17: (17, 2, 9, 11)
        - Cycle 18: (29, 21, 18, 7)
        - Cycle 19: (10, 9, 11, 20)
        - Cycle 20: (10, 5, 4, 12)
        - Cycle 21: (21, 29, 27, 22)
        - Cycle 22: (2, 0, 3, 1)
        - Cycle 23: (2, 17, 11, 9)
        - Cycle 24: (2, 9, 13, 20)
        - Cycle 25: (4, 12, 8, 25)
        - Cycle 26: (12, 20, 7, 3)
        - Cycle 27: (12, 8, 25, 27)
        - Cycle 28: (12, 23, 14, 19)
        - Cycle 29: (27, 25, 8, 12)
        - Cycle 30: (13, 24, 18, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

        - Cycle 5: (1, 3, 7, 25) with chord (3, 25)
        - Cycle 19: (10, 9, 11, 20) with chord (9, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

        There are [28] chordless cycles found.

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
        <5, (3, 25)>
        <19, (9, 11)>
