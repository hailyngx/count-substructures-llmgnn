Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 12) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (2, 5) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 4) (1, 9) (18, 3) (18, 17) (18, 0) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 10 - 7 - 0 - 6 - 10
- Cycle 2: 16 - 11 - 10 - 12 - 16
- Cycle 3: 9 - 8 - 19 - 5 - 9

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Cycle 1: 10 - 7 - 0 - 6 - 10 has exactly one chord (7,0). This forms a chordal 4-cycle.
   <10, 7, 0, 6>
- Cycle 2: 16 - 11 - 10 - 12 - 16 has no chord.
- Cycle 3: 9 - 8 - 19 - 5 - 9 has no chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <10, 7, 0, 6>.
