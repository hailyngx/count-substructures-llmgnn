Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 8) (2, 7) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 1) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 12) (14, 16) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 18) (19, 12) (19, 15) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (4, 10) (4, 16) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 6) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 1, 12>
- <0, 5, 8, 17>
- <5, 0, 6, 16>
- <5, 1, 12, 19>
- <1, 5, 8, 17>
- <1, 5, 18, 19>
- <5, 8, 17, 10>
- <5, 8, 9, 15>
- <8, 5, 1, 12>
- <8, 5, 17, 10>
- <8, 5, 18, 19>
- <8, 9, 10, 17>
- <9, 8, 5, 1>
- <9, 8, 17, 10>
- <9, 8, 5, 18>
- <9, 10, 17, 8>
- <10, 17, 8, 5>
- <10, 17, 11, 8>
- <17, 8, 11, 10>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, (5, 8), 17>
- <1, (5, 8), 17>
- <5, (8, 17), 10>
- <8, (9, 10), 17>

Step 3:
There are a total of [4] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
