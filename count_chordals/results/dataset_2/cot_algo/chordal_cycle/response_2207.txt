Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 10, 8, 6)
- Cycle 2: (9, 10, 13, 5, 9)
- Cycle 3: (10, 11, 14, 7, 10)
- Cycle 4: (8, 10, 13, 12, 8)
- Cycle 5: (13, 5, 12, 2, 13)
- Cycle 6: (5, 13, 2, 4, 5)
- Cycle 7: (7, 9, 2, 14, 7)
- Cycle 8: (12, 13, 2, 14, 12)
- Cycle 9: (3, 11, 10, 0, 3)
- Cycle 10: (0, 10, 8, 3, 0)
- Cycle 11: (11, 14, 7, 1, 11)
- Cycle 12: (2, 13, 10, 9, 2)
- Cycle 13: Not possible with the given edges.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 <chord (10, 8)>: <1, (10, 8), 6>
- Cycle 2 <chord (13, 5)>: <2, (13, 5), 9>
- Cycle 3 <chord (14, 7)>: <3, (14, 7), 10>
- Cycle 4 <chord (13, 12)>: <4, (13, 12), 8>
- Cycle 5 <chord (5, 12)>: <5, (5, 12), 13>
- Cycle 6 <chord (2, 4)>: <6, (2, 4), 5>
- Cycle 7 <chord (2, 14)>: <7, (2, 14), 9>
- Cycle 8 <chord (2, 14)>: <8, (2, 14), 12>
- Cycle 9 <chord (10, 8)>: <9, (10, 8), 0>
- Cycle 10 <chord (10, 8)>: <10, (10, 8), 3>
- Cycle 11 <chord (14, 7)>: <11, (14, 7), 11>
- Cycle 12 <chord (10, 9)>: <12, (10, 9), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
