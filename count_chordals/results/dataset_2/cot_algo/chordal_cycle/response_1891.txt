Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 3, 1, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 2, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 4, 1, 3, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 9, 0, 3, 4, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 9, 3, 0, 4, 6)
- Cycle 6: (9, 3, 1, 4, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 4, 1, 3, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 1, 3, 2, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 3, 2, 1, 9)
- Cycle 10: (1, 3, 2, 9, 1)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 is chordal with chord (3, 1)
- Cycle 2 is chordal with chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 4 is chordal with chord (6, 4)
- Cycle 5 is chordal with chord (6, 0)
- Cycle 6 is chordal with chord (3, 1)
- Cycle 7 is chordal with chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 8 is chordal with chord (3, 2)
- Cycle 9 is chordal with chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 10 is chordal with chord (3, 2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <6, (3, 1), 9>
