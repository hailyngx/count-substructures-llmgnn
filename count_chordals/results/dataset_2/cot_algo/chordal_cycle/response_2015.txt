Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) (4, 13) (4, 18) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 19) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 17) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (6, 12) (6, 5) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 11) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 11) (17, 0) (10, 7) (10, 16)

- Cycle 6: 1-0-13-18-1
- Cycle 7: 3-1-15-7-3
- Cycle 8: 3-1-16-7-3
- Cycle 9: 3-9-8-13-3
- Cycle 10: 3-9-8-13-18-3
- Cycle 11: 3-18-13-0-3
- Cycle 12: 3-18-13-4-3
- Cycle 13: 7-15-0-17-7
- Cycle 14: 7-12-6-5-7
- Cycle 15: 7-12-6-19-7

- Cycle 22: 12-6-5-19-12
- Cycle 23: 12-6-19-16-12
- Cycle 24: 12-19-16-10-12
- Cycle 25: 0-1-15-7-0
- Cycle 26: 0-13-8-9-0
- Cycle 27: 0-13-8-9-3-0
- Cycle 28: 0-13-4-18-0
- Cycle 29: 13-8-9-3-13
- Cycle 30: 13-8-9-3-18-13
- Cycle 31: 13-4-18-3-13
- Cycle 32: 13-18-3-1-13
- Cycle 33: 4-13-18-3-4
- Cycle 34: 4-18-3-1-4
- Cycle 35: 18-13-4-1-18
- Cycle 36: 7-12-19-16-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 8), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [35]
