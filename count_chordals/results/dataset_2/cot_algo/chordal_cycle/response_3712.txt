Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (13, 6) (13, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 3, 1, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 3, 1, 10, 7, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 4, 7, 10, 1, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 13, 9, 14, 7, 6)
- Cycle 5: (7, 4, 8, 12, 10, 7)
- Cycle 6: (9, 6, 4, 8, 14, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 13, 6, 4, 8, 9)
- Cycle 8: (3, 9, 14, 8, 11, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 6, 4, 5, 3, 9)
- Cycle 10: (3, 1, 4, 5, 11, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 5, 11, 2, 7, 3)
- Cycle 12: (10, 7, 4, 8, 12, 10)
- Cycle 13: (10, 1, 3, 5, 11, 10)
- Cycle 14: (11, 8, 14, 9, 13, 11)
- Cycle 15: (11, 3, 1, 10, 12, 11)
- Cycle 16: (8, 11, 3, 1, 4, 8)
- Cycle 17: (8, 5, 11, 3, 1, 8)
- Cycle 18: (12, 10, 1, 3, 5, 12)
- Cycle 19: (0, 9, 13, 6, 4, 0)
- Cycle 20: (14, 9, 6, 3, 11, 14)
- Cycle 21: (14, 7, 4, 5, 3, 14)
- Cycle 22: (5, 4, 6, 3, 11, 5)
- Cycle 23: (5, 3, 6, 9, 13, 5)
- Cycle 24: (5, 8, 14, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 25: (2, 7, 4, 1, 3, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The unique chordal 4-cycle is <6, (9, 13), 4, 7>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There is only 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
