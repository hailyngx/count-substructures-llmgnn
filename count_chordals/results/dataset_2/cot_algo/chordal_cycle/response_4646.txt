Step 2:  
        - Possible chordal 4-cycles: <15, 13, 5, 2> with one chord (5, 13)
        - Possible chordal 4-cycles: <15, 4, 6, 0> with one chord (6, 4)
        - Possible chordal 4-cycles: <15, 11, 14, 4> with one chord (11, 14)
        - Possible chordal 4-cycles: <15, 13, 25, 10> with one chord (13, 25)
        - Possible chordal 4-cycles: <20, 9, 10, 21> with one chord (9, 10)
        - Possible chordal 4-cycles: <17, 24, 27, 22> with one chord (24, 27)
        - Possible chordal 4-cycles: <6, 0, 16, 22> with one chord (0, 16)
        
Step 3: 
        So, the total number of chordal 4-cycles found is [7].
