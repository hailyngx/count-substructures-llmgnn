Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 13) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-11-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-0-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-14-4-9-1
- Cycle 4: 3-14-4-9-3
- Cycle 5: 10-8-0-2-10
- Cycle 6: 10-14-4-9-10
- Cycle 7: 2-13-1-5-2
- Cycle 8: 2-5-11-3-2
- Cycle 9: 2-0-8-6-2
- Cycle 10: 4-9-7-12-4
- Cycle 11: 13-4-14-0-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are:
1. <1, 5, 11, (3, 14), 1>
2. <1, 0, 2, (5, 1), 1>
3. <1, 9, 4, (14, 4), 1>
4. <3, 9, 4, (14, 4), 3>
5. <10, 0, 8, (2, 10), 10>
6. <10, 4, 9, (14, 10), 10>
7. <2, 1, 13, (5, 2), 2>
8. <2, 11, 5, (3, 2), 2>
9. <2, 8, 6, (0, 2), 2>
10. <4, 7, 12, (9, 4), 4>
11. <13, 14, 0, (4, 13), 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
