Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 20) (1, 10) (1, 23) (1, 7) (21, 16) (21, 15) (2, 3) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 14) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 11) (12, 23) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 19) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 26) (16, 21) (16, 22) (16, 23) (17, 8) (17, 25) (17, 24) (25, 9) (25, 29) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 28) (19, 27) (19, 25) (19, 22) (19, 20) (22, 16) (22, 19) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 28) (26, 29) (26, 0) (26, 3) (6, 23) (20, 9) (20, 12) (20, 19) (14, 29) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 15) (18, 14) (24, 4) (24, 17) (24, 14) (3, 2) (3, 27) (3, 4) (3, 26) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 15) (13, 10) (13, 11) (23, 1) (23, 12) (23, 16) (23, 6) (28, 25) (28, 10) (15, 21) (15, 14) (15, 11) (7, 1) (7, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 25, 29, 26, 0, 8, 17, 24, 4, 14, 29, 25)
- Cycle 2: (8, 17, 25, 19, 27, 12, 23, 16, 15)
- Cycle 3: (15, 16, 22, 19, 20, 9, 25, 17, 24, 14)
- Cycle 4: (22, 19, 27, 7, 1, 10, 28, 25, 29)
- Cycle 5: (10, 28, 25, 29, 14, 4, 3, 26, 0, 8)
- Cycle 6: (3, 4, 8, 17, 25, 29, 14, 24, 17)
- Cycle 7: (14, 24, 17, 25, 19, 20, 12, 27, 3)
- Cycle 8: (1, 7, 27, 19, 22, 16, 23, 12)
- Cycle 9: (23, 12, 27, 19, 25, 17, 8, 0)
- Cycle 10: (7, 27, 12, 23, 16, 21, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 25, 29, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <25, 27, 23, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <16, 22, 19, 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <19, 27, 7, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <25, 29, 14, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <17, 25, 19, 24>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <25, 27, 12, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <12, 23, 27, 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <27, 7, 1, 23>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <27, 19, 22, 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, so the final count is [10].
