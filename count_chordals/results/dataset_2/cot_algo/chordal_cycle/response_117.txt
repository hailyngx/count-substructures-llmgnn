Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <12, (6, 14), 1, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <12, (6, 14), 3, 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 58 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count is [58].
