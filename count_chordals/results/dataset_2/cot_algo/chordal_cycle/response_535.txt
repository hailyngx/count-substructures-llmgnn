Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 7, 5)
2. Cycle 2: (5, 9, 1, 2, 5)
3. Cycle 3: (5, 9, 0, 4, 5)
4. Cycle 4: (5, 8, 3, 6, 5)
5. Cycle 5: (5, 8, 0, 4, 5)
6. Cycle 6: (5, 4, 0, 8, 5)
7. Cycle 7: (9, 3, 7, 2, 9)
8. Cycle 8: (9, 1, 2, 7, 9)
9. Cycle 9: (9, 0, 4, 1, 9)
10. Cycle 10: (4, 0, 8, 3, 4)
11. Cycle 11: (7, 3, 6, 2, 7)
12. Cycle 12: (6, 3, 8, 5, 6)
13. Cycle 13: (8, 3, 6, 2, 8)
14. Cycle 14: (2, 1, 9, 5, 2)
15. Cycle 15: (0, 9, 5, 8, 0)
16. Cycle 16: (1, 9, 5, 4, 1)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 1 with chord (3, 7) is chordal: <1, (3, 7), 5>
2. Cycle 4 with chord (6, 3) is chordal: <2, (6, 3), 5>
3. Cycle 5 with chord (0, 8) is chordal: <3, (0, 8), 5>
4. Cycle 8 with chord (2, 7) is chordal: <4, (2, 7), 9>
5. Cycle 10 with chord (0, 8) is chordal: <5, (0, 8), 4>
6. Cycle 15 with chord (5, 8) is chordal: <6, (5, 8), 9>
7. Cycle 16 with chord (5, 4) is chordal: <7, (5, 4), 9>

Step 3:
The total number of chordal 4-cycles found is [7].
