Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 29) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 24) (6, 18) (6, 20) (9, 24) (9, 10) (7, 21) (7, 3) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 12) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 25) (0, 21) (0, 10) (0, 5) (20, 6) (20, 2) (20, 11) (1, 26) (1, 27) (1, 8) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 14) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 15) (29, 13) (29, 19) (29, 24) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (12, 21) (12, 4) (3, 7) (3, 26) (3, 4) (3, 27) (19, 29) (19, 27) (14, 26) (14, 28) (11, 20) (11, 4) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 18) (25, 23) (25, 16) (15, 23) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 24) (15, 2) (17, 23) (17, 28) (27, 1) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 16) (2, 13) (2, 20) (2, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 15) (16, 8) (16, 25) (16, 27) (24, 22) (24, 9) (24, 29) (24, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 

There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle <13, 22, 23, 15, 5> with edges (13, 22), (22, 23), (23, 15), (15, 5), (5, 13)
2. Cycle <13, 22, 24, 9, 10> with edges (13, 22), (22, 24), (24, 9), (9, 10), (10, 13)
3. Cycle <13, 22, 23, 17, 28, 26, 3, 4> with edges (13, 22), (22, 23), (23, 17), (17, 28), (28, 26), (26, 3), (3, 4), (4, 13)
4. Cycle <13, 5, 15, 23, 17, 28, 26, 1> with edges (13, 5), (5, 15), (15, 23), (23, 17), (17, 28), (28, 26), (26, 1), (1, 13)
5. Cycle <13, 5, 15, 23, 17, 28, 14, 26> with edges (13, 5), (5, 15), (15, 23), (23, 17), (17, 28), (28, 14), (14, 26), (26, 13)
6. Cycle <13, 29, 24, 22, 23, 17, 28, 26> with edges (13, 29), (29, 24), (24, 22), (22, 23), (23, 17), (17, 28), (28, 26), (26, 13)
7. Cycle <13, 29, 24, 15, 5, 0, 21, 12, 4> with edges (13, 29), (29, 24), (24, 15), (15, 5), (5, 0), (0, 21), (21, 12), (12, 4), (4, 13)
8. Cycle <13, 29, 19, 27, 1, 8, 18, 6, 20> with edges (13, 29), (29, 19), (19, 27), (27, 1), (1, 8), (8, 18), (18, 6), (6, 20), (20, 13)
9. Cycle <22, 13, 29, 24, 22> with edges (22, 13), (13, 29), (29, 24), (24, 22)

Step 2: 

Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycle is <13, 22, 23, 17, 28, 26, 3, 4> with the chord being edge (17, 28).

Step 3:

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [8].
