Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (11, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 10) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 8, 0, 7, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 6, 5, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 9, 3, 0, 4)
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 1, 14, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 12, 13, 2, 5)
- Cycle 6: (12, 14, 1, 6, 12)
- Cycle 7: (2, 6, 3, 9, 2)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (0, 4)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (6, 4)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (13, 5)
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (14, 12)
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: (3, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

List of unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, 4, 8, (0, 4), 7>
- <2, 4, 8, (6, 4), 5>
- <3, 4, 9, (9, 4), 3>
- <4, 5, 6, (1, 5), 4>
- <5, 5, 12, (13, 5), 2>
- <6, 12, 14, (14, 12), 1>
- <7, 2, 6, (3, 6), 9>
