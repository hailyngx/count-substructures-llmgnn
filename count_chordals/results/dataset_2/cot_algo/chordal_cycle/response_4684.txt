Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 12) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 26) (2, 16) (2, 21) (29, 28) (29, 25) (29, 22) (18, 27) (18, 14) (22, 29) (22, 6) (22, 21) (10, 11) (10, 25) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (23, 8) (23, 24) (5, 24) (5, 21) (6, 22) (6, 17) (6, 26) (28, 29) (28, 9) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 7) (19, 8) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 9) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 0) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (20, 27) (20, 9) (20, 3) (20, 26) (26, 27) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 12) (1, 13) (1, 25) (25, 29) (25, 10) (25, 1) (25, 0) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 4) (24, 23) (24, 5) (24, 0) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 0) (21, 2) (21, 22) (21, 5) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 26) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles in the given graph. 
One of the cycles is <0, 15, 7, 16>. Another is <3, 17, 6, 22>. 

Step 2:
Checking for exact one chord in each cycle:
For cycle <0, 15, 7, 16>, adding chord (5, 21) creates a chordal 4-cycle <0, 15, (5, 21), 7, 16>.
For cycle <3, 17, 6, 22>, adding chord (14, 20) creates a chordal 4-cycle <3, 17, (14, 20), 6, 22>.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 0.

Therefore, the final count is [2].
