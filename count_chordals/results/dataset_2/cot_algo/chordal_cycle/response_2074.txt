Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 6-9-4-7-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-8-7-6
- Cycle 3: 6-8-5-2-6
- Cycle 4: 9-4-7-8-9
- Cycle 5: 9-8-5-2-9
- Cycle 6: 4-7-8-5-4
- Cycle 7: 7-8-5-2-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1: 6-9-4-7-6 has chord <6, 4>
- Cycle 2: 6-9-8-7-6 has chord <6, 8>
- Cycle 3: 6-8-5-2-6 has chord <6, 5>
- Cycle 4: 9-4-7-8-9 has chord <9, 7>
- Cycle 5: 9-8-5-2-9 has chord <9, 5>
- Cycle 6: 4-7-8-5-4 has chord <4, 8>
- Cycle 7: 7-8-5-2-7 has chord <7, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
- <6, 4, 9, 7>
- <6, 8, 9, 7>
- <6, 5, 8, 7>
- <9, 7, 4, 8>
- <9, 5, 8, 2>
- <4, 8, 7, 5>
- <7, 5, 8, 2>
