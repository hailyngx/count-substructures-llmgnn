Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-4-6-5
- Cycle 3: 5-3-1-9-5
- Cycle 4: 5-7-6-4-5
- Cycle 5: 1-4-6-9-1
- Cycle 6: 1-3-0-9-1
- Cycle 7: 1-2-8-9-1
- Cycle 8: 1-8-6-4-5-1
- Cycle 9: 3-5-7-6-4-3
- Cycle 10: 0-3-5-4-1-0

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <1, (5, 9), 6, (4, 5)> with chord (5, 9)
- <1, (6, 9), 4, (5, 6)> with chord (6, 9)
- <1, (5, 9), 3, (1, 9)> with chord (1, 9)
- <1, (6, 4), 9, (5, 6)> with chord (6, 4)
- <1, (9, 5), 4, (6, 5)> with chord (9, 5)
- <1, (8, 2), 9, (1, 8)> with chord (8, 2)

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [6].
