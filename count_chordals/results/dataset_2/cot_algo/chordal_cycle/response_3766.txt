Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <4, 11, 14, 15> (Chord: (4, 15))
- <6, 12, 24, 14> (Chord: (12, 24))
- <11, 14, 24, 12> (Chord: (14, 24))
- <15, 14, 11, 22> (Chord: (14, 11))
- <21, 13, 1, 29> (Chord: (13, 1))
- <22, 11, 4, 27> (Chord: (11, 4))
- <24, 14, 11, 18> (Chord: (14, 11))
- <29, 2, 6, 12> (Chord: (2, 6))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
