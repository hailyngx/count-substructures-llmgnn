Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 12) (20, 5) (20, 3) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 4) (28, 29) (28, 27) (28, 23) (29, 28) (29, 21) (6, 21) (6, 1) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 23) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 26) (3, 22) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 15) (7, 0) (7, 22) (7, 13) (21, 29) (21, 6) (21, 16) (21, 23) (21, 22) (18, 17) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 8) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 17) (27, 1) (16, 25) (16, 21) (16, 8) (1, 6) (1, 27) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 19) (4, 25) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (8, 11) (8, 26) (8, 16) (2, 26) (2, 13) (2, 24) (2, 17) (15, 11) (15, 24) (19, 1) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 15) (10, 1) (10, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 2) (17, 18) (17, 27) (17, 2) (17, 23) (17, 22) (23, 28) (23, 14) (23, 21) (23, 17) (22, 3) (22, 7) (22, 21) (22, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1-6-21-29-28-27-25-16-21
- Cycle 2: 2-26-3-20-5-14-23-28-27-1-4-25
- Cycle 3: 3-11-15-24-2-26
- Cycle 4: 4-1-6-21-29-28-27-25

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 25, 4, 21>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- Number of chordless 4-cycles: [3]
