Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (12, 6) (12, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. (0, 7, 1, 8, 0)
2. (0, 10, 5, 14, 0)
3. (0, 13, 2, 14, 0)
4. (1, 4, 14, 5, 1)
5. (1, 7, 0, 10, 1)
6. (1, 8, 5, 14, 1)
7. (2, 6, 12, 3, 13, 2)
8. (2, 7, 0, 10, 1, 8, 14, 5, 2)
9. (2, 13, 3, 12, 6, 2)
10. (3, 9, 2, 13, 11, 3)
11. (3, 10, 1, 8, 5, 14, 2, 13, 3)
12. (3, 11, 10, 0, 13, 3)
13. (3, 12, 6, 2, 13, 3)
14. (3, 13, 2, 14, 5, 8, 1, 10, 0, 13)
15. (4, 1, 7, 2, 14, 5, 4)
16. (4, 14, 5, 8, 1, 7, 0, 10, 11, 4)
17. (5, 1, 8, 14, 2, 7, 1, 5)
18. (5, 8, 1, 7, 0, 10, 11, 13, 2, 14, 5)
19. (5, 10, 0, 13, 2, 7, 8, 14, 5)
20. (5, 14, 2, 13, 3, 12, 6, 4)

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 7, 1, 8, 0, (10, 5)>
2. <0, 13, 2, 14, 0, (10, 5)>
3. <1, 4, 14, 5, 1, (7, 10)>
4. <2, 6, 12, 3, 13, 2, (14, 5)>
5. <3, 9, 2, 13, 11, 3, (10, 0)>
6. <3, 11, 10, 0, 13, 3, (8, 5)>
7. <4, 1, 7, 2, 14, 5, (8, 10)>
8. <5, 1, 8, 14, 2, 7, 1, (4, 10)>
9. <5, 8, 1, 7, 0, 10, 11, 13, 2, 14, 5, (11, 3)>
10. <5, 14, 2, 13, 3, 12, 6, 4, (8, 7)>

Step 3:
There are a total of [10] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
