Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 9, 2, 3, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 9, 13, 10, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 13, 0, 2, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 8, 7, 0, 2, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 8, 7, 11, 12, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (8, 7)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (8, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Only one chordless 4-cycle was found. 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle is <5, 9, 2, 3>.
