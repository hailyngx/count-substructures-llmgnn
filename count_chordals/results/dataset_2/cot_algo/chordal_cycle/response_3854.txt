Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <5, 9, 10, 1, 7>
- <5, 9, 13, 2, 11>
- <5, 4, 3, 11, 2>
- <5, 4, 7, 1, 10>
- <5, 7, 1, 10, 0>
- <5, 6, 9, 14, 3>
- <9, 10, 1, 7, 5>
- <9, 13, 2, 11, 3>
- <9, 6, 5, 7, 1>
- <9, 14, 3, 11, 2>
- <6, 5, 7, 1, 10>
- <6, 9, 14, 3, 11>
- <1, 10, 9, 5, 4>
- <1, 7, 5, 4, 3>
- <3, 11, 2, 13, 9>
- <10, 1, 7, 5, 4>
- <10, 9, 5, 4, 7>
- <10, 8, 6, 5, 4>
- <11, 3, 4, 5, 7>
- <5, 7, 4, 3, 11>
- <5, 6, 8, 3, 11>
- <7, 5, 6, 8, 3>
- <7, 1, 10, 8, 4>
- <8, 6, 9, 5, 7>
- <8, 3, 4, 5, 6>
- <2, 11, 3, 4, 7>
- <2, 13, 9, 5, 4>
- <11, 3, 8, 6, 5>
- <4, 5, 9, 13, 2>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 9, 10, 1> with chord (5, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 4, 3, 11> with chord (4, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 7, 1, 10> with chord (7, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 13, 2, 11> with chord (13, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 6, 5, 7> with chord (6, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 9, 14, 3> with chord (9, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 11, 2, 13> with chord (11, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <8, 6, 9, 5> with chord (6, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 11, 3, 4> with chord (11, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 19 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
