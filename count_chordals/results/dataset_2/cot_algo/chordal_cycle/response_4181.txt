Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 23) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 2) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 20) (25, 15) (25, 0) (25, 24) (0, 25) (0, 1) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 26) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 4) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 27) (26, 12) (9, 24) (9, 7) (22, 28) (22, 12) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 5) (10, 18) (15, 25) (15, 7) (27, 26) (27, 21) (4, 19) (4, 28) (4, 21) (12, 20) (12, 26) (12, 22) (12, 5) (28, 22) (28, 4) (23, 14) (23, 26) (23, 29) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 6) (6, 14) (6, 7) (21, 8) (21, 27) (21, 4) (29, 11) (29, 23) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 9) (24, 1) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are many cycles in the graph, but we will focus on cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 3, 5, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 16, 18, 10, 11)
- Cycle 3: (11, 3, 5, 13, 11)
- Cycle 4: (16, 18, 10, 11, 16)
- Cycle 5: (16, 3, 5, 13, 16)
- Cycle 6: (16, 18, 10, 18, 16)
- Cycle 7: (14, 17, 2, 19, 14)
- Cycle 8: (14, 23, 26, 12, 14)
- Cycle 9: (14, 13, 5, 3, 14)
- Cycle 10: (17, 24, 25, 0, 17)
- Cycle 11: (17, 2, 8, 21, 17)
- Cycle 12: (20, 25, 24, 17, 20)
- Cycle 13: (25, 20, 12, 22, 25)
- Cycle 14: (25, 15, 7, 11, 25)
- Cycle 15: (0, 25, 20, 12, 0)
- Cycle 16: (2, 17, 24, 9, 2)
- Cycle 17: (2, 8, 21, 27, 2)
- Cycle 18: (18, 16, 3, 5, 18)
- Cycle 19: (8, 2, 17, 14, 8)
- Cycle 20: (8, 21, 27, 26, 8)
- Cycle 21: (19, 26, 23, 14, 19)
- Cycle 22: (26, 12, 20, 25, 26)
- Cycle 23: (9, 24, 25, 20, 9)
- Cycle 24: (22, 12, 26, 23, 22)
- Cycle 25: (5, 8, 2, 17, 5)
- Cycle 26: (5, 13, 14, 23, 5)
- Cycle 27: (13, 5, 3, 11, 13)
- Cycle 28: (3, 5, 13, 1, 3)
- Cycle 29: (10, 18, 16, 11, 10)
- Cycle 30: (15, 7, 11, 16, 15)
  
Step 2: 
Identifying the chordal 4-cycles:
- Cycle 10: (17, 24, 25, 0, 17) has the chord (24, 25).
- Cycle 30: (15, 7, 11, 16, 15) has the chord (7, 16).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have identified 2 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is **[2]**.

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <17, 24, 25, 0>
2. <15, 7, 11, 16>
