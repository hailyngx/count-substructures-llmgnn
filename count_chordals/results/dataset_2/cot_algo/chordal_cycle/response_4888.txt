- Cycle 33: (13, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle 34: (15, 8, 18, 19)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 2: (0, 12, 19, 18) has exactly one chord: (12, 18).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
  Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <2, (12, 18), 0, 19>
