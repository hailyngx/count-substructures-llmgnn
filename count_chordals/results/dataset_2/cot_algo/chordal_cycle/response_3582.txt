Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 8) (3, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <5, 6, 11, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 2, 11, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 11, 12, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 10, 12, 5>
- Cycle 5: <6, 5, 11, 6>
- Cycle 6: <6, 11, 12, 6>
- Cycle 7: <6, 5, 10, 6>
- Cycle 8: <12, 7, 2, 12>
- Cycle 9: <12, 11, 2, 12>
- Cycle 10: <12, 0, 4, 12>
- Cycle 11: <12, 8, 5, 12>
- Cycle 12: <2, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle 13: <2, 1, 4, 2>
- Cycle 14: <2, 11, 1, 2>
- Cycle 15: <0, 12, 7, 0>
- Cycle 16: <0, 8, 12, 0>
- Cycle 17: <0, 10, 12, 0>
- Cycle 18: <10, 0, 12, 10>
- Cycle 19: <10, 3, 14, 10>
- Cycle 20: <10, 1, 14, 10>
- Cycle 21: <10, 5, 12, 10>
- Cycle 22: <1, 9, 4, 1>
- Cycle 23: <1, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 24: <1, 2, 7, 1>
- Cycle 25: <1, 11, 2, 1>
- Cycle 26: <1, 14, 10, 1>
- Cycle 27: <11, 6, 5, 11>
- Cycle 28: <11, 12, 0, 11>
- Cycle 29: <11, 2, 1, 11>
- Cycle 30: <11, 1, 9, 11>
- Cycle 31: <11, 13, 6, 11>
- Cycle 32: <7, 12, 0, 7>
- Cycle 33: <7, 2, 1, 7>
- Cycle 34: <7, 4, 0, 7>
- Cycle 35: <7, 1, 2, 7>
- Cycle 36: <8, 5, 12, 8>
- Cycle 37: <8, 6, 5, 8>
- Cycle 38: <8, 0, 12, 8>
- Cycle 39: <8, 14, 10, 8>
- Cycle 40: <14, 1, 10, 14>
- Cycle 41: <14, 8, 0, 14>
- Cycle 42: <3, 10, 14, 3>
- Cycle 43: <13, 11, 6, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 27: <11, 6, 5, 11> with the chord (11, 13).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]
