Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle <1, 2, 5, 4> with edges (1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), (2, 1)
2. Cycle <1, 2, 7, 5> with edges (1, 2), (2, 7), (7, 5), (5, 1)
3. Cycle <1, 4, 5, 7> with edges (1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 7), (7, 1)
4. Cycle <1, 5, 7, 2> with edges (1, 5), (5, 7), (7, 2), (2, 1)
5. Cycle <0, 3, 5, 7> with edges (0, 3), (3, 5), (5, 7), (7, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <1, 2, 5, 4> is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (2, 4)
- <1, 2, 7, 5> is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (2, 5)
- <1, 4, 5, 7> is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (4, 7)
- <0, 3, 5, 7> is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (3, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
