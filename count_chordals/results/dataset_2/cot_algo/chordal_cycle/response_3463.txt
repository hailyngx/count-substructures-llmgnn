Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 29) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 23) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (18, 5) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 20) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 16) (22, 21) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 24) (0, 15) (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 17) (20, 18) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 25) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 20) (13, 17) (26, 18) (21, 22) (11, 22) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 17) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 29) (17, 27) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 11) (14, 20) (14, 28) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 24) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 16) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 28) (19, 29) (29, 5) (29, 23) (29, 19) (24, 3) (24, 15) (24, 28) (16, 22) (16, 1) (10, 27) (25, 8) (25, 4) (4, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-1-5
- Cycle 2: 18-22-16-1-18
- Cycle 3: 18-22-11-8-18
- Cycle 4: 18-20-15-3-18
...

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 9, 6, 1, (5, 1)>
- <18, 22, 16, 1, (18, 16)>
- <18, 22, 11, 8, (18, 11)>
- <18, 20, 15, 3, (18, 15)>
...

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [3] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
