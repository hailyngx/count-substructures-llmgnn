Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (19, 16) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 1) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 11) (2, 11) (2, 1) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 6) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 6) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 8-13-4-6-8
- Cycle 2: 10-8-13-17-10
- Cycle 3: 17-13-4-6-17
- Cycle 4: 5-17-13-9-5
- Cycle 5: 14-5-17-10-14
- Cycle 6: 18-14-11-2-18
- Cycle 7: 3-4-13-17-3
- Cycle 8: 11-3-7-0-11
- Cycle 9: 6-4-13-17-6

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycle is:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <8, (13, 4), 6>

Step 3:
So, the total number of chordless cycles found is [1].
