Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 14) (8, 11) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 18) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 17) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 13) (18, 11) (18, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 14) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 7) (4, 10) (4, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 0-1-7-9-11-0
        - Cycle 2: 2-5-3-11-8-2
        - Cycle 3: 4-10-2-5-19-4
        - Cycle 4: 7-9-11-8-14-7
        - Cycle 5: 12-13-14-8-11-12
        - Cycle 6: 13-17-15-12-13
        - Cycle 7: 15-19-5-3-17-15
        - Cycle 8: 16-4-10-2-5-16
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Checking Cycle 1: 0-1-(9)-11-0 [Chord: (9)]
        - Checking Cycle 2: 2-5-(3)-11-8-2 [Chord: (3)]
        - Checking Cycle 3: 4-10-(2)-5-19-4 [Chord: (2)]
        - Checking Cycle 4: 7-9-(11)-8-14-7 [Chord: (11)]
        - Checking Cycle 5: 12-13-(14)-8-11-12 [Chord: (14)]
        - Checking Cycle 6: 13-17-(15)-12-13 [Chord: (15)]
        - Checking Cycle 7: 15-19-(5)-3-17-15 [Chord: (5)]
        - Checking Cycle 8: 16-4-(10)-2-5-16 [Chord: (10)]
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, (9), 11>
        - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <2, (3), 11>
        - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <4, (2), 5>
        - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <7, (11), 9>
        - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <12, (14), 13>
        - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <13, (15), 17>
        - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <15, (5), 19>
        - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <16, (10), 4>
        
Putting the final count in brackets, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
