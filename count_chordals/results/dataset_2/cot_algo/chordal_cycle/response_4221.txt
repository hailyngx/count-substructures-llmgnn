Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 1 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 7 - 3 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 0 - 4 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 6 - 2 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 1 - 4 - 0 - 9
- Cycle 7: 9 - 8 - 0 - 7 - 9
- Cycle 8: 6 - 2 - 3 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 9: 1 - 4 - 0 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 10: 3 - 7 - 0 - 8 - 3

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 2 - 5 (Chord: 6-2)
- Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 1 - 9 - 5 (Chord: 4-1)
- Cycle 3: 5 - 7 - 3 - 1 - 5 (Chord: 7-3)
- Cycle 4: 5 - 0 - 4 - 1 - 5 (Chord: 0-4)
- Cycle 5: 9 - 6 - 2 - 3 - 9 (Chord: 6-3)
- Cycle 6: 9 - 1 - 4 - 0 - 9 (Chord: 1-4)
- Cycle 7: 9 - 8 - 0 - 7 - 9 (Chord: 8-7)
- Cycle 8: 6 - 2 - 3 - 7 - 6 (Chord: 2-7)
- Cycle 9: 1 - 4 - 0 - 8 - 1 (Chord: 4-8)
- Cycle 10: 3 - 7 - 0 - 8 - 3 (Chord: 7-8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [10]. 

The list of unique chordal 4-cycles is as follows:
<5, (6, 2), 9)>
<5, (4, 1), 9)>
<5, (7, 3), 1)>
<5, (0, 4), 1)>
<9, (6, 3), 2)>
<9, (1, 4), 0)>
<9, (8, 7), 0)>
<6, (2, 7), 3)>
<1, (4, 8), 0)>
<3, (7, 8), 0)>
