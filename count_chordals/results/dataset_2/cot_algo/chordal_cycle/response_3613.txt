Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 7) (1, 11) (1, 16) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 19) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 5) (8, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (13, 4) (13, 2) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 12) (0, 18) (0, 19) (16, 1) (16, 12) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 18) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 7) (2, 13) (2, 9) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 9)

- Cycle 13: 11 - 1 - 16 - 12 - 11
- Cycle 14: 11 - 3 - 19 - 0 - 11
- Cycle 15: 11 - 19 - 3 - 12 - 11
- Cycle 16: 4 - 15 - 10 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 17: 4 - 13 - 2 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 18: 4 - 9 - 7 - 17 - 4
- Cycle 19: 8 - 5 - 12 - 16 - 8
- Cycle 20: 8 - 18 - 0 - 19 - 8
- Cycle 21: 8 - 5 - 18 - 12 - 8
- Cycle 22: 5 - 12 - 16 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 23: 5 - 18 - 0 - 19 - 5
- Cycle 24: 5 - 12 - 3 - 11 - 5
- Cycle 25: 13 - 4 - 15 - 9 - 13
- Cycle 26: 13 - 2 - 9 - 7 - 13
- Cycle 27: 13 - 4 - 15 - 12 - 13
- Cycle 28: 15 - 10 - 17 - 14 - 15
- Cycle 29: 15 - 4 - 13 - 2 - 15
- Cycle 30: 15 - 9 - 7 - 17 - 15
- Cycle 31: 15 - 12 - 5 - 18 - 15
- Cycle 32: 0 - 18 - 8 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 33: 0 - 19 - 3 - 11 - 0
- Cycle 34: 0 - 19 - 18 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 35: 16 - 1 - 11 - 3 - 16
- Cycle 36: 16 - 12 - 5 - 8 - 16
- Cycle 37: 18 - 8 - 5 - 12 - 18
- Cycle 38: 18 - 19 - 0 - 8 - 18
- Cycle 39: 18 - 5 - 12 - 3 - 18
- Cycle 40: 18 - 19 - 0 - 18

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The chordal 4-cycle with a chord is <14, (10, 6), 17)>
- The chordal 4-cycle with a chord is <17, (15, 10), 4)>
- The chordal 4-cycle with a chord is <1, (16, 12), 5)>
- The chordal 4-cycle with a chord is <3, (19, 0), 11)>
- The chordal 4-cycle with a chord is <10, (7, 9), 17)>
- The chordal 4-cycle with a chord is <6, (14, 17), 10)>
- The chordal 4-cycle with a chord is <4, (13, 2), 9)>
- The chordal 4-cycle with a chord is <8, (18, 5), 12)>
- The chordal 4-cycle with a chord is <5, (12, 16), 8)>
- The chordal 4-cycle with a chord is <0, (19, 18), 8)>
- The chordal 4-cycle with a chord is <16, (3, 11), 0)>
- The chordal 4-cycle with a chord is <18, (19, 0), 8)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is [11].
