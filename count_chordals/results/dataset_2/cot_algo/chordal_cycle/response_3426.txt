Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 6
        - Cycle 2: 6 - 9 - 1 - 2 - 6
        - Cycle 3: 6 - 9 - 0 - 3 - 6
        - Cycle 4: 6 - 7 - 2 - 5 - 6
        - Cycle 5: 6 - 7 - 4 - 3 - 6
        - Cycle 6: 6 - 5 - 2 - 8 - 6
        - Cycle 7: 9 - 4 - 7 - 2 - 9
        - Cycle 8: 9 - 0 - 3 - 8 - 9
        - Cycle 9: 4 - 7 - 2 - 5 - 4
        - Cycle 10: 7 - 2 - 5 - 8 - 7
        - Cycle 11: 5 - 2 - 1 - 6 - 5
        - Cycle 12: 5 - 8 - 3 - 0 - 5
        - Cycle 13: 2 - 1 - 9 - 4 - 2
        - Cycle 14: 2 - 8 - 3 - 4 - 2
        - Cycle 15: 2 - 1 - 0 - 9 - 2
        - Cycle 16: 8 - 3 - 4 - 7 - 8
        - Cycle 17: 8 - 3 - 0 - 1 - 8
        - Cycle 18: 1 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 1
        - Cycle 19: 1 - 0 - 3 - 8 - 1
        - Cycle 20: 3 - 4 - 7 - 2 - 3
        - Cycle 21: 3 - 8 - 1 - 6 - 3
        - Cycle 22: 0 - 3 - 4 - 9 - 0

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <6, 9, 4, (7, 6)> (Chord: 7-6)
        - <6, 9, 1, (2, 6)> (Chord: 2-6)
        - <6, 9, 0, (3, 6)> (Chord: 3-6)
        - <6, 7, 2, (5, 6)> (Chord: 5-6)
        - <6, 7, 4, (3, 6)> (Chord: 3-6)
        - <6, 5, 2, (8, 6)> (Chord: 8-6)
        - <9, 4, 7, (2, 9)> (Chord: 2-9)
        - <9, 0, 3, (8, 9)> (Chord: 8-9)
        - <4, 7, 2, (5, 4)> (Chord: 5-4)
        - <7, 2, 5, (8, 7)> (Chord: 8-7)
        - <5, 2, 1, (6, 5)> (Chord: 6-5)
        - <5, 8, 3, (0, 5)> (Chord: 0-5)
        - <2, 1, 9, (4, 2)> (Chord: 4-2)
        - <2, 8, 3, (4, 2)> (Chord: 4-2)
        - <2, 1, 0, (9, 2)> (Chord: 9-2)
        - <8, 3, 4, (7, 8)> (Chord: 7-8)
        - <8, 3, 0, (1, 8)> (Chord: 1-8)
        - <1, 9, 4, (7, 1)> (Chord: 7-1)
        - <1, 0, 3, (8, 1)> (Chord: 8-1)
        - <3, 4, 7, (2, 3)> (Chord: 2-3)
        - <3, 8, 1, (6, 3)> (Chord: 6-3)
        - <0, 3, 4, (9, 0)> (Chord: 9-0)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 22 unique chordal 4-cycles found. 
        So, the final count of chordless cycles is [22].
