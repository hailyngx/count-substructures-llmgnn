Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5-4-6-7-5
- Cycle 2: 5-4-12-6-5
- Cycle 3: 5-3-1-10-5
- Cycle 4: 5-3-1-13-5
- Cycle 5: 5-4-13-0-5
- Cycle 6: 5-3-12-6-5
- Cycle 7: 5-3-12-2-5
- Cycle 8: 4-7-8-0-4
- Cycle 9: 4-7-6-12-4
- Cycle 10: 4-7-6-9-4
- Cycle 11: 4-7-6-12-3-5-4
- Cycle 12: 4-12-3-2-8-4
- Cycle 13: 1-10-2-12-4-13-1
- Cycle 14: 1-3-12-2-11-14-1

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (4, 13)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (3, 5)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (3, 5)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (7, 12)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (7, 4)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 13 has one chord: (2, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 3, (1, 5)>
<5, 4, 12, 6, (4, 6)>
<5, 3, 12, 6, (3, 5)>
<5, 4, 13, 0, (4, 13)>
<4, 7, 8, 0, (7, 12)>
<4, 7, 6, 12, (7, 4)>
<4, 12, 3, 2, 8, (4, 8)>
<1, 10, 2, 12, 4, 13, (7, 12)>
<1, 3, 12, 2, 11, 14, (2, 4)>
