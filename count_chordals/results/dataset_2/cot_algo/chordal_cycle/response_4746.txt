Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
I will start by listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: 0-5-6-1-0
- Cycle 2: 1-3-4-7-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-5-8-1
- Cycle 4: 2-4-3-1-2
- Cycle 5: 4-7-9-8-4
- Cycle 6: 5-7-4-3-5
- Cycle 7: 6-8-5-0-6
- Cycle 8: 7-9-1-6-7
- Cycle 9: 8-5-6-0-8
- Cycle 10: 9-3-4-7-9

Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has two chords: (3, 7), (4, 1).
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (5, 8).
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (3, 1).
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (7, 8).
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (4, 5).
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (5, 8).
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (1, 6).
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (5, 6).
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (4, 7).

Finally, we count the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is 9, and represent it as [9]. The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:

- <2, (3, 7)>
- <3, (5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 1)>
- <5, (7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5)>
- <7, (5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6)>
- <9, (5, 6)>
- <10, (4, 7)>
