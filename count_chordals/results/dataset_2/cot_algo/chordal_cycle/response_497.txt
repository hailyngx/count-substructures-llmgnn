Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-4-3-5
- Cycle 2: 9-6-2-8-9
- Cycle 3: 9-4-7-8-9
- Cycle 4: 1-5-3-2-1
- Cycle 5: 1-4-7-8-1
- Cycle 6: 1-3-7-8-1
- Cycle 7: 1-3-4-7-1
- Cycle 8: 3-5-1-4-3
- Cycle 9: 3-7-8-1-3
- Cycle 10: 0-5-3-2-0
- Cycle 11: 0-9-6-2-0

Step 2:
Check for exactly one chord:
- <1, (5, 3), 4>
- <2, (9, 6), 8>
- <3, (7, 8), 4>
- <4, (1, 5), 3>
- <5, (1, 7), 8>
- <6, (1, 7), 3>
- <7, (1, 4), 7>
- <8, (3, 5), 4>
- <9, (3, 7), 1>
- <10, (0, 5), 3>
- <11, (9, 6), 2>

Step 3:
There are a total of 11 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
