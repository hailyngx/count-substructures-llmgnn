Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 0) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 9) (15, 12) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 5) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (16, 2) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 10) (18, 5) (18, 16) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 9) (6, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 11 - 10 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 2: 4 - 11 - 1 - 17 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 3: 7 - 17 - 1 - 11 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 4: 7 - 17 - 0 - 1 - 11 - 10 - 3 - 7
- Cycle 5: 7 - 17 - 0 - 1 - 16 - 2 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 6: 7 - 3 - 10 - 11 - 4 - 7

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chord (10, 4)
- Cycle 2: Chords (17, 11)
- Cycle 3: Chords (1, 4)
- Cycle 4: Chords (1, 7)
- Cycle 5: Chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 6: Chord (10, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles found in this graph, so the final count is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <7, (10, 4), 3, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <7, (1, 4), 17, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <7, (1, 7), 17, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <7, (10, 7), 3, 11>
