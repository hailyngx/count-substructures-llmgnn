Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- 4-cycle: (4, 0, 8, 2, 4)
- 4-cycle: (4, 0, 1, 2, 4)
- 4-cycle: (4, 6, 7, 8, 4)
- 4-cycle: (4, 6, 5, 0, 4)
- 4-cycle: (7, 6, 5, 0, 7)
- 4-cycle: (7, 6, 4, 8, 7)
- 4-cycle: (7, 8, 9, 2, 7)
- 4-cycle: (8, 9, 2, 1, 8)
- 4-cycle: (8, 9, 7, 6, 8)
- 4-cycle: (4, 7, 9, 8, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (4, 2), 6>
- <2, (4, 1), 6>
- <3, (7, 6), 8>
- <4, (7, 8), 9>
- <5, (9, 2), 7>
- <6, (9, 8), 7>
- <7, (4, 9), 8>
- <8, (1, 2), 9>
- <9, (6, 7), 8>
- <10, (4, 9), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0].
