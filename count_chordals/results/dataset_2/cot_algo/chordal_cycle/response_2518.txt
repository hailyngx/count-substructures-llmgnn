Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-8-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-8-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-8-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-3-8-6-0
- Cycle 5: 1-0-7-6-1
- Cycle 6: 1-0-7-4-1
- Cycle 7: 1-8-4-7-1
- Cycle 8: 1-8-4-2-1
- Cycle 9: 2-8-4-7-2
- Cycle 10: 2-8-4-5-2
- Cycle 11: 2-0-5-7-2
- Cycle 12: 2-6-8-4-2
- Cycle 13: 2-6-8-3-2
- Cycle 14: 2-6-7-0-2
- Cycle 15: 2-6-7-4-2
- Cycle 16: 3-8-4-7-3
- Cycle 17: 3-8-4-5-3
- Cycle 18: 3-0-5-7-3
- Cycle 19: 3-6-8-2-3
- Cycle 20: 3-6-1-0-3
- Cycle 21: 4-8-1-6-4
- Cycle 22: 4-8-1-0-4
- Cycle 23: 4-7-6-1-4
- Cycle 24: 4-7-6-3-4
- Cycle 25: 4-0-1-8-4
- Cycle 26: 4-0-7-6-4
- Cycle 27: 4-2-5-0-4
- Cycle 28: 5-0-7-2-5
- Cycle 29: 5-4-7-0-5
- Cycle 30: 5-4-8-2-5
- Cycle 31: 6-7-0-1-6
- Cycle 32: 6-7-0-3-6
- Cycle 33: 6-8-2-0-6
- Cycle 34: 6-1-0-3-6
- Cycle 35: 8-2-4-7-8
- Cycle 36: 8-2-4-0-8
- Cycle 37: 8-6-7-4-8
- Cycle 38: 8-6-7-0-8

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 8: 1-8-4-2-1  Chord: (8, 4)
- Cycle 10: 2-8-4-5-2  Chord: (8, 4)
- Cycle 14: 2-6-7-0-2  Chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 21: 4-8-1-6-4  Chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 25: 4-0-1-8-4  Chord: (1, 0)

Step 3:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the count is [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (8, 4), 2, 4>
- <2, (8, 4), 4, 5>
- <2, (7, 6), 0, 6>
- <4, (4, 1), 6, 8>
- <4, (1, 0), 8, 4>
