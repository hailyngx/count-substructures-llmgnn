Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph. We need to identify the chordal 4-cycles among them.

Step 2:
Identifying the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <5, 12, 10, 14>: (5, 10) is a chord.
- <9, 11, 14, 10>: (9, 14) is a chord.
- <4, 8, 1, 2>: (4, 1) is a chord.
- <7, 0, 10, 14>: (7, 10) is a chord.
- <6, 4, 11, 13>: (6, 11) is a chord.

Step 3:
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord is [5].
