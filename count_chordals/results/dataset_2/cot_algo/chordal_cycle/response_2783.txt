Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (9, 5) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 17) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 8) (12, 15) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 7) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 6) (15, 12) (15, 13) (15, 11) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 15) (11, 19) (11, 17) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 11) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (4, 10, 3, 1, 16, 2, 11)
- Cycle 2: (4, 10, 13, 15, 12, 6, 18)
- Cycle 3: (4, 10, 3, 1, 16, 7, 19)
- Cycle 4: (4, 10, 13, 6, 18, 17, 0)
- Cycle 5: (4, 10, 13, 6, 0, 17, 5)
- Cycle 6: (4, 17, 0, 2, 11, 15, 13)
- Cycle 7: (4, 17, 0, 8, 11, 15, 13)
- Cycle 8: (4, 17, 11, 2, 16, 1, 3)
- Cycle 9: (4, 17, 11, 2, 0, 6, 13)
- Cycle 10: (4, 17, 18, 6, 13, 10, 3)
- Cycle 11: (4, 17, 18, 6, 0, 2, 11)
- Cycle 12: (4, 8, 0, 2, 11, 15, 13)
- Cycle 13: (4, 8, 0, 17, 5, 9, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 1: (4, 10, 3, 1, 16, 2, 11) with chord (16, 11).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. As only one cycle has a chord, the number of chordless cycles is [0].

List of unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (16, 11)>
