Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (10, 8) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (8, 10) (8, 17) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (12, 2) (12, 18) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 19) (15, 19) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

(1) Cycle: 5 - 7 - 19 - 15 - 5
(2) Cycle: 1 - 5 - 7 - 19 - 1
(3) Cycle: 1 - 5 - 13 - 4 - 1
(4) Cycle: 1 - 5 - 13 - 19 - 1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

(1) <5, 19, 15, 7> has one chord (5, 15).
(2) <1, 7, 19, 5> has one chord (1, 19).
(3) <1, 13, 4, 5> has one chord (13, 4).
(4) <1, 5, 13, 19> has one chord (5, 13).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0].
