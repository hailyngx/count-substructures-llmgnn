Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 17) (10, 3) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 19) (2, 11) (2, 15) (18, 14) (18, 15) (7, 16) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 15) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 3) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 17) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (14, 18) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (0, 11) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 19) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 17, 5, 3, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 17, 19, 13, 8, 16, 10, 3, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 17)
- Cycle 2 does not have exactly one chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 0 chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
