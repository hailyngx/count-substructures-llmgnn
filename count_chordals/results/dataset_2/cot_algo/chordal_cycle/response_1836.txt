Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 14) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 9, 4, 13, 5)
- (5, 7, 3, 4, 13, 5)
- (5, 7, 11, 14, 2, 6, 0, 12, 8, 1, 10, 6, 3, 4, 13, 5)
- (9, 4, 13, 5, 0, 6, 2, 11, 12, 8, 1, 10, 7, 3, 4, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<5, 9, 4, 13, 5> has a chord (4, 13)
<5, 7, 3, 4, 13, 5> has a chord (7, 13)
<5, 7, 11, 14, 2, 6, 0, 12, 8, 1, 10, 6, 3, 4, 13, 5> does not have exactly one chord.
<9, 4, 13, 5, 0, 6, 2, 11, 12, 8, 1, 10, 7, 3, 4, 9> does not have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [2].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are <5, 9, 4, 13, 5> and <5, 7, 3, 4, 13, 5>.
