Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 9, 0, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 1, 0, 3, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 1, 7, 2, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (9, 4, 6, 0, 9)
        - Cycle 6: (9, 4, 8, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 7: (1, 0, 3, 2, 1)
        - Cycle 8: (1, 0, 6, 2, 1)
        - Cycle 9: (1, 7, 2, 3, 1)
        - Cycle 10: (4, 6, 0, 3, 4)
        - Cycle 11: (4, 8, 7, 2, 4)
        - Cycle 12: (7, 1, 0, 3, 7)
        - Cycle 13: (7, 1, 2, 3, 7)
        - Cycle 14: (7, 2, 6, 0, 7)
        - Cycle 15: (8, 4, 6, 0, 8)
        - Cycle 16: (8, 4, 0, 3, 8)
        - Cycle 17: (2, 6, 0, 3, 2)
        - Cycle 18: (0, 9, 4, 8, 0)
        - Cycle 19: (0, 9, 5, 1, 0)
        - Cycle 20: (0, 6, 2, 3, 0)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1 is chordal with one chord: (4, 6)
        - Cycle 2 is chordal with one chord: (0, 9)
        - Cycle 3 is chordal with one chord: (0, 3)
        - Cycle 4 is chordal with one chord: (7, 2)
        - Cycle 5 is not chordal.
        - Cycle 6 is chordal with one chord: (4, 8)
        - Cycle 7 is chordal with one chord: (0, 3)
        - Cycle 8 is chordal with one chord: (0, 6)
        - Cycle 9 is not chordal.
        - Cycle 10 is chordal with one chord: (6, 0)
        - Cycle 11 is not chordal.
        - Cycle 12 is chordal with one chord: (1, 3)
        - Cycle 13 is chordal with one chord: (1, 3)
        - Cycle 14 is chordal with one chord: (0, 6)
        - Cycle 15 is chordal with one chord: (4, 0)
        - Cycle 16 is chordal with one chord: (4, 0)
        - Cycle 17 is chordal with one chord: (0, 3)
        - Cycle 18 is chordal with one chord: (4, 8)
        - Cycle 19 is chordal with one chord: (1, 5)
        - Cycle 20 is chordal with one chord: (6, 2)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.
        There are 12 chordal cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is represented as [12].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (4, 6), 5>
<2, (0, 9), 5>
<3, (0, 3), 5>
<4, (7, 2), 5>
<6, (4, 8), 6>
<8, (0, 6), 5>
<10, (6, 0), 5>
<12, (1, 3), 7>
<13, (1, 3), 7>
<14, (0, 6), 7>
<15, (4, 0), 8>
<16, (4, 0), 8>
<17, (0, 3), 8>
<18, (4, 8), 9>
<19, (1, 5), 9>
<20, (6, 2), 0>
