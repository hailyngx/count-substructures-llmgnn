Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 5 - 2 - 1 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 8 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 4 - 9 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 2 - 6 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 5: 5 - 1 - 6 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 6: 5 - 3 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 7: 5 - 4 - 9 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 8: 5 - 1 - 6 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 9: 5 - 8 - 4 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 10: 5 - 3 - 8 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 11: 5 - 1 - 6 - 8 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, (1,6), 2> (chord: 1-6)
- <5, (3,8), 4> (chord: 3-8)
- <5, (1,6), 2> (chord: 1-6)
- <5, (1,6), 2> (chord: 1-6)
- <5, (1,6), 2> (chord: 1-6)
- <5, (4,9), 7> (chord: 4-9)
- <5, (1,6), 7> (chord: 1-6)
- <5, (4,9), 8> (chord: 4-9)
- <5, (3,8), 4> (chord: 3-8)
- <5, (1,6), 8> (chord: 1-6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
