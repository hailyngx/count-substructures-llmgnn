Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 6, 8, 2, 9)
- Cycle 3: (6, 5, 2, 8, 6)
- Cycle 4: (1, 9, 3, 0, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 9, 7, 0, 3)
- Cycle 6: (2, 5, 1, 8, 2)
- Cycle 7: (8, 6, 0, 3, 8)
- Cycle 8: (0, 6, 8, 2, 0)
- Cycle 9: (7, 9, 3, 0, 7)
- Cycle 10: (4, 2, 0, 6, 4)

Step 2:
Checking for the presence of chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has the chord (1, 5).
- Cycle 2 has the chord (6, 9).
- Cycle 3 has the chord (2, 6).
- Cycle 4 has the chord (0, 1).
- Cycle 5 has the chord (3, 9).
- Cycle 6 has the chord (1, 2).
- Cycle 7 has the chord (0, 8).
- Cycle 8 has the chord (2, 6).
- Cycle 9 has the chord (3, 7).
- Cycle 10 has the chord (2, 4).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 10 cycles with exactly one chord. Hence, the number of chordless cycles is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <5, 2, 1, 9>
- <9, 6, 8, 2>
- <6, 5, 2, 8>
- <1, 9, 3, 0>
- <3, 9, 7, 0>
- <2, 5, 1, 8>
- <8, 6, 0, 3>
- <0, 6, 8, 2>
- <7, 9, 3, 0>
- <4, 2, 0, 6>
