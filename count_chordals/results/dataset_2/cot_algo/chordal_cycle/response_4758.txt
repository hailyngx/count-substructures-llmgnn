Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-9-4-7-1
- Cycle 2: 1-7-8-6-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-4-9-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-8-4-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-9-4-1
- Cycle 6: 1-8-7-4-1
- Cycle 7: 4-9-6-8-4
- Cycle 8: 4-9-1-7-4
- Cycle 9: 4-7-1-8-4
- Cycle 10: 4-7-5-8-4
- Cycle 11: 4-7-1-9-4
- Cycle 12: 6-9-1-8-6
- Cycle 13: 6-9-4-1-6
- Cycle 14: 6-9-1-4-6
- Cycle 15: 6-1-7-8-6
- Cycle 16: 6-1-4-9-6
- Cycle 17: 6-8-7-1-6
- Cycle 18: 6-8-4-9-6
- Cycle 19: 7-5-8-6-7
- Cycle 20: 7-5-0-6-7
- Cycle 21: 7-5-8-4-7
- Cycle 22: 7-5-0-8-7
- Cycle 23: 7-1-8-6-7
- Cycle 24: 7-1-4-9-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <1, 6, 9, 4> has a chord (1, 4)
- <1, 7, 8, 6> has a chord (1, 8)
- <1, 7, 4, 9> has a chord (1, 9)
- <1, 6, 8, 4> has a chord (1, 8)
- <1, 6, 9, 4> has a chord (1, 9)
- <1, 8, 7, 4> has a chord (1, 4)
- <4, 9, 6, 8> has a chord (4, 8)
- <4, 9, 1, 7> has a chord (4, 7)
- <4, 7, 1, 8> has a chord (4, 8)
- <4, 7, 5, 8> has a chord (4, 8)
- <4, 7, 1, 9> has a chord (4, 9)
- <6, 9, 1, 8> has a chord (6, 8)
- <6, 9, 4, 1> has a chord (6, 1)
- <6, 9, 1, 4> has a chord (6, 1)
- <6, 1, 7, 8> has a chord (6, 7)
- <6, 1, 4, 9> has a chord (6, 9)
- <6, 8, 7, 1> has a chord (6, 7)
- <6, 8, 4, 9> has a chord (6, 9)
- <7, 5, 8, 6> has a chord (7, 8)
- <7, 5, 0, 6> has a chord (7, 0)
- <7, 5, 8, 4> has a chord (7, 8)
- <7, 5, 0, 8> has a chord (7, 8)
- <7, 1, 8, 6> has a chord (7, 6)
- <7, 1, 4, 9> has a chord (7, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found. There are 22 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.  
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [22].
