Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
        <1, (7, 12), 10>
        <2, (7, 12), 14>
        <3, (5, 14), 12>
        <5, (13, 6), 4>
        <7, (1, 10), 12>
        <8, (6, 13), 4>
        <9, (4, 11), 0>
        <11, (5, 13), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are a total of [40] chordless cycles in the given graph.
