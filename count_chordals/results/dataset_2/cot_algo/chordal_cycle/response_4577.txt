The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 13) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 2, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 2, 13, 12, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 2, 13, 12, 10, 3, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 2, 4, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 2, 4, 8, 9, 14, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 2, 13, 12, 0, 1>
- Cycle 7: <3, 2, 4, 1, 3>
- Cycle 8: <3, 10, 12, 0, 6, 2, 13, 10>
- Cycle 9: <3, 10, 12, 0, 6, 2, 13, 5, 7, 10>
- Cycle 10: <4, 1, 6, 2, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 1, 14, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 10, 12, 0, 6, 2, 4>
- Cycle 13: <4, 10, 12, 0, 6, 2, 13, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle 14: <8, 4, 1, 6, 2, 8>
- Cycle 15: <8, 4, 2, 6, 0, 12, 10, 8>
- Cycle 16: <8, 4, 2, 13, 12, 0, 6, 8>
- Cycle 17: <8, 4, 11, 0, 6, 2, 8>
- Cycle 18: <8, 10, 12, 0, 6, 2, 4, 8>
- Cycle 19: <8, 10, 12, 0, 6, 2, 13, 5, 7, 8>
- Cycle 20: <10, 3, 2, 6, 0, 12, 10>
- Cycle 21: <10, 3, 5, 7, 13, 2, 6, 10>
- Cycle 22: <10, 3, 5, 7, 14, 9, 8, 10>
- Cycle 23: <10, 4, 1, 6, 2, 10>
- Cycle 24: <10, 4, 2, 6, 0, 12, 10>
- Cycle 25: <10, 4, 2, 13, 12, 0, 6, 10>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 6, 2, 4, 0> has chord (6, 4).
- <0, 6, 2, 4, 8, 9, 14, 1> has chord (6, 9).
- <1, 6, 2, 4, 1> has chord (6, 4).
- <4, 1, 6, 2, 4> has chord (1, 2).
- <8, 4, 1, 6, 2, 8> has chord (4, 8).
- <8, 10, 12, 0, 6, 2, 4, 8> has chord (10, 12).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 20 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [20].
