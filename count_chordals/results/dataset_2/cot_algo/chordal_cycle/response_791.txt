Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 9) (14, 8) (17, 7) (17, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 2) (0, 18) (0, 15) (1, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 6) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 6) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 3) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 3) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
  
Cycles of length 4:
1. (5, 1, 5, 3)
2. (5, 3, 2, 19)
3. (5, 7, 17, 15)
4. (9, 14, 8, 16)
5. (4, 18, 6, 15)
6. (7, 5, 1, 5)
7. (7, 19, 2, 15)
8. (7, 17, 15, 0)
9. (14, 9, 12, 11)
10. (17, 7, 5, 1)
11. (17, 15, 0, 18)
12. (18, 4, 3, 2)
13. (18, 19, 2, 15)
14. (18, 6, 15, 0)
15. (19, 4, 18, 6)
16. (19, 7, 17, 15)
17. (0, 18, 4, 19)
18. (0, 15, 2, 19)
19. (1, 5, 7, 17)
20. (11, 8, 14, 9)
21. (11, 12, 9, 14)
22. (11, 6, 18, 4)
23. (16, 8, 14, 9)
24. (16, 6, 18, 4)
25. (8, 14, 9, 12)
26. (8, 11, 12, 9)
27. (8, 16, 6, 18)
28. (2, 19, 7, 17)
29. (2, 15, 17, 7)
30. (2, 3, 4, 18)
31. (2, 13, 12, 9)
32. (15, 17, 7, 5)
33. (15, 0, 18, 4)
34. (15, 2, 3, 4)
35. (15, 6, 18, 4)
36. (12, 9, 14, 8)
37. (12, 11, 6, 18)
38. (12, 15, 2, 3)
39. (13, 2, 19, 4)
40. (13, 12, 9, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
  
Chordal 4-cycle found: 
<1, (5, 3), 2>
<4, (18, 6), 15>
<5, (7, 17), 15>
<9, (14, 8), 16>
<11, (12, 9), 14>
<15, (17, 7), 5>
<18, (6, 15), 4>
<19, (7, 17), 15>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles found is [32].
