Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 4) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 7, 2, 1, 13, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 10, 0, 1, 13, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 11, 6, 12, 13, 1, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 7, 9)
- Cycle 5: (10, 14, 7, 2, 4, 13, 10)
- Cycle 6: (11, 6, 3, 10, 9, 12, 11)
- Cycle 7: (12, 6, 3, 0, 1, 13, 12)
- Cycle 8: (13, 8, 12, 6, 3, 4, 13)
- Cycle 9: (7, 13, 4, 2, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 10: (2, 1, 13, 12, 4, 7, 2)
- Cycle 11: (3, 5, 7, 13, 4, 2, 3)
- Cycle 12: (4, 13, 7, 5, 3, 0, 4)
- Cycle 13: (0, 1, 13, 12, 9, 10, 0)
- Cycle 14: (6, 3, 0, 10, 14, 7, 6)
- Cycle 15: (14, 10, 9, 11, 6, 3, 14)

Step 2:
From the above cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
<1, (2, 4), 7>
<0, (1, 13), 12>
<4, (13, 7), 2>
<3, (5, 7), 13>
<6, (3, 10), 11>

Step 3:
The number of chordless chordal 4-cycles is [5].
