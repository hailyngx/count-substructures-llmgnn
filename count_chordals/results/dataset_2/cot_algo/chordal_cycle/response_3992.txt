Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 3) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 10, 13, 3, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 4, 8, 1, 14, 0)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 1, 14, 2, 4)
- Cycle 4: (8, 1, 9, 13, 3, 8)
- Cycle 5: (8, 1, 14, 12, 6, 8)
- Cycle 6: (1, 9, 13, 3, 12, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 14, 6, 12, 14, 1)
- Cycle 8: (9, 13, 3, 0, 14, 9)
- Cycle 9: (10, 4, 8, 1, 9, 10)
- Cycle 10: (13, 9, 1, 14, 6, 13)

Step 2: 
- The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 1: <0, 4, 13, 3>. The chord is edge (10, 13).

Step 3:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, 4, 13, 3>
