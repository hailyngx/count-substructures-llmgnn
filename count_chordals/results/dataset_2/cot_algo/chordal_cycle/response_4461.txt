Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 19) (2, 8) (2, 0) (29, 6) (29, 5) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 21) (23, 6) (23, 22) (23, 5) (0, 2) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 21) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 15) (3, 20) (3, 28) (3, 17) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 12) (4, 26) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 7) (12, 4) (12, 28) (12, 18) (12, 15) (7, 27) (7, 13) (26, 4) (26, 10) (26, 25) (28, 0) (28, 3) (28, 27) (28, 12) (28, 24) (10, 26) (10, 25) (25, 27) (25, 26) (25, 10) (25, 13) (25, 24) (5, 29) (5, 23) (5, 1) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 15) (1, 9) (1, 5) (21, 22) (21, 0) (21, 18) (13, 7) (13, 25) (13, 19) (18, 12) (18, 21) (18, 15) (24, 28) (24, 25) (15, 22) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 17) (15, 18) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 9-6-23-5-9
- Cycle 2: 9-6-8-15-9
- Cycle 3: 9-17-3-20-9
- Cycle 4: 9-17-15-18-9
- Cycle 5: 9-19-16-11-9
- Cycle 6: 9-19-13-25-9

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (6, 23) 
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (6, 8) 
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (17, 3) 
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (15, 18) 
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (19, 16) 
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (19, 13) 

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (6, 23), 5>
- <2, (6, 8), 15>
- <3, (17, 3), 20>
- <4, (15, 18), 9>
- <5, (19, 16), 11>
- <6, (19, 13), 25>
