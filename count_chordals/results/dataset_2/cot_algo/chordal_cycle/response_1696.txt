Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-9-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-2-5-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-6-9-0
- Cycle 4: 1-2-6-9-1
- Cycle 5: 1-2-5-7-1
- Cycle 6: 1-4-9-8-1
- Cycle 7: 2-5-7-6-2
- Cycle 8: 2-5-9-6-2
- Cycle 9: 3-6-7-8-3
- Cycle 10: 3-6-9-2-3

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: <1, 4>
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <0, 5>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <2, 6>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: <1, 6>
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <2, 5>
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <4, 8>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <5, 7>
- Cycle 8 has a chord: <5, 9>
- Cycle 9 has a chord: <6, 8>
- Cycle 10 has a chord: <3, 9>

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [0] 

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, 4, 9, 0>
- <0, 5, 2, 1>
- <2, 6, 9, 1>
- <1, 2, 6, 9>
- <2, 5, 7, 1>
- <4, 8, 9, 1>
- <5, 7, 6, 2>
- <5, 9, 6, 2>
- <6, 7, 8, 3>
- <3, 9, 2, 6>
