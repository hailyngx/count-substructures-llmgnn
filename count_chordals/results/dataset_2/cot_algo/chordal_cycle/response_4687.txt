Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 23) (27, 2) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 29) (13, 8) (13, 3) (23, 0) (23, 8) (23, 20) (23, 12) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 23) (20, 29) (20, 12) (14, 11) (14, 5) (4, 24) (4, 29) (18, 21) (18, 1) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 18) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 25) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 9) (28, 22) (5, 14) (5, 26) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (1, 18) (1, 22) (15, 5) (15, 12) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 4) (29, 25) (6, 19) (6, 21) (6, 16) (21, 18) (21, 6) (21, 22) (2, 27) (2, 22) (2, 25) (22, 28) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 2) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 24) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 25) (9, 28) (9, 25) (25, 26) (25, 29) (25, 2) (25, 24) (25, 9) (12, 23) (12, 20) (12, 15) (7, 5) (7, 17) (17, 28) (17, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
- (0, 10, 16, 24)
- (0, 20, 8, 29)
- (0, 20, 12, 15)
- (0, 23, 8, 20)
- (4, 24, 16, 19)
- (5, 14, 11, 3)
- (5, 26, 28, 22)
- (5, 19, 16, 6)
- (8, 13, 3, 18)
- (8, 23, 12, 15)
- (8, 20, 29, 25)
- (9, 28, 22, 2)
- (11, 14, 5, 19)
- (12, 23, 0, 20)
- (12, 15, 5, 14)
- (13, 8, 20, 29)
- (15, 12, 23, 0)
- (16, 10, 0, 20)
- (16, 19, 5, 26)
- (16, 24, 4, 29)
- (17, 28, 26, 5)
- (18, 3, 13, 8)
- (18, 21, 6, 19)
- (22, 28, 26, 5)
- (22, 1, 18, 3)
- (24, 4, 29, 25)
- (24, 25, 2, 27)
- (25, 26, 5, 19)
- (28, 26, 5, 14)

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, (10, 20), 16, 24> 
- <0, 20, (8, 29), 12> 
- <0, 23, (8, 20), 12> 
- <5, (14, 11), 3, 19> 
- <5, 14, (26, 28), 22> 
- <5, 19, (16, 6), 21> 
- <8, (13, 3), 18, 23> 
- <8, (23, 12), 15, 20> 
- <8, 20, (29, 25), 13> 
- <9, 28, (22, 2), 25> 

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles: [26]
