Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 15, 1, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 10, 3, 5, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 12, 6, 18, 10, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 15, 1, 17, 0, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 15, 1, 5, 19, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 15, 11, 19, 14, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 2, 5, 1, 15, 7)
- Cycle 8: (7, 2, 5, 19, 11, 7)
- Cycle 9: (8, 18, 10, 4, 12, 8)
- Cycle 10: (8, 18, 6, 12, 4, 8)
- Cycle 11: (8, 15, 7, 13, 2, 8)
- Cycle 12: (12, 4, 10, 18, 6, 12)
- Cycle 13: (1, 5, 19, 11, 15, 1)
- Cycle 14: (1, 15, 7, 13, 2, 1)
- Cycle 15: (1, 15, 8, 16, 1)
- Cycle 16: (17, 0, 3, 10, 18, 17)
- Cycle 17: (5, 1, 15, 11, 19, 5)
- Cycle 18: (19, 5, 1, 17, 0, 19)
- Cycle 19: (15, 1, 5, 3, 0, 15)
- Cycle 20: (15, 7, 13, 2, 5, 15)
- Cycle 21: (15, 11, 19, 14, 7, 15)
- Cycle 22: (13, 7, 2, 9, 11, 13)
- Cycle 23: (10, 18, 6, 12, 4, 10)
- Cycle 24: (10, 4, 12, 6, 18, 10)
- Cycle 25: (10, 3, 0, 17, 1, 10)
- Cycle 26: (3, 0, 17, 1, 15, 3)
- Cycle 27: (2, 7, 15, 11, 19, 2)
- Cycle 28: (2, 9, 11, 19, 14, 2)
- Cycle 29: (11, 19, 5, 1, 15, 11)
- Cycle 30: (11, 15, 7, 2, 9, 11)
- Cycle 31: (16, 8, 18, 10, 3, 16)
- Cycle 32: (6, 12, 4, 10, 18, 6)
  
Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <1, (15, 11), 19)>
- <15, (7, 13), 2)>
- <10, (18, 6), 12)>
- <3, (0, 17), 1)>
- <11, (9, 2), 19)>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [27].
