Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 13) (13, 3) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 11) (19, 18) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 19) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 15) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 14 - 17 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 14 - 17 - 4 - 1 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 3: 2 - 17 - 4 - 12 - 1 - 2
- Cycle 4: 3 - 5 - 8 - 2 - 17 - 14 - 3
- Cycle 5: 3 - 5 - 8 - 11 - 19 - 18 - 15 - 16 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 6: 3 - 6 - 10 - 15 - 18 - 19 - 11 - 8 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 7: 4 - 12 - 9 - 6 - 10 - 18 - 19 - 11 - 4
- Cycle 8: 5 - 13 - 3 - 16 - 15 - 10 - 6 - 3
- Cycle 9: 7 - 0 - 14 - 17 - 2 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chords (14, 2) and (17, 0)
- Cycle 2 has chords (14, 1), (17, 7), and (4, 0)
- Cycle 3 has chords (17, 12) and (4, 2)
- Cycle 4 has chords (17, 8) and (5, 14)
- Cycle 5 has chords (8, 19) and (5, 16)
- Cycle 6 has chords (15, 19) and (10, 18)
- Cycle 7 has chords (12, 10) and (6, 18)
- Cycle 8 has chords (5, 16) and (15, 10)
- Cycle 9 has chords (0, 2) and (14, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (14, 2), (17, 0)>
