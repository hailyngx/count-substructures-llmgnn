Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- There are multiple cycles of length 4 in this graph, such as (5, 9, 7, 1), (5, 3, 1, 8), (4, 0, 3, 5), (7, 6, 2, 1), etc.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.   
- Checking the cycles mentioned above, we find that the cycle (5, 9, 7, 1) has a chord, the edge (9, 1).
- Similarly, the cycle (5, 3, 1, 8) has a chord, the edge (3, 8).
- The cycle (4, 0, 3, 5) also has a chord, the edge (0, 3).
- Finally, the cycle (7, 6, 2, 1) has a chord, the edge (6, 1).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
- Since all cycles found have chords, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
