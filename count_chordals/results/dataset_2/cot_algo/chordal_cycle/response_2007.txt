Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 9, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 2, 6, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 2, 3, 1, 5)
- Cycle 6: (9, 0, 3, 1, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 8, 5, 1, 9)
- Cycle 8: (6, 7, 3, 2, 6)
- Cycle 9: (1, 3, 7, 4, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 8, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 11: (2, 3, 0, 4, 2)
- Cycle 12: (8, 0, 3, 2, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (5, 2)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (9, 0)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (6, 3)
- Cycle 9 has no chord
- Cycle 10 has no chord
- Cycle 11 has no chord
- Cycle 12 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 7 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 9, 6, 5, (9, 6)>
<5, 1, 9, 5, (1, 9)>
<5, 8, 9, 5, (5, 8)>
<5, 2, 6, 5, (5, 2)>
<5, 2, 3, 1, 5>
<9, 0, 3, 1, 9>
<6, 7, 3, 2, 6>
