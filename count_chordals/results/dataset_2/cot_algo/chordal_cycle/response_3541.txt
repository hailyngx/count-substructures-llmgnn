Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 5-9-7-4
- Cycle 2: 5-9-3-4
- Cycle 3: 5-9-3-1
- Cycle 4: 5-9-2-1
- Cycle 5: 5-6-4-7

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (7, 4), 9> (Cycle 1 has one chord 7-4)
- <2, (9, 3), 4> (Cycle 2 has one chord 9-3)
- <3, (9, 1), 4> (Cycle 3 has one chord 9-1)
- <4, (9, 2), 1> (Cycle 4 has one chord 9-2)
- <5, (6, 7), 5> (Cycle 5 has one chord 6-7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
