Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 5) (15, 2) (15, 7) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 15) (7, 17) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <11, 16, 4, 5>
- <11, 2, 12, 14>
- <11, 2, 15, 7>
- <16, 11, 4, 5>
- <1, 3, 9, 12>
- <1, 3, 9, 18>
- <1, 18, 3, 5>
- <3, 1, 18, 5>
- <3, 18, 9, 19>
- <4, 11, 16, 5>
- <4, 5, 3, 18>
- <18, 3, 9, 19>
- <18, 9, 3, 5>
- <2, 11, 16, 5>
- <2, 11, 17, 7>
- <2, 15, 7, 17>
- <12, 2, 11, 16>
- <12, 2, 15, 7>
- <12, 9, 3, 18>
- <9, 3, 18, 5>
- <9, 18, 1, 10>
- <15, 2, 11, 16>
- <15, 2, 12, 14>
- <15, 7, 17, 11>
- <19, 2, 11, 16>
- <19, 2, 15, 7>
- <19, 17, 11, 16>
- <6, 0, 3, 9>
- <6, 0, 8, 10>
- <6, 13, 14, 12>
- <17, 11, 16, 5>
- <17, 7, 15, 2>
- <0, 3, 18, 9>
- <7, 15, 2, 11>
- <5, 3, 18, 9>
- <14, 12, 2, 15>
- <10, 1, 18, 3>
- <13, 6, 0, 3>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <11, 16, 4, 5>, chords: (2, 12)
- <11, 2, 12, 14>, chords: (11, 16)
- <11, 2, 15, 7>, chords: (16, 4)
- <16, 11, 4, 5>, chords: (2, 12)
- <4, 11, 16, 5>, chords: (12, 2)
- <2, 11, 17, 7>, chords: (16, 4)
- <12, 2, 11, 16>, chords: (14, 13)
- <15, 2, 7, 17>, chords: (11, 16)
- <19, 2, 15, 7>, chords: (11, 16)
- <17, 11, 16, 5>, chords: (2, 12)

Step 3:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final answer is [10].
