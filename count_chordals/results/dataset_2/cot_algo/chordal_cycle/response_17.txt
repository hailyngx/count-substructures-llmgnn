- Cycle 30: (29, 7), (7, 29), (29, 16), (16, 29)
- ... (more cycles)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <1, (0, 15), 7> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (0, 15).
- <2, (17, 26), 10> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (17, 26).
- <15, (20, 25), 3> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (20, 25).
- <15, (0, 15), 21> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (0, 15).
- <16, (20, 25), 22> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (20, 25).
- <26, (1, 26), 17> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (1, 26).
- <0, (15, 0), 8> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (15, 0).
- <13, (0, 1), 21> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (0, 1).
- <29, (7, 29), 16> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (7, 29).
- ... (more chordal cycles)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [9].
