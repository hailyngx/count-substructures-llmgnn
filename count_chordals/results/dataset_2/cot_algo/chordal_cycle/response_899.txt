Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more are:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-3-6-4
- Cycle 2: 4-9-1-5-4
- Cycle 3: 4-5-8-7-4
- Cycle 4: 4-0-8-9-4
- Cycle 5: 7-4-5-1-7
- Cycle 6: 7-8-5-6-7
- Cycle 7: 1-9-8-5-1
- Cycle 8: 3-1-9-4-3
- Cycle 9: 0-4-5-6-0
- Cycle 10: 9-1-2-6-9

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 7 (4-3-6)
- Cycle 2 has a chord 1 (4-5-9)
- Cycle 3 has a chord 8 (4-7-8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord 0 (4-9-8)
- Cycle 5 has a chord 5 (7-1-4)
- Cycle 6 has a chord 6 (7-5-8)
- Cycle 7 has a chord 1 (1-5-9)
- Cycle 8 has a chord 9 (3-1-4)
- Cycle 9 has a chord 4 (0-5-6)
- Cycle 10 has a chord 2 (9-1-6)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles: 0

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <4, 7, 3, 6>
- <4, 9, 1, 5>
- <4, 5, 8, 7>
- <4, 0, 8, 9>
- <7, 4, 5, 1>
- <7, 8, 5, 6>
- <1, 9, 8, 5>
- <3, 1, 9, 4>
- <0, 4, 5, 6>
- <9, 1, 2, 6>
