Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 13) (16, 8) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 13) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 18) (7, 14) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (6, 8) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 14) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 12) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 12) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 9) (12, 5) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 19) (13, 16) (13, 18) (13, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 11 - 0 - 2 - 1 - 11
- Cycle 2: 5 - 3 - 12 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 3: 6 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 4: 13 - 16 - 8 - 10 - 13
- Cycle 5: 14 - 1 - 15 - 9 - 14
- Cycle 6: 17 - 11 - 0 - 5 - 17
- Cycle 7: 18 - 7 - 2 - 14 - 18
- Cycle 8: 12 - 10 - 8 - 6 - 12

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
<11, 1, 0, 2>
<5, 12, 9, 15>
<6, 4, 8, 2>
<13, 10, 8, 16>
<14, 2, 1, 15>
<17, 0, 11, 5>
<18, 14, 2, 7>
<12, 6, 8, 10>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [8].
