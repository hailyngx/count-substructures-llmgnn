Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 13) (1, 2) (1, 19) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 17) (7, 0) (15, 5) (15, 6) (8, 17) (8, 19) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 19) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 18) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 18) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 18) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 15 - 5 with no chord
- Cycle 2: 2 - 1 - 19 - 16 - 2 with no chord
- Cycle 3: 18 - 3 - 0 - 7 - 17 - 19 - 16 - 18 with no chord
- Cycle 4: 6 - 15 - 5 - 14 - 6 with no chord
- Cycle 5: 6 - 15 - 5 - 9 - 6 with no chord
- Cycle 6: 4 - 2 - 1 - 19 - 8 - 17 - 7 - 0 - 3 - 4 with no chord
- Cycle 7: 4 - 2 - 1 - 19 - 8 - 17 - 7 - 0 - 2 - 4 with no chord
- Cycle 8: 11 - 6 - 15 - 5 - 14 - 11 with no chord
- Cycle 9: 11 - 6 - 15 - 5 - 9 - 11 with no chord
- Cycle 10: 11 - 6 - 9 - 4 - 11 with no chord
- Cycle 11: 11 - 6 - 9 - 3 - 18 - 14 - 11 with no chord
- Cycle 12: 13 - 6 - 15 - 5 - 14 - 18 - 13 with no chord
- Cycle 13: 13 - 6 - 15 - 5 - 9 - 13 with no chord
- Cycle 14: 13 - 6 - 9 - 4 - 11 - 13 with no chord
- Cycle 15: 13 - 6 - 9 - 3 - 18 - 12 - 13 with no chord

Step 2:  
All the cycles above do not have any chords, so all are chordless.

Step 3:  
The total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [15].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 19, 8, 17>
- <0, 3, 18, 14>
- <2, 1, 19, 8>
- <3, 0, 7, 17>
- <4, 9, 6, 15>
- <5, 9, 6, 15>
- <6, 15, 5, 14>
- <9, 6, 15, 5>
- <11, 6, 9, 4>
- <13, 6, 15, 5>
- <14, 5, 9, 6>
- <15, 5, 14, 6>
- <16, 0, 7, 17>
- <17, 7, 0, 3>
- <18, 3, 9, 6>
