- Cycle 7: (2, 5, 14, 6)
- Cycle 8: (2, 8, 7, 3)
- Cycle 9: (2, 8, 9, 10)
- Cycle 10: (2, 14, 13, 9)
- Cycle 11: (4, 3, 7, 12)
- Cycle 12: (4, 3, 13, 9)
- Cycle 13: (4, 5, 14, 6)
- Cycle 14: (4, 10, 1, 3)
- Cycle 15: (5, 2, 1, 10)
- Cycle 16: (5, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 17: (5, 11, 3, 7)
- Cycle 18: (5, 14, 6, 12)
- Cycle 19: (6, 8, 7, 3)
- Cycle 20: (6, 12, 7, 3)
- Cycle 21: (6, 14, 13, 9)
- Cycle 22: (8, 2, 1, 10)
- Cycle 23: (8, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 24: (8, 9, 10, 1)
- Cycle 25: (9, 10, 1, 3)
- Cycle 26: (9, 12, 7, 3)
- Cycle 27: (9, 13, 4, 10)
- Cycle 28: (10, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 29: (10, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 30: (10, 9, 13, 4)
- Cycle 31: (11, 5, 2, 8)
- Cycle 32: (11, 3, 7, 12)
- Cycle 33: (12, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 34: (12, 9, 10, 1)
- Cycle 35: (12, 13, 4, 3)
- Cycle 36: (13, 9, 10, 1)
- Cycle 37: (13, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 38: (13, 12, 7, 3)
- Cycle 39: (14, 6, 12, 7)
- Cycle 40: (14, 13, 4, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The chordal 4-cycles are:
    - <1, (9, 13), 3>
    - <1, (10, 4), 3>
    - <2, (8, 9), 10>
    - <2, (5, 11), 3>
    - <2, (14, 6), 5>
    - <3, (7, 12), 1>
    - <4, (10, 1), 3>
    - <5, (2, 8), 10>
    - <6, (12, 7), 3>
    - <7, (3, 1), 10>
    - <8, (2, 1), 10>
    - <9, (10, 1), 3>
    - <11, (3, 7), 12>
    - <13, (9, 10), 1>
    - <14, (6, 12), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
The number of chordless cycles found are [15].
