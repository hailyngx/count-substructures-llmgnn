Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (1, 17) (1, 13) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 5) (5, 17) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 18) (18, 13) (18, 9) (19, 0) (19, 7) (6, 17) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 12) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 15) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 3) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 17) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 7) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are two cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. Cycle: 2 - 3 - 10 - 16 - 2
2. Cycle: 5 - 17 - 12 - 9 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

1. Cycle: 2 - 3 - 10 - 16 - 2
   Chord: (2, 16)
   Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (2, 16), 3, 10>
   
2. Cycle: 5 - 17 - 12 - 9 - 5
   Chord: (5, 12)
   Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (5, 12), 17, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final number is [2].
