Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 27) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 29) (16, 20) (1, 11) (21, 7) (21, 10) (7, 21) (7, 29) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 15) (3, 25) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 24) (13, 23) (6, 18) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 0) (28, 6) (28, 2) (0, 6) (0, 23) (14, 9) (14, 10) (19, 26) (19, 10) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 24) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 26) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 5) (10, 21) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 9) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 17) (2, 25) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 20) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 20) (29, 11) (29, 16) (29, 7) (29, 27) (9, 14) (9, 10) (15, 22) (15, 23) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 0) (23, 15) (27, 11) (27, 29) (4, 5) (4, 20) (20, 16) (20, 2) (20, 5) (20, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 11-16-20-2-11
- Cycle 2: 11-29-27-29-11
- Cycle 3: 16-20-5-17-16
- Cycle 4: 21-10-14-9-21
- Cycle 5: 18-17-13-24-18
- Cycle 6: 25-2-20-4-25
- Cycle 7: 12-17-5-2-12
- Cycle 8: 29-7-21-10-29
- Cycle 9: 6-10-19-24-6
- Cycle 10: 26-24-13-8-26
- Cycle 11: 3-12-8-5-3
- Cycle 12: 22-15-23-0-22

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord (2, 16)
- Cycle 2 has chord (27, 29)
- Cycle 3 has chord (5, 16)
- Cycle 4 has chord (10, 14)
- Cycle 5 has chord (13, 18)
- Cycle 6 has chord (2, 20)
- Cycle 7 has chord (2, 17)
- Cycle 8 has chord (10, 21)
- Cycle 9 has chord (10, 24)
- Cycle 10 has chord (13, 24)
- Cycle 11 has chord (8, 12)
- Cycle 12 has chord (15, 23)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found = [11]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<11, (2, 16)>
<27, (11, 29)>
<16, (5, 16)>
<21, (10, 14)>
<21, (13, 18)>
<25, (2, 20)>
<17, (2, 17)>
<29, (10, 21)>
<24, (10, 24)>
<26, (13, 24)>
<22, (8, 12)>
