Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 15) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 18) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 13) (11, 3) (11, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (15, 1) (15, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 6) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 10) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 17) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 17) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 10, 5>
2. Cycle 2: <3, 1, 15, 2, 3>
3. Cycle 3: <3, 0, 14, 13, 3>
4. Cycle 4: <3, 19, 10, 5, 16, 8, 6, 17, 2, 3>
5. Cycle 5: <3, 11, 0, 14, 13, 7, 6, 8, 16, 17, 2, 3>
6. Cycle 6: <2, 9, 4, 18, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

1. Cycle 1 (Chordal 4-cycle): <5, 9, 4, 10, 5> - Chord: (9,4)
2. Cycle 2 (Chordal 4-cycle): <3, 1, 15, 2, 3> - Chord: (1,2)
3. Cycle 3 (Not a Chordal 4-cycle)
4. Cycle 4 (Not a Chordal 4-cycle)
5. Cycle 5 (Not a Chordal 4-cycle)
6. Cycle 6 (Chordal 4-cycle): <2, 9, 4, 18, 2> - Chord: (9,18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].

Unique Chordal 4-Cycles:
1. <5, 9, 4, 10, 5> with chord (9,4)
2. <2, 9, 4, 18, 2> with chord (9,18)
