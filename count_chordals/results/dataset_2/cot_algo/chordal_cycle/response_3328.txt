Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (1, 4, 6, 5, 1)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 4, 6, 0)
        - Cycle 3: (0, 4, 1, 5, 0)
        - Cycle 4: (2, 7, 9, 2)
        - Cycle 5: (2, 7, 8, 3, 2)
        - Cycle 6: (0, 4, 7, 8, 0)
        - Cycle 7: (1, 4, 7, 8, 3, 1)
        - Cycle 8: (1, 4, 0, 6, 3, 1)
        - Cycle 9: (1, 4, 0, 8, 7, 1)
        - Cycle 10: (2, 7, 8, 0, 9, 2)
        - Cycle 11: (2, 7, 9, 0, 8, 2)
        - Cycle 12: (2, 7, 4, 0, 8, 3, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord
        - Cycle 1: (1, 4, 6, 5, 1) <(1, 5)>
        - Cycle 2: (0, 4, 6, 0) <(0, 6)>
        - Cycle 3: (0, 4, 1, 5, 0) <(1, 5)>
        - Cycle 4: (2, 7, 9, 2) no chord
        - Cycle 5: (2, 7, 8, 3, 2) no chord
        - Cycle 6: (0, 4, 7, 8, 0) <(4, 8)>
        - Cycle 7: (1, 4, 7, 8, 3, 1) <(4, 8)>
        - Cycle 8: (1, 4, 0, 6, 3, 1) <(0, 6)>
        - Cycle 9: (1, 4, 0, 8, 7, 1) <(0, 8)>
        - Cycle 10: (2, 7, 8, 0, 9, 2) <(8, 9)>
        - Cycle 11: (2, 7, 9, 0, 8, 2) <(9, 8)>
        - Cycle 12: (2, 7, 4, 0, 8, 3, 2) <(4, 8)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are [2] chordal 4-cycles found.

The unique chordal 4-cycles are <1, 4, 6, 5> and <2, 7, 9, 2>.
