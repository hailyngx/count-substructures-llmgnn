Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

- The possible cycles of length 4 or more are:
   - Cycle 1: 1-9-7-3-1
   - Cycle 2: 1-9-7-6-3-1
   - Cycle 3: 2-1-9-7-2
   - Cycle 4: 2-1-3-7-2
   - Cycle 5: 3-6-7-4-8-3
   - Cycle 6: 3-6-8-4-7-3
   - Cycle 7: 4-8-6-7-4
   - Cycle 8: 5-7-6-8-5
   - Cycle 9: 5-9-1-8-5
   - Cycle 10: 5-9-7-6-8-5
   - Cycle 11: 7-6-8-5-7
   - Cycle 12: 7-9-5-8-7
   - Cycle 13: 7-9-1-8-7
   - Cycle 14: 8-6-7-5-8
   - Cycle 15: 8-6-3-1-8
   - Cycle 16: 8-6-7-2-8
   - Cycle 17: 9-1-3-7-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- The cycles with exactly one chord are:
   - Cycle 1: 1-9-7-3-1 has a chord 9-3
   - Cycle 2: 2-1-9-7-2 has a chord 1-7
   - Cycle 3: 3-6-7-4-8-3 has a chord 6-4
   - Cycle 4: 5-7-6-8-5 has a chord 7-8
   - Cycle 5: 5-9-7-6-8-5 has a chord 9-6
   - Cycle 6: 7-6-8-5-7 has a chord 6-5
   - Cycle 7: 7-9-5-8-7 has a chord 9-8
   - Cycle 8: 7-9-1-8-7 has a chord 9-1
   - Cycle 9: 8-6-7-5-8 has a chord 6-5
   - Cycle 10: 9-1-3-7-9 has a chord 1-3

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, which are: 
<1, (9-3)>
<2, (1-7)>
<3, (6-4)>
<4, (7-8)>
<5, (9-6)>
<6, (6-5)>
<7, (9-8)>
<8, (9-1)>
<9, (6-5)>
<10, (1-3)>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [10].
