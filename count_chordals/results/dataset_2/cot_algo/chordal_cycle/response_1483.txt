Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 25) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 17) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 19) (9, 12) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 3) (27, 26) (7, 21) (7, 2) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 18) (21, 29) (20, 25) (20, 2) (25, 11) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 18) (25, 24) (26, 5) (26, 27) (26, 22) (17, 5) (17, 29) (17, 18) (17, 4) (29, 21) (29, 17) (22, 27) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 14) (22, 3) (10, 5) (10, 21) (10, 8) (19, 9) (19, 22) (14, 22) (14, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 28) (13, 21) (13, 12) (28, 0) (28, 25) (28, 1) (28, 23) (8, 10) (8, 6) (15, 6) (23, 28) (23, 6) (2, 7) (2, 20) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 24) (12, 3) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 4) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 24) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 23) (3, 27) (3, 22) (3, 12) (3, 18) (18, 21) (18, 25) (18, 17) (18, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 19, 22, 26, 27, 0)
- Cycle 2: (7, 21, 29, 17, 5, 10)
- Cycle 3: (21, 29, 17, 5, 26, 22)
- Cycle 4: (21, 29, 17, 4, 24, 25)
- Cycle 5: (1, 0, 27, 26, 22, 19)
- Cycle 6: (1, 7, 21, 29, 17, 4)
- Cycle 7: (1, 7, 21, 13, 12, 9)
- Cycle 8: (1, 28, 25, 24, 4, 0)
- Cycle 9: (8, 10, 5, 17, 29, 21)
- Cycle 10: (15, 6, 8, 10, 21, 7)
- Cycle 11: (23, 28, 25, 24, 4, 17)
- Cycle 12: (2, 7, 21, 29, 17, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <5, 9, (19, 22), 26>
- <7, 21, (29, 17), 5>
- <21, 29, (17, 5), 26>
- <21, 29, (17, 4), 24>
- <1, 0, (27, 26), 22>
- <1, 7, (21, 29), 17>
- <1, 7, (21, 13), 12>
- <1, 28, (25, 24), 4>
- <8, 10, (5, 17), 29>
- <15, 6, (8, 10), 21>
- <23, 28, (25, 24), 4>
- <2, 7, (21, 29), 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final number is [12].
