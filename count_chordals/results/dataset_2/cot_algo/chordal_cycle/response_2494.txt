Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 10) (1, 9) (1, 13) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <5, 6, 7, 10>
2. Cycle <5, 6, 8, 2>
3. Cycle <5, 8, 9, 2>
4. Cycle <5, 14, 0, 12>
5. Cycle <6, 7, 12, 4>
6. Cycle <7, 10, 4, 12>
7. Cycle <7, 14, 0, 12>
8. Cycle <10, 6, 5, 11>
9. Cycle <10, 4, 12, 0>
10. Cycle <12, 7, 14, 0>
11. Cycle <12, 4, 2, 8>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle <5, 6, 7, 10> has chord (6, 7): <5, (6, 7), 10>
2. Cycle <5, 6, 8, 2> has no chord
3. Cycle <5, 8, 9, 2> has no chord
4. Cycle <5, 14, 0, 12> has chord (0, 14): <5, (0, 14), 12>
5. Cycle <6, 7, 12, 4> has chord (7, 12): <6, (7, 12), 4>
6. Cycle <7, 10, 4, 12> has no chord
7. Cycle <7, 14, 0, 12> has no chord
8. Cycle <10, 6, 5, 11> has chord (6, 5): <10, (6, 5), 11>
9. Cycle <10, 4, 12, 0> has no chord
10. Cycle <12, 7, 14, 0> has no chord
11. Cycle <12, 4, 2, 8> has chord (4, 8): <12, (4, 8), 2>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have a total of [4].
