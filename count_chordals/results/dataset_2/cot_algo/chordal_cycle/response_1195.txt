Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one non-adjacent chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <1, (10, 8), 5>
- <4, (12, 10), 1>
- <4, (9, 13), 8>
- <5, (8, 12), 4>
- <6, (13, 8), 2>
- <8, (4, 12), 5>
- <9, (3, 13), 6>
- <10, (8, 9), 4>
- <13, (6, 9), 8>
- <12, (4, 14), 1>

Step 3:
There are a total of [10] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
