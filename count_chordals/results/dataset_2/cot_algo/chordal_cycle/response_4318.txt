Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1-6-2-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-6-7-1
- Cycle 3: 1-8-9-3-1
- Cycle 4: 3-6-2-5-3
- Cycle 5: 3-4-7-8-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 <2, 6, 1>: Chord (2, 6)
- Cycle 2 <1, 6, 7>: Chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 3 <1, 3, 9>: Chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 4 <3, 2, 5>: Chord (2, 5)
- Cycle 5 <3, 7, 8>: Chord (7, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 6, 1>
<3, 2, 5>
<3, 7, 8>
