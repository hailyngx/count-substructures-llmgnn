Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 2) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) 

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in this graph is <0, (4, 5), 14> with exactly one chord connecting vertices 4 and 5.
The total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
