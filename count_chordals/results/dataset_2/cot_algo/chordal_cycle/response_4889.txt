Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 19) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 8) (17, 8) (17, 11) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 15) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 12) (16, 7) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 6) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 18) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (5, 8) (5, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 1) (11, 17) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 13) (12, 9) (12, 3) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 18) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle: 4-1-14-19-4
- Cycle: 1-8-17-11-1
- Cycle: 1-14-19-18-1
- Cycle: 8-17-11-1-8
- Cycle: 14-19-18-16-14

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 4-1-14-19-4 has one chord, (1, 19) 
- Cycle 1-8-17-11-1 has one chord, (8, 11)
- Cycle 1-14-19-18-1 has one chord, (14, 18)
- Cycle 8-17-11-1-8 has one chord, (17, 1)
- Cycle 14-19-18-16-14 has one chord, (19, 18)

Step 3:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, (1, 19), 14>
- <1, (8, 11), 17>
- <1, (14, 18), 19>
- <8, (17, 1), 11>
- <14, (19, 18), 16>
