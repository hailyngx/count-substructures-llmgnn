Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (5, 9, 6, 5)
- (5, 9, 8, 5)
- (5, 2, 6, 5)
- (9, 6, 5, 9)
- (9, 6, 3, 9)
- (9, 6, 0, 9)
- (9, 6, 2, 9)
- (6, 3, 0, 6)
- (6, 3, 9, 6)
- (6, 3, 8, 6)
- (6, 2, 5, 6)
- (1, 4, 8, 1)
- (1, 8, 9, 1)
- (1, 8, 3, 1)
- (1, 8, 4, 1)
- (1, 7, 9, 1)
- (3, 9, 7, 3)
- (3, 6, 5, 3)
- (3, 6, 9, 3)
- (3, 6, 0, 3)
- (3, 0, 4, 3)
- (3, 0, 6, 3)
- (3, 0, 8, 3)
- (3, 8, 9, 3)
- (4, 0, 3, 4)
- (4, 0, 7, 4)
- (4, 8, 1, 4)
- (7, 9, 8, 7)
- (7, 1, 8, 7)
- (7, 0, 4, 7)
- (7, 2, 5, 7)
- (8, 9, 6, 8)
- (8, 1, 7, 8)
- (8, 3, 9, 8)
- (8, 3, 1, 8)
- (8, 4, 1, 8)
- (2, 5, 6, 2)
- (2, 7, 1, 2)
- (0, 3, 9, 0)
- (0, 3, 6, 0)
- (0, 3, 8, 0)
- (0, 4, 1, 0)
- (0, 4, 7, 0)
- (0, 6, 9, 0)
- (0, 6, 3, 0)
- (0, 6, 2, 0)
- (0, 7, 9, 0)
- (0, 7, 1, 0)

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles found are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 4, 8, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 8, 9, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 8, 3, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 8, 4, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 7, 9, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <3, 9, 7, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, 9, 8, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, 1, 7, 8>

Step 3:
There are a total of [8] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
