Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 3 - 5 
- Cycle 2: 9 - 6 - 3 - 2 - 9 
- Cycle 3: 6 - 3 - 5 - 8 - 6 
- Cycle 4: 3 - 5 - 8 - 13 - 3 
- Cycle 5: 1 - 10 - 2 - 3 - 1 
- Cycle 6: 10 - 2 - 9 - 13 - 10 
- Cycle 7: 11 - 6 - 0 - 1 - 11 
- Cycle 8: 1 - 4 - 8 - 12 - 1 
- Cycle 9: 4 - 7 - 0 - 6 - 4 
- Cycle 10: 7 - 13 - 9 - 5 - 7 
- Cycle 11: 13 - 8 - 4 - 14 - 13 
- Cycle 12: 0 - 7 - 13 - 8 - 0 
- Cycle 13: 2 - 4 - 8 - 12 - 2 
- Cycle 14: 10 - 14 - 4 - 2 - 10 

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (9, 3).
- Cycle 2 <9, (6, 2), 3> has more than one chord, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 <6, (5, 8), 3> has more than one chord, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 4 <3, (5, 13), 8> has more than one chord, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 5 <1, (10, 3), 2> has more than one chord, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 6 <10, (2, 13), 9> has more than one chord, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 7 <11, (6, 0), 1> has more than one chord, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (4, 8).
- Cycle 9 <4, (7, 6), 0> has more than one chord, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 10 <7, (13, 9), 5> has more than one chord, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 11 <13, (8, 4), 7> has more than one chord, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 12 <0, (7, 13), 8> has more than one chord, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 13 <2, (4, 8), 12> has more than one chord, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 14 <10, (14, 2), 4> has more than one chord, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, which are [2].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are <5, (9, 3), 6> and <8, (4, 8), 12>.
