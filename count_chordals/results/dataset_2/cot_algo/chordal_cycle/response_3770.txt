Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 0, 1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 6, 1, 7, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 8, 4, 7, 9)
- Cycle 5: (6, 2, 0, 1, 6)
- Cycle 6: (1, 7, 4, 8, 1)
- Cycle 7: (3, 4, 7, 1, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 6, 5, 4)
- Cycle 9: (7, 1, 0, 9, 7)
- Cycle 10: (8, 4, 3, 5, 8)
- Cycle 11: (2, 0, 9, 6, 2)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (6, 0), 5> - Chord: (6, 0) 
- <3, (0, 4), 5> - Chord: (0, 4)
- <9, (6, 7), 8> - Chord: (6, 7)
- <6, (1, 8), 9> - Chord: (1, 8)
- <7, (1, 4), 3> - Chord: (1, 4)
- <8, (3, 5), 4> - Chord: (3, 5)
- <4, (7, 1), 8> - Chord: (7, 1)
- <5, (4, 6), 3> - Chord: (4, 6)
- <2, (0, 9), 6> - Chord: (0, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
We found 9 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [9].
