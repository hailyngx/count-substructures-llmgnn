Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:

- Cycle 1: 0-3-6-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-9-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-1-5-0
- Cycle 4: 0-4-3-1-0
- Cycle 5: 1-2-9-5-1
- Cycle 6: 2-0-3-9-2
- Cycle 7: 2-1-5-9-2
- Cycle 8: 3-4-1-2-3
- Cycle 9: 3-6-7-9-3
- Cycle 10: 4-0-3-1-4
- Cycle 11: 6-3-4-0-6
- Cycle 12: 7-9-2-1-7
- Cycle 13: 8-6-3-0-8
- Cycle 14: 8-7-9-2-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the above cycles, the chordal 4-cycle is:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (3, 7), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
