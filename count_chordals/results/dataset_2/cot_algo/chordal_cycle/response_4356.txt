Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 20) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 10) (13, 22) (13, 24) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 25) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 6) (29, 15) (18, 28) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 14) (23, 22) (23, 2) (23, 3) (23, 21) (23, 0) (12, 27) (12, 15) (27, 12) (27, 3) (3, 23) (3, 27) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 9) (25, 22) (25, 3) (0, 23) (0, 24) (6, 29) (6, 1) (6, 19) (28, 18) (28, 3) (5, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (20, 11) (20, 29) (20, 1) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 15) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 21) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 26) (14, 4) (14, 15) (26, 14) (26, 21) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 20) (1, 24) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 9) (24, 13) (24, 0) (24, 8) (24, 1) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 21) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 8) (15, 14) (21, 23) (21, 19) (21, 26) (21, 9) (4, 16) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (10, 11, 20, 29)
- Cycle 2: (10, 16, 17, 19)
- Cycle 3: (10, 2, 23, 3)
- Cycle 4: (10, 2, 29, 20)
- Cycle 5: (10, 14, 26, 21)
- Cycle 6: (11, 20, 29, 2)
- Cycle 7: (13, 22, 23, 3)
- Cycle 8: (13, 22, 25, 3)
- Cycle 9: (13, 7, 1, 6)
- Cycle 10: (16, 17, 19, 21)
- Cycle 11: (16, 4, 14, 26)
- Cycle 12: (16, 10, 2, 29)
- Cycle 13: (19, 17, 16, 10)
- Cycle 14: (19, 6, 1, 7)
- Cycle 15: (19, 6, 29, 20)
- Cycle 16: (19, 17, 9, 21)
- Cycle 17: (23, 22, 13, 7)
- Cycle 18: (23, 22, 25, 3)
- Cycle 19: (23, 2, 10, 14)
- Cycle 20: (23, 3, 9, 17)
- Cycle 21: (27, 12, 15, 29)
- Cycle 22: (27, 3, 23, 22)
- Cycle 23: (28, 18, 19, 17)
- Cycle 24: (28, 3, 9, 17)
- Cycle 25: (29, 20, 1, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (20, 29), 10> 
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (10, 16), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (13, 22), 7> 
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (16, 10), 2> 
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (17, 19), 16> 
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (2, 23), 10> 
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (3, 23), 22> 
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (9, 17), 21> 
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (19, 6), 17> 
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (22, 13), 3> 
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <11, (23, 2), 14> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [25]
