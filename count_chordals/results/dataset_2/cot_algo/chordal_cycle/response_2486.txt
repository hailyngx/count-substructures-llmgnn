Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 14) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. 

To determine the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph, we need to follow the steps provided earlier.

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- One example of a 4-cycle in the graph is <6, 9, 14, 8, 6>.
- Another example is <7, 14, 9, 3, 7>.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The 4-cycle <6, 9, 14, 8, 6> has a chord (9, 8).
- The 4-cycle <7, 14, 9, 3, 7> has a chord (14, 3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [0].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <6, 9, 14, 8, 6> with the chord (9, 8) inside brackets [].
