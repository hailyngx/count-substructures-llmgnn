Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 1, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 1, 0, 4, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 3, 1, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (9, 5, 1, 6, 9)
        - Cycle 5: (9, 6, 4, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 6: (9, 3, 1, 6, 9)
        - Cycle 7: (7, 9, 8, 4, 7)
        - Cycle 8: (7, 4, 3, 9, 7)
        - Cycle 9: (6, 9, 8, 0, 6)
        - Cycle 10: (6, 4, 3, 1, 6)
        - Cycle 11: (6, 1, 5, 2, 6)
        - Cycle 12: (1, 5, 3, 0, 1)
        - Cycle 13: (1, 6, 9, 8, 1)
        - Cycle 14: (1, 3, 4, 7, 1)
        - Cycle 15: (3, 5, 9, 7, 3)
        - Cycle 16: (3, 9, 8, 1, 3)
        - Cycle 17: (3, 4, 7, 2, 3)
        - Cycle 18: (8, 9, 6, 4, 8)
        - Cycle 19: (8, 4, 3, 1, 8)
        - Cycle 20: (8, 0, 1, 5, 8)
        - Cycle 21: (0, 4, 3, 1, 0)
        - Cycle 22: (0, 1, 6, 9, 0)
        - Cycle 23: (2, 5, 1, 3, 2)
        - Cycle 24: (2, 7, 9, 6, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - <5, 9, 1, 6, 5> has a chord: (6, 1)
        - <5, 1, 0, 4, 5> has a chord: (0, 4)
        - <9, 5, 1, 6, 9> has a chord: (1, 6)
        - <9, 6, 4, 7, 9> has a chord: (4, 7)
        - <7, 9, 8, 4, 7> has a chord: (8, 4)
        - <6, 9, 8, 0, 6> has a chord: (8, 0)
        - <6, 4, 3, 1, 6> has a chord: (3, 1)
        - <2, 5, 1, 3, 2> has a chord: (1, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [8].
