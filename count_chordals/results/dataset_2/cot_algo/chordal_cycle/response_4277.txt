Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 17) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 8) (7, 26) (3, 25) (3, 2) (3, 12) (25, 5) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 15) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 20) (22, 17) (22, 8) (8, 7) (8, 22) (8, 23) (8, 29) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 28) (6, 28) (6, 11) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 2) (28, 20) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 15) (26, 7) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 14) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 2) (10, 1) (10, 2) (21, 23) (21, 19) (14, 26) (14, 15) (0, 11) (0, 17) (1, 23) (1, 10) (1, 29) (1, 27) (29, 8) (29, 1) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 21) (20, 5) (20, 18) (20, 28) (20, 13) (24, 17) (16, 25) (16, 15) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 0) (17, 24) (27, 1) (27, 2) (2, 3) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 27) (12, 3) (15, 4) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 16) 

Response:
Step 1:  
- Cycle 1: (5, 20, 18, 4, 5)  
- Cycle 2: (9, 17, 22, 8, 9)  
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 8, 22, 4)  
- Cycle 4: (3, 25, 16, 15, 3)  
- Cycle 5: (25, 15, 14, 26, 25)  
- Cycle 6: (18, 26, 14, 15, 18)  
- Cycle 7: (7, 8, 23, 28, 7)  
- Cycle 8: (6, 11, 2, 3, 6)  
- Cycle 9: (13, 26, 14, 15, 13)  
- Cycle 10: (11, 0, 17, 24, 11)  
- Cycle 11: (10, 1, 29, 8, 10)  
- Cycle 12: (21, 19, 7, 8, 21)  

Step 2:  
- Cycle 1: (5, 20, 18, 4, 5) <(5, 18)>  
- Cycle 8: (6, 11, 2, 3, 6) <(6, 3)>  
- Cycle 11: (10, 1, 29, 8, 10) <(10, 29)>  

Step 3:  
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found:
