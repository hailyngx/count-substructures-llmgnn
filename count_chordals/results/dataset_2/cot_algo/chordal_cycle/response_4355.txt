Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<0, 6, 2, 4>
<0, 6, 2, 9>
<0, 6, 11, 4>
<0, 6, 11, 8>
<0, 6, 11, 12>
<0, 10, 1, 14>
<0, 10, 2, 13>
<0, 10, 7, 14>
<0, 11, 4, 8>
<0, 11, 4, 2>
<0, 11, 12, 1>
<0, 11, 12, 5>
<1, 10, 2, 13>
<1, 10, 7, 14>
<1, 12, 5, 14>
<2, 10, 7, 14>
<2, 13, 3, 5>
<2, 13, 3, 11>
<2, 13, 11, 6>
<4, 8, 11, 6>
<6, 0, 10, 7>
<6, 2, 10, 7>
<7, 9, 12, 5>
<8, 4, 11, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<0, 6, 2, 4> has chord (6, 4)
<0, 6, 2, 9> has chord (6, 9)
<0, 6, 11, 4> has chord (6, 4)
<0, 6, 11, 8> has chord (6, 8)
<0, 6, 11, 12> has chord (6, 12)
<0, 10, 1, 14> has chord (10, 14)
<0, 10, 2, 13> has chord (10, 13)
<0, 10, 7, 14> has chord (10, 14)
<0, 11, 4, 8> has chord (4, 8)
<0, 11, 4, 2> has chord (4, 2)
<0, 11, 12, 1> has chord (12, 1)
<0, 11, 12, 5> has chord (12, 5)
<1, 10, 2, 13> has chord (10, 13)
<1, 10, 7, 14> has chord (10, 14)
<1, 12, 5, 14> has chord (5, 14)
<2, 10, 7, 14> has chord (10, 14)
<2, 13, 3, 5> has chord (3, 5)
<2, 13, 3, 11> has chord (3, 11)
<2, 13, 11, 6> has chord (13, 6)
<4, 8, 11, 6> has chord (8, 6)
<6, 0, 10, 7> has chord (0, 7)
<6, 2, 10, 7> has chord (2, 7)
<7, 9, 12, 5> has chord (9, 5)
<8, 4, 11, 6> has chord (4, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [23] chordal 4-cycles found.
