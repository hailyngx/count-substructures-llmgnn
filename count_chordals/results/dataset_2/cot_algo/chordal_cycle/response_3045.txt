Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, but we are interested in cycles of length 4 or more. 

Some of the cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-4-11-3-5
- Cycle 3: 11-4-13-7-11
- Cycle 4: 10-3-1-9-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the listed cycles:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-1-5 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 2: 5-4-11-3-5 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 3: 11-4-13-7-11 has a chord: (4, 7).
- Cycle 4: 10-3-1-9-10 has a chord: (3, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <11, (4, 7), 13, 3>
- <10, (3, 9), 1, 10>
