Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

<9, (3, 15), 20, 9>
<26, (10, 14), 4, 26>
<26, (10, 20), 15, 26>
<26, (22, 11), 23, 26>
<3, (15, 20), 10, 3>
<15, (20, 10), 14, 15>
<15, (20, 11), 22, 15>
<2, (29, 13), 27, 2>
<14, (4, 24), 5, 14>
<8, (13, 1), 7, 8>
<8, (13, 29), 2, 8>
<29, (13, 27), 7, 29>
<29, (2, 10), 26, 29>
<29, (4, 24), 21, 29>
<14, (10, 20), 11, 14>
<17, (16, 26), 10, 17>
<0, (21, 8), 13, 0>
<21, (24, 4), 27, 21>
<21, (0, 12), 29, 21>
<4, (27, 6), 7, 4>
<27, (7, 16), 26, 27>
<11, (22, 26), 16, 11>
<11, (23, 14), 10, 11>
<11, (20, 15), 3, 11>
<1, (8, 13), 29, 1>
<6, (27, 4), 14, 6>
<18, (15, 3), 20, 18>
<18, (5, 24), 4, 18>
<12, (29, 2), 10, 12>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 29 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [29].
