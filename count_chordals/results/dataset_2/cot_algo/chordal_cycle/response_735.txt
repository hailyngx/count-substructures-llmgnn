Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 0) (26, 12) (1, 21) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 25) (21, 14) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 28) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 16) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 19) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 0) (23, 22) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 25) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 13) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 20) (6, 21) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 13) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 6) (7, 18) (7, 25) (7, 5) (7, 17) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 7) (25, 12) (29, 9) (29, 24) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 2) (24, 11) (24, 29) (24, 12) (24, 5) (24, 2) (20, 8) (20, 19) (20, 14) (14, 21) (14, 20) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 22) (0, 4) (0, 13) (5, 7) (5, 24) (12, 26) (12, 25) (12, 24) (12, 13) (13, 18) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 27) (2, 24) (16, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
         There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph with all edges existing. 
         Here are some of the cycles:
         Cycle 1: 1 - 21 - 6 - 15 - 1
         Cycle 2: 3 - 15 - 6 - 21 - 3
         Cycle 3: 11 - 3 - 15 - 6 - 11
         Cycle 4: 18 - 4 - 0 - 13 - 18
         Cycle 5: 24 - 11 - 3 - 15 - 24
         Cycle 6: 27 - 22 - 0 - 18 - 27
         Cycle 7: 20 - 8 - 15 - 6 - 20
         Cycle 8: 14 - 21 - 6 - 13 - 14
         
Step 2: 
        Upon checking each cycle, we find that Cycle 3: 11 - 3 - 15 - 6 - 11 has exactly one chord (3, 6).
        
Step 3: 
        The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1].
        
Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <11, 3, 6, 15>
