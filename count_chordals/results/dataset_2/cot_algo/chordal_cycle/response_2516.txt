Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 1 - 4  
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 0 - 4  
- Cycle 3: 5 - 9 - 1 - 7  
- Cycle 4: 5 - 9 - 0 - 1  
- Cycle 5: 5 - 9 - 1 - 3  
- Cycle 6: 5 - 9 - 0 - 1  
- Cycle 7: 5 - 9 - 1 - 2  
- Cycle 8: 5 - 6 - 3 - 2  
- Cycle 9: 5 - 6 - 2 - 8  
- Cycle 10: 5 - 6 - 2 - 3  
- Cycle 11: 5 - 8 - 2 - 3  
- Cycle 12: 5 - 8 - 2 - 6  
- Cycle 13: 5 - 8 - 2 - 4  
- Cycle 14: 5 - 0 - 1 - 4  
- Cycle 15: 5 - 0 - 4 - 8  
- Cycle 16: 5 - 0 - 4 - 2  
- Cycle 17: 5 - 0 - 9 - 1  
- Cycle 18: 5 - 0 - 9 - 1  
- Cycle 19: 5 - 0 - 1 - 2  
- Cycle 20: 5 - 3 - 1 - 7  
- Cycle 21: 5 - 3 - 6 - 2  
- Cycle 22: 5 - 3 - 2 - 8  
- Cycle 23: 5 - 3 - 2 - 6  
- Cycle 24: 5 - 7 - 1 - 4  

Step 2:  
From the cycles listed above, we see that the following cycle has exactly one chord: <5, 9, 1, 4>.

Step 3:  
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph, which is <5, 9, 1, 4>.  
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].
