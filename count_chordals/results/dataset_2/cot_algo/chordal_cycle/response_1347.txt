Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 0 - 6 - 5 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 5 - 4 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 3 - 5 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 4: 2 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 5: 3 - 1 - 4 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 6: 3 - 5 - 6 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 7: 7 - 8 - 9 - 0 - 7
- Cycle 8: 9 - 3 - 7 - 8 - 9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (0, 5)
- Cycle 2 satisfies the definition of a chordal 4-cycle: <1, (0, 4), 5>
- Cycle 3 satisfies the definition of a chordal 4-cycle: <1, (5, 6), 3>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (1, 0)
- Cycle 6 satisfies the definition of a chordal 4-cycle: <3, (5, 6), 0>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (0, 9)
- Cycle 8 satisfies the definition of a chordal 4-cycle: <9, (3, 7), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [4].
