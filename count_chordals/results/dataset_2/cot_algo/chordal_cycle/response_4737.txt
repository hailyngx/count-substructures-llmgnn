Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 2) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 3) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 10, 5)
- Cycle 2: (6, 2, 10, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 3, 0, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 11, 9, 6)
- Cycle 5: (7, 8, 11, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 9, 12, 7)
- Cycle 7: (8, 1, 11, 8)
- Cycle 8: (8, 7, 12, 8)
- Cycle 9: (8, 14, 9, 8)
- Cycle 10: (9, 2, 14, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 11, 4, 9)
- Cycle 12: (9, 12, 7, 9)
- Cycle 13: (10, 2, 14, 10)
- Cycle 14: (10, 4, 11, 10)
- Cycle 15: (11, 1, 2, 11)
- Cycle 16: (11, 4, 10, 11)
- Cycle 17: (11, 8, 14, 11)
- Cycle 18: (11, 9, 6, 11)
- Cycle 19: (12, 0, 3, 12)
- Cycle 20: (12, 7, 8, 12)
- Cycle 21: (12, 9, 14, 12)
- Cycle 22: (13, 0, 3, 13)
- Cycle 23: (13, 12, 7, 13)
- Cycle 24: (13, 14, 2, 13)
- Cycle 25: (14, 2, 1, 14)
- Cycle 26: (14, 8, 11, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (5, 10), 4, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (6, 10), 9, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (0, 12), 6, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (7, 8), 11, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (8, 9), 11, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (8, 14), 9, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (0, 12), 3, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (2, 14), 1, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 18 chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [8].
