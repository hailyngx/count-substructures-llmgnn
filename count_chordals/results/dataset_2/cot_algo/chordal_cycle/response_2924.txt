Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 0) (5, 12) (5, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- Cycle 1: <6, 1, 4, 3>
- Cycle 2: <6, 1, 5, 12>
- Cycle 3: <6, 1, 2, 9>
- Cycle 4: <6, 3, 4, 7>
- Cycle 5: <6, 3, 12, 0>
- Cycle 6: <6, 12, 5, 1>
- Cycle 7: <9, 2, 10, 4>
- Cycle 8: <9, 2, 0, 12>
- Cycle 9: <9, 2, 1, 6>
- Cycle 10: <4, 1, 5, 12>
- Cycle 11: <4, 1, 6, 7>
- Cycle 12: <4, 3, 13, 0>
- Cycle 13: <4, 3, 6, 1>
- Cycle 14: <4, 7, 0, 13>
- Cycle 15: <4, 7, 11, 10>
- Cycle 16: <4, 10, 8, 11>
- Cycle 17: <4, 10, 13, 3>
- Cycle 18: <7, 6, 3, 4>
- Cycle 19: <7, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 20: <7, 0, 13, 3>
- Cycle 21: <7, 11, 10, 4>
- Cycle 22: <8, 9, 2, 10>
- Cycle 23: <8, 9, 11, 7>
- Cycle 24: <8, 11, 10, 4>
- Cycle 25: <13, 0, 12, 6>
- Cycle 26: <13, 0, 2, 9>
- Cycle 27: <13, 3, 4, 7>
- Cycle 28: <13, 10, 4, 7>
- Cycle 29: <5, 1, 6, 12>
- Cycle 30: <5, 12, 0, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:  
- None of the cycles contain exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:  
- There are 30 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [30].
