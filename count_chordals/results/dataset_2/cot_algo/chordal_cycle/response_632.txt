Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 7, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (3, 5, 4, 7, 3)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord (7, 1): <Cycle 1, (1, 7)>
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 5): <Cycle 2, (4, 5)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. Since both cycles have chords, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
