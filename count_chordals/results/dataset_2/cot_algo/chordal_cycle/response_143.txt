Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        There are several cycles in the graph: 
        Cycle 1: 7-4-1-12-7
        Cycle 2: 10-4-1-14-10
        Cycle 3: 10-7-13-6-10
        Cycle 4: 2-5-3-6-2
        Cycle 5: 2-5-12-1-2
        Cycle 6: 13-7-4-10-13
        Cycle 7: 13-8-2-0-13
        Cycle 8: 6-13-0-2-6
        Cycle 9: 6-13-7-4-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        Out of the cycles above, Cycle 6: 13-7-4-10-13 has exactly one chord: (4, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the graph.

Putting it all together, we have: [1]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <<13, 7, 10, 4>> with a chord (4, 10).
