Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle: 0-1-5-6-0
        - Cycle: 0-1-2-9-0
        - Cycle: 0-1-2-7-0
        - Cycle: 0-1-2-4-0
        - Cycle: 0-1-3-4-0
        - Cycle: 0-6-7-4-0
        - Cycle: 0-6-5-4-0
        - Cycle: 0-6-9-4-0
        - Cycle: 0-9-2-7-0
        - Cycle: 0-9-2-4-0
        - Cycle: 1-2-9-4-1
        - Cycle: 1-2-7-4-1
        - Cycle: 1-2-7-8-1
        - Cycle: 1-2-4-5-1
        - Cycle: 2-9-4-7-2
        - Cycle: 2-9-4-3-2
        - Cycle: 2-9-4-8-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0, (6, 4), 7>
        - <0, (1, 9), 2>
        - <0, (2, 7), 1>
        - <0, (2, 4), 1>
        - <0, (1, 3), 4>
        - <6, (7, 4), 0>
        - <6, (7, 5), 4>
        - <6, (9, 4), 0>
        - <0, (9, 7), 2>
        - <0, (9, 4), 2>
        - <1, (2, 4), 9>
        - <1, (2, 4), 7>
        - <1, (2, 8), 7>
        - <1, (4, 5), 2>
        - <2, (4, 7), 9>
        - <2, (4, 3), 9>
        - <2, (4, 8), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
