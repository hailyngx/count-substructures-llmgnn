Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 13) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 13) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 0, 10) with edges (4, 7), (7, 0), (0, 10), (10, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 2, 1, 8) with edges (4, 2), (2, 1), (1, 8), (8, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 11, 6, 12) with edges (4, 11), (11, 6), (6, 12), (12, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 14, 3, 5) with edges (4, 14), (14, 3), (3, 5), (5, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 2, 6, 11) with edges (7, 2), (2, 6), (6, 11), (11, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 0, 13, 10) with edges (7, 0), (0, 13), (13, 10), (10, 7)
- Cycle 7: (8, 1, 2, 4) with edges (8, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 8)
- Cycle 8: (8, 12, 6, 2) with edges (8, 12), (12, 6), (6, 2), (2, 8)
- Cycle 9: (9, 13, 0, 7) with edges (9, 13), (13, 0), (0, 7), (7, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 8, 12, 6) with edges (9, 8), (8, 12), (12, 6), (6, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 14, 4, 8) with edges (9, 14), (14, 4), (4, 8), (8, 9)
- Cycle 12: (13, 1, 8, 12) with edges (13, 1), (1, 8), (8, 12), (12, 13)
- Cycle 13: (13, 10, 0, 7) with edges (13, 10), (10, 0), (0, 7), (7, 13)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (2, 4), 8>
- <10, (0, 7), 13>
- <11, (4, 6), 12>
- <14, (4, 8), 9>
- <2, (1, 8), 4>
- <12, (6, 8), 9>
- <13, (0, 12), 10>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
