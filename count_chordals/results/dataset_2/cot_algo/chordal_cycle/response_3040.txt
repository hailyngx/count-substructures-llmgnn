Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 6) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 9) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 14) (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 28) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 0) (23, 26) (23, 18) (23, 4) (17, 29) (17, 0) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 12) (0, 8) (0, 17) (14, 21) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 14) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 15) (20, 11) (20, 27) (20, 5) (10, 21) (10, 22) (10, 15) (10, 27) (15, 11) (15, 22) (15, 10) (15, 13) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 28) (26, 23) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 25) (4, 23) (4, 2) (27, 29) (27, 20) (27, 10) (27, 28) (18, 23) (18, 12) (18, 25) (18, 13) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 2) (28, 7) (28, 2) (28, 27) (28, 19) (12, 29) (12, 24) (12, 18) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 20) (25, 24) (25, 18) (19, 7) (19, 28) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-21-7-29-1
- Cycle 2: 1-9-14-21-1
- Cycle 3: 1-9-14-6-16-11-15-13-3-5-20-27-10-22-2-4-23-26-18-13-15-10-27-20-5-22-10-21-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-14-6-16-11-15-13-3-5-22-2-4-23-26-18-13-15-10-21-7-29-1
- Cycle 5: 1-9-14-6-16-11-15-13-3-5-22-2-4-23-26-18-13-15-10-27-29-17-0-8-21-1
- Cycle 6: 1-9-14-6-16-11-15-13-3-5-20-27-10-22-2-4-23-26-18-13-15-10-21-7-29-17-0-8-21-1
- Cycle 7: 1-21-7-29-17-0-8-21-14-9-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (9, 21)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 21)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (1, 29)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (1, 21)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (1, 29)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 7, 21, 29, 1>
- <1, 9, 14, 21, 1>
- <1, 21, 7, 29, 17, 0, 8, 21, 14, 9, 1>
- <1, 21, 7, 29, 17, 0, 8, 21, 1>
- <1, 21, 14, 6, 16, 11, 15, 13, 3, 5, 20, 27, 10, 22, 2, 4, 23, 26, 18, 13, 15, 10, 21, 7, 29, 17, 0, 8, 21, 1>
- <1, 9, 14, 6, 16, 11, 15, 13, 3, 5, 22, 2, 4, 23, 26, 18, 13, 15, 10, 21, 7, 29, 1>
- <1, 9, 14, 6, 16, 11, 15, 13, 3, 5, 20, 27, 10, 22, 2, 4, 23, 26, 18, 13, 15, 10, 21, 7, 29, 17, 0, 8, 21, 1>
