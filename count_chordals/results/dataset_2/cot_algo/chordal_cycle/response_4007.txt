Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 12) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 1) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) 

Response:
With the provided information, let's follow the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, but we are interested in cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 13, 5)
- Cycle 2: (8, 9, 1, 13, 8)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 11, 12, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 11, 12, 7)
- Cycle 5: (4, 11, 12, 7, 13)
- Cycle 6: (14, 9, 1, 12, 14)
- Cycle 7: (14, 9, 1, 2, 14)
- Cycle 8: (14, 9, 1, 12, 3)
- Cycle 9: (14, 4, 11, 12, 14)
- Cycle 10: (14, 4, 11, 12, 7)
- Cycle 11: (14, 0, 10, 2, 14)
- Cycle 12: (14, 0, 6, 3, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the listed cycles, the following chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are found:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (9, 13), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <8, (9, 13), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (8, 12), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (8, 12), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, (11, 12), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <14, (9, 1), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <14, (9, 1), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <14, (4, 12), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <14, (4, 12), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <14, (0, 10), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <14, (0, 6), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
