Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-3-1
- Cycle 2: 2-7-5-2
- Cycle 3: 6-7-5-6
- Cycle 4: 8-3-4-9
- Cycle 5: 8-3-1-5
- Cycle 6: 9-4-1-0
- Cycle 7: 9-4-3-8
- Cycle 8: 9-4-1-3
- Cycle 9: 9-8-6-2
- Cycle 10: 9-2-5-7
- Cycle 11: 9-2-6-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
From the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <9, (4, 1), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
