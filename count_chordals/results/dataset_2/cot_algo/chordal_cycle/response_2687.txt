Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 0-6-9-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-6-8-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-8-7-3-0
- Cycle 4: 2-6-8-4-2
- Cycle 5: 2-6-5-4-2
- Cycle 6: 2-6-0-8-2
- Cycle 7: 2-6-5-1-2
- Cycle 8: 2-6-0-3-2
- Cycle 9: 2-5-4-8-2
- Cycle 10: 2-5-6-1-2
- Cycle 11: 2-5-6-0-2

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has no chord.
- Cycle 8 has no chord.
- Cycle 9 has chord <2, 8>.
- Cycle 10 has chord <1, 5>.
- Cycle 11 has chord <0, 6>.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 6, 9, 1, 0> (Chord: <1, 5>)
- <0, 6, 8, 4, 0> (No chord)
- <2, 6, 8, 4, 2> (No chord)
