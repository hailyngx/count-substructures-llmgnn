Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0-8-13-10-11-4-3-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-8-1-2-3-4-11-0
- Cycle 3: 0-8-1-2-10-11-4-3-7-0
- Cycle 4: 0-8-1-2-10-13-7-0
- Cycle 5: 0-11-10-2-3-7-0
- Cycle 6: 2-10-13-8-1-9-14-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 8, 13, 10>
- <0, 8, 1, 2>
- <0, 8, 1, 2>
- <0, 8, 1, 2>
- <0, 11, 4, 3>
- <2, 10, 13, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [6].
