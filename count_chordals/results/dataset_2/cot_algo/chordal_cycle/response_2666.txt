Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
    - Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 4, 0>
    - Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 3, 0>
    - Cycle 3: <1, 5, 8, 2, 1>
    - Cycle 4: <1, 9, 6, 3, 1>
    - Cycle 5: <3, 7, 8, 2, 3>

Step 2:
    - <0, 5, 1, 4, 0> has a chord (1, 4)
    - <0, 5, 8, 3, 0> has a chord (5, 3)
    - <1, 5, 8, 2, 1> has a chord (5, 8)
    - <1, 9, 6, 3, 1> has a chord (9, 6)
    - <3, 7, 8, 2, 3> has a chord (7, 8)

Step 3:
    The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
