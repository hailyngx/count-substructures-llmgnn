Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1-5-9-7-4-1-6 with edges (1, 5), (5, 9), (9, 7), (7, 4), (4, 1), (1, 6), (6, 5).
2. Cycle 1-6-8-4-7-3-2 with edges (1, 6), (6, 8), (8, 4), (4, 7), (7, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1).
3. Cycle 0-5-6-4-8-7-3 with edges (0, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (4, 8), (8, 7), (7, 3), (3, 0).
4. Cycle 2-3-7-4-8-6-1 with edges (2, 3), (3, 7), (7, 4), (4, 8), (8, 6), (6, 1), (1, 2).

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle 1-5-9-7-4-1-6 has a chord (7, 1).
2. Cycle 1-6-8-4-7-3-2 has a chord (8, 3).
3. Cycle 0-5-6-4-8-7-3 has a chord (8, 5).
4. Cycle 2-3-7-4-8-6-1 has a chord (8, 3).

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 0.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
