Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 9) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 3) (19, 2) (19, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 16) (12, 3) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 10) (3, 18) (3, 12) (17, 5) (17, 0) (17, 8) (14, 18) (14, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 1) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 14) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 15) (13, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 12, 3, 18, 9, 0, 15, 13, 19, 2, 6, 7, 11)
- Cycle 2: (5, 6, 2, 19, 13, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 7, 11, 16, 0, 15, 13, 19, 2, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (12, 3)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (19, 4)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (7, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Based on the chords found in each cycle, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- Cycle 1: <11, 16, 12, 3>
- Cycle 2: <5, 6, 2, 19>
- Cycle 3: <5, 6, 7, 11>
