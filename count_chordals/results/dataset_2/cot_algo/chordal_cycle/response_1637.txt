Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 1, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 6, 0, 4, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 3, 6, 9, 1, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 3, 1, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 3, 0, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 4, 7, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 4, 0, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 4, 9, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 11: (5, 4, 0, 6, 3, 5)

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 1, 7, 4, 5) <(1, 7)>
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 6, 0, 4, 5) <(6, 0)>
- Cycle 6: (5, 3, 1, 7, 4, 5) <(1, 7)>
- Cycle 8: (5, 4, 7, 1, 9, 5) <(7, 1)>
- Cycle 9: (5, 4, 0, 6, 9, 5) <(0, 6)>
- Cycle 10: (5, 4, 9, 1, 7, 5) <(9, 1)>

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, 7, 4, 5>
- <6, 0, 4, 5>
- <1, 7, 4, 5>
- <7, 1, 9, 5>
- <0, 6, 9, 5>
- <9, 1, 7, 5>
