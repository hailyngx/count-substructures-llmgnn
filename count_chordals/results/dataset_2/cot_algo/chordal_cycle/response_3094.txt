Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 19) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 17) (6, 18) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 17) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 15) (4, 9) (4, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (15, 14) (15, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (19, 3) (19, 16) (17, 18) (17, 11) (17, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-1-5 with 4 edges
- Cycle 2: 5-9-12-13-3-5 with 5 edges
- Cycle 3: 5-2-3-7-16-1-5 with 6 edges
- Cycle 4: 8-0-5-9-12-14-8 with 6 edges 
- Cycle 5: 8-0-15-14-12-13-3-8 with 7 edges
- Cycle 6: 18-2-3-13-12-14-15-0-8-18 with 9 edges
- Cycle 7: 18-2-7-16-1-10-9-5-0-15-8-18 with 11 edges
- Cycle 8: 11-3-13-12-14-8-0-15-11 with 8 edges
- Cycle 9: 16-1-10-9-12-13-3-11-17-7-16 with 10 edges

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, (4, 1), 5> has 1 chord (4, 1)
- <5, 9, 12, 13, 3, 5> does not have exactly one chord
- <5, 2, 3, 7, 16, 1, 5> does not have exactly one chord
- <8, 0, 5, 9, 12, 14, 8> does not have exactly one chord
- <8, 0, 15, 14, 12, 13, 3, 8> does not have exactly one chord
- <18, 2, (3, 13), 12, 14, 15, 0, 8, 18> has 1 chord (3, 13)
- <18, 2, 7, 16, 1, 10, 9, 5, 0, 15, 8, 18> does not have exactly one chord
- <11, 3, 13, 12, 14, 8, 0, 15, 11> does not have exactly one chord
- <16, 1, 10, 9, 12, 13, 3, 11, 17, 7, 16> does not have exactly one chord

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Chordal 4-cycle found:
1. <5, 9, (4, 1), 5>
2. <18, 2, (3, 13), 12, 14, 15, 0, 8, 18>
