Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 10 - 1 - 0 - 11 - 10
- Cycle 2: 10 - 5 - 7 - 11 - 10
- Cycle 3: 10 - 5 - 12 - 8 - 1 - 0 - 11 - 7 - 6 - 3 - 9 - 10
- Cycle 4: 10 - 5 - 13 - 14 - 2 - 4 - 12 - 8 - 1 - 0 - 11 - 7 - 6 - 3 - 9 - 10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 11)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 11)
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (11, 5), 0, 10>
<11, (5, 13), 14, 2>
