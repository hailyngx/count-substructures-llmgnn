- Cycle 40: (13, 6, 5, 17)
- Cycle 41: (14, 16, 18, 11)
- Cycle 42: (14, 16, 2, 0)
- Cycle 43: (15, 8, 5, 17)
- Cycle 44: (15, 8, 12, 18)
- Cycle 45: (16, 14, 19, 1)
- Cycle 46: (16, 2, 0, 13)
- Cycle 47: (16, 2, 7, 15)

- Cycle 54: (19, 1, 15, 7)
- Cycle 55: (19, 1, 15, 8)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <Cycle 30, (4, 13)>
- <Cycle 34, (4, 13)>
- <Cycle 27, (6, 13)>
- <Cycle 28, (6, 13)>
- <Cycle 23, (8, 12)>
- <Cycle 24, (8, 12)>
- <Cycle 38, (0, 2)>
- <Cycle 42, (0, 2)>
- <Cycle 46, (0, 13)>
- <Cycle 39, (4, 8)>
- <Cycle 50, (9, 4)>
- <Cycle 40, (5, 17)>
- <Cycle 45, (14, 19)>
- <Cycle 47, (2, 16)>
- <Cycle 51, (18, 11)>

Step 3:
There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [15].
