Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 0, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 7, 0, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has two chords: (6, 0) and (1, 5)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
