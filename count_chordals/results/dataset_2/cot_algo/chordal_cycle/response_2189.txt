Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 16) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (17, 19) (17, 18) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 19) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 19) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 10) (15, 2) (15, 16) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 13) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 18) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 3) (18, 10) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 3) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

- Cycle 1: (5, 12, 6, 8, 3, 7, 11, 14, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 4, 0, 19, 17, 11, 14, 12, 9)
- Cycle 3: (14, 12, 6, 13, 11, 17, 19, 0, 4, 9, 16, 2, 15, 16, 1, 10, 8, 6, 14)
- Cycle 4: (17, 19, 0, 4, 9, 16, 15, 2, 1, 10, 8, 3, 7, 11, 13, 6, 12, 14, 17)
- Cycle 5: (4, 9, 16, 1, 2, 15, 16, 9)
- Cycle 6: (8, 6, 13, 11, 7, 19, 17, 18, 10, 1, 2, 16, 9, 4, 0, 19, 3, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has the chord (6, 14).
- Cycle 4 has the chord (4, 16).
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has the chord (6, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 2 chordal 4-cycles in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are <5, 12, 6, 8, (3, 7), 11, 14> and <9, 4, 0, 19, 17, 11, 14, 12>.
