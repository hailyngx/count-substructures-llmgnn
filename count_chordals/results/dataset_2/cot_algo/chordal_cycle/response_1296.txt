Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 in the graph are: (1, 7, 5, 4), (1, 5, 2, 3), (6, 8, 7, 1), (3, 8, 2, 5), (1, 9, 6, 5), (4, 7, 5, 6), (1, 8, 3, 0), (6, 9, 1, 7), (4, 3, 0, 5), (7, 8, 3, 6).

Step 2: 
- Among these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle with one chord is <1, 7, 5, 4>, where the chord is (1, 5).

Step 3:
- Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
