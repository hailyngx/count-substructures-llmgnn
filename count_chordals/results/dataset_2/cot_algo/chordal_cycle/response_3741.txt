Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 23) (5, 10) (9, 18) (9, 2) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 8) (15, 1) (15, 26) (18, 9) (18, 26) (18, 0) (18, 29) (22, 14) (22, 11) (22, 24) (22, 1) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 10) (27, 12) (27, 29) (0, 18) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 19) (20, 3) (20, 0) (20, 7) (20, 13) (6, 28) (6, 16) (28, 6) (28, 14) (28, 2) (13, 20) (13, 4) (13, 11) (26, 15) (26, 18) (26, 25) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 25) (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 19) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 21) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (29, 18) (29, 27) (29, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 23) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 8) (23, 5) (23, 2) (23, 10) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 7) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 14) (21, 8) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 25) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 23) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 29) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <5, 2, 28, 6>
2. Cycle <5, 2, 23, 10>
3. Cycle <9, 18, 26, 15>
4. Cycle <3, 17, 7, 20>
5. Cycle <12, 27, 29, 11>
6. Cycle <0, 18, 29, 27>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle <5, 2, 28, 6> has chord (5, 6)
2. Cycle <5, 2, 23, 10> has chord (5, 23)
3. Cycle <9, 18, 26, 15> has chord (9, 26) 
4. Cycle <3, 17, 7, 20> has chord (3, 7)
5. Cycle <12, 27, 29, 11> does not have exactly one chord
6. Cycle <0, 18, 29, 27> does not have exactly one chord

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, (23, 2), 10>
<9, (26, 18), 15>
<3, (7, 17), 20>
<5, (6, 2), 28>
