Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (15, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (17, 19) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (16, 4) (16, 6) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 12) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 12) (1, 10) (1, 18) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 13) (4, 3) (4, 16) (4, 9) (4, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) (6, 16) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:  
1. Cycle <3, 5, 11, 12>  
2. Cycle <2, 6, 16, 4>  
3. Cycle <4, 16, 6, 2>  
4. Cycle <10, 11, 12, 18>  
5. Cycle <10, 1, 18, 6>  
6. Cycle <0, 6, 2, 14>  
7. Cycle <4, 16, 6, 0>  
8. Cycle <8, 12, 11, 10>  
9. Cycle <15, 3, 5, 11>  
10. Cycle <19, 12, 11, 5>  

Step 2:  
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:  
1. Cycle <3, 5, 11, 12> has chord (5, 12)  
2. Cycle <2, 6, 16, 4> has chord (6, 16)  
3. Cycle <4, 16, 6, 2> has chord (6, 16)  
4. Cycle <10, 11, 12, 18> has chord (11, 18)  
5. Cycle <10, 1, 18, 6> has chord (1, 18)  
6. Cycle <0, 6, 2, 14> has chord (6, 14)  
7. Cycle <4, 16, 6, 0> has chord (4, 6)  
8. Cycle <8, 12, 11, 10> has chord (12, 10)  
9. Cycle <15, 3, 5, 11> has chord (3, 11)  
10. Cycle <19, 12, 11, 5> has chord (12, 5)  

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have a total of [10].  
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:  
1. <3, 5, 11, 12>  
2. <2, 6, 16, 4>  
3. <4, 16, 6, 2>  
4. <10, 11, 12, 18>  
5. <10, 1, 18, 6>  
6. <0, 6, 2, 14>  
7. <4, 16, 6, 0>  
8. <8, 12, 11, 10>  
9. <15, 3, 5, 11>  
10. <19, 12, 11, 5>
