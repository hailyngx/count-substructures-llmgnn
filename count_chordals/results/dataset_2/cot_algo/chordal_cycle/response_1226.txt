Step 2:  
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 8, 10> (Chord: (9, 8))
- <5, 29, 11, 1> (Chord: (29, 11))
- <5, 7, 18, 8> (Chord: (18, 7))
- <22, 23, 12, 16> (Chord: (23, 12))
- <0, 20, 10, 1> (Chord: (20, 10))
  
Step 3:  
Number of chordless cycles found = 51 - 5 = 46  
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [46].
