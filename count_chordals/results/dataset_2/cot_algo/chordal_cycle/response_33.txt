Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 4) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 2) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 1) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 7, 12, 6) with edges (0, 7), (7, 12), (12, 6), (6, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 7, 3, 9) with edges (0, 7), (7, 3), (3, 9), (9, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 11, 4, 0) with edges (1, 11), (11, 4), (4, 0), (0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 11, 7, 12) with edges (1, 11), (11, 7), (7, 12), (12, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 12, 7, 0) with edges (1, 12), (12, 7), (7, 0), (0, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 12, 6, 2) with edges (1, 12), (12, 6), (6, 2), (2, 1)
- Cycle 7: (3, 10, 13, 4) with edges (3, 10), (10, 13), (13, 4), (4, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 9, 1, 12) with edges (3, 9), (9, 1), (1, 12), (12, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (7, 12)
- Cycle 2 has chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 3 has chord (11, 4)
- Cycle 4 has chord (11, 7)
- Cycle 5 has chord (12, 7)
- Cycle 6 has chord (12, 6)
- Cycle 7 has chord (10, 13)
- Cycle 8 has chord (1, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- A total of 8 chordal 4-cycles were found.

Therefore, the count inside brackets is [8].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 7, 12, 6>
<0, 7, 3, 9>
<1, 11, 4, 0>
<1, 11, 7, 12>
<1, 12, 7, 0>
<1, 12, 6, 2>
<3, 10, 13, 4>
<3, 9, 1, 12>
