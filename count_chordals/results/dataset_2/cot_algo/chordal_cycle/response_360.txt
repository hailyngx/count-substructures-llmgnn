Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 20) (3, 25) (3, 12) (3, 22) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 13) (25, 24) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 16) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 23) (29, 9) (29, 28) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 1) (7, 10) (7, 0) (13, 25) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 24) (14, 8) (14, 1) (26, 10) (26, 21) (19, 22) (19, 2) (19, 23) (22, 3) (22, 19) (22, 27) (18, 3) (18, 8) (24, 25) (24, 13) (1, 25) (1, 28) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 4) (2, 15) (4, 2) (4, 23) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 13) (20, 9) (20, 27) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 27) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 27) (21, 23) (27, 22) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 21) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 23) (23, 28) (23, 19) (23, 4) (23, 21) (23, 15) (12, 3) (12, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 29, 28, 1, 25, 13, 17, 16, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 29, 28, 1, 25, 3, 22, 19, 2, 11, 28, 12, 3, 18, 8, 14, 1, 25, 13, 17, 16, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 15, 2, 11, 28, 29, 9, 20, 27, 22, 3, 12, 28, 1, 14, 8, 18, 3, 25, 13, 17, 16, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has the chord (9, 28).
- Cycle 2 has the chord (25, 2).
- Cycle 3 has the chord (28, 12).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, which are <1, (9, 28), 5)>, <2, (25, 2), 5)>, and <3, (28, 12), 5)>.

Therefore, the final number of chordless 4-cycles is [0].
