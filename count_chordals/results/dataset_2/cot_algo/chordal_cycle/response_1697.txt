Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 8) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (3, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <0, 4, 7, 2, 1>
2. Cycle <0, 4, 11, 10, 7>
3. Cycle <0, 4, 12, 8, 14>
4. Cycle <0, 10, 6, 5, 1>
5. Cycle <1, 2, 4, 7, 10>
6. Cycle <1, 2, 12, 8, 14>
7. Cycle <1, 5, 6, 10, 7>
8. Cycle <2, 4, 7, 10, 11>
9. Cycle <2, 4, 12, 8, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Cycle <0, 4, 7, 2, 1> has a chord (4, 1)
2. Cycle <0, 4, 12, 8, 14> has a chord (4, 8)
3. Cycle <1, 2, 4, 7, 10> has a chord (2, 7)
4. Cycle <1, 2, 12, 8, 14> has a chord (2, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [5]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are <0, 4, 7, (1, 2), 10> and <1, (2, 8), 14>.
