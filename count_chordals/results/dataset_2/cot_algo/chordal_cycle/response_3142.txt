Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 21) (1, 14) (1, 24) (1, 23) (1, 27) (21, 22) (21, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 17) (12, 11) (12, 27) (27, 1) (27, 12) (5, 6) (5, 26) (6, 21) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 24) (19, 25) (19, 24) (26, 5) (26, 2) (17, 11) (17, 29) (17, 8) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 18) (28, 13) (28, 3) (28, 7) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 4) (8, 17) (8, 9) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 20) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 18) (3, 6) (3, 28) (3, 23) (18, 29) (18, 15) (18, 16) (25, 19) (25, 29) (2, 22) (2, 6) (2, 26) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 10) (7, 28) (7, 15) (7, 23) (20, 9) (23, 13) (23, 1) (23, 3) (23, 7) (24, 1) (24, 14) (24, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: In this graph, we need to list all cycles of length 4 or more. 

Some of the cycles present in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (13, 22, 2, 6, 5, 26, 2) with 6 edges
- Cycle 2: (13, 22, 4, 15, 18, 16, 0, 10, 9, 13) with 9 edges
- Cycle 3: (23, 7, 28, 13, 22, 2, 6, 3, 23) with 8 edges
- Cycle 4: (1, 27, 12, 11, 17, 8, 9, 10, 0, 1) with 9 edges
- Cycle 5: (25, 29, 17, 11, 10, 0, 14, 24, 19, 25) with 9 edges

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the cycles listed above, only Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 have exactly one chord. 
- For Cycle 1, the chord is (5, 26)
- For Cycle 3, the chord is (6, 28)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are <1, (5, 26), 6, 2)> and <3, (6, 28), 23>.
