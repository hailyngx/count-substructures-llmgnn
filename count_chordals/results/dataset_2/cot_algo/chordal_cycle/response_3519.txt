Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 26) (2, 18) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 5) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 23) (11, 24) (11, 0) (4, 7) (4, 24) (7, 29) (7, 4) (7, 23) (18, 2) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 24) (22, 6) (22, 8) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 26) (24, 11) (24, 4) (24, 15) (24, 0) (5, 29) (5, 28) (5, 3) (23, 10) (23, 7) (23, 3) (23, 20) (9, 25) (9, 12) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 21) (0, 11) (0, 24) (0, 28) (0, 19) (28, 14) (28, 5) (28, 0) (28, 1) (16, 13) (27, 14) (27, 29) (27, 10) (27, 21) (27, 3) (21, 25) (21, 27) (21, 12) (13, 16) (13, 20) (13, 1) (13, 19) (1, 28) (1, 13) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 13) (20, 23) (20, 13) (8, 15) (8, 22) (8, 26) (3, 5) (3, 23) (3, 27) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 21) (26, 17) (26, 6) (26, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (10, 15, 24, 11)
- Cycle 2: (23, 20, 13, 1)
- Cycle 3: (15, 24, 4, 7)
- Cycle 4: (19, 6, 22, 8)
- Cycle 5: (19, 25, 21, 27)
- Cycle 6: (24, 0, 11, 24)
- Cycle 7: (5, 29, 27, 14)
- Cycle 8: (12, 6, 22, 8)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (15, 11)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (20, 1)
- Cycle 3 doesn't have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (6, 22)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (25, 21)
- Cycle 6 doesn't have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 7 doesn't have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (6, 22)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- We found 3 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <10, 15, 24, 11> with chord (15, 11)
2. <23, 20, 13, 1> with chord (20, 1)
3. <19, 6, 22, 8> with chord (6, 22)
