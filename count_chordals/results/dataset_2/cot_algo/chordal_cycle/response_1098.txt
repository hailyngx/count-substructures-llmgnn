Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 6) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 10) (7, 8) (7, 19) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 15) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 0) (0, 18) (2, 4) (2, 6) (5, 14) (5, 12) (16, 10) (16, 9) (16, 6) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 6) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 16) (9, 15) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 

- One cycle of length 4 is <1, 10, 16, 9>.
- Another cycle of length 4 is <1, 13, 8, 11>.
- Yet another cycle of length 4 is <3, 11, 10, 16>.
- One more cycle of length 4 is <4, 18, 8, 13>.
- Additionally, cycle <4, 2, 6, 16> can also be found in the graph.
- Lastly, <6, 3, 11, 10> is another cycle of length 4.

Step 2:

For each of the cycles listed above, we need to check for the presence of exactly one chord. 

- <1, 10, 16, 9> does not have any chords.
- <1, 13, 8, 11> does have a chord: (13, 8).
- <3, 11, 10, 16> does not have any chords.
- <4, 18, 8, 13> does have a chord: (4, 13).
- <4, 2, 6, 16> does have a chord: (2, 6).
- <6, 3, 11, 10> does not have any chords.

Step 3:

There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph based on the presence of exactly one chord. Therefore, the final count is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1, 13, 8, 11> (Chord: (13, 8))
2. <4, 18, 8, 13> (Chord: (4, 13))
3. <4, 2, 6, 16> (Chord: (2, 6))
