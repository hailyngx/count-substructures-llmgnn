Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 16) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 14) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 13) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 7) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 10) (18, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 19) (11, 5) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 16) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 16) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 0) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 16) (16, 6) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 9, 14, 19, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 9, 14, 17, 6, 16, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 13, 8, 14, 17, 6, 16, 15, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 8, 14, 17, 6, 16, 15, 1, 7, 5, 11, 2)
- Cycle 5: (3, 9, 14, 17, 6, 16, 0, 19, 2, 8, 13, 3)
- Cycle 6: (4, 5, 7, 1, 13, 8, 14, 9, 0, 19, 2, 10, 18, 4)
- Cycle 7: (5, 7, 1, 13, 8, 9, 0, 16, 6, 17, 14, 8, 13, 15, 16, 12, 4)
- Cycle 8: (6, 16, 15, 13, 3, 9, 0, 19, 14, 17)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (14, 19)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (14, 17)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (8, 14)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (14, 17)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (14, 17)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (8, 13)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (1, 13)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (13, 3)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 9, 14, 19, 0> with chord (14, 19)
- <0, 9, 14, 17, 6, 16, 0> with chord (14, 17)
- <1, 13, 8, 14, 17, 6, 16, 15, 1> with chord (8, 14)
- <2, 8, 14, 17, 6, 16, 15, 1, 7, 5, 11, 2> with chord (14, 17)
- <3, 9, 14, 17, 6, 16, 0, 19, 2, 8, 13, 3> with chord (14, 17)
- <4, 5, 7, 1, 13, 8, 14, 9, 0, 19, 2, 10, 18, 4> with chord (8, 13)
- <5, 7, 1, 13, 8, 9, 0, 16, 6, 17, 14, 8, 13, 15, 16, 12, 4> with chord (1, 13)
- <6, 16, 15, 13, 3, 9, 0, 19, 14, 17> with chord (13, 3)
