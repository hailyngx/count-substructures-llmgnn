Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 10) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 12) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Possible cycles with 4 or more nodes: 
- Cycle 1: 1-9-3-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-9-3-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-8-7-4-1
- Cycle 4: 1-8-7-5-1
- Cycle 5: 1-8-0-7-1
- Cycle 6: 1-13-2-5-1
- Cycle 7: 1-13-11-12-1
- Cycle 8: 4-7-5-2-4
- Cycle 9: 4-7-5-11-4
- Cycle 10: 4-7-14-0-4
- Cycle 11: 4-7-14-5-4
- Cycle 12: 4-10-3-9-4
- Cycle 13: 4-10-12-11-4
- Cycle 14: 7-8-3-10-7
- Cycle 15: 7-8-13-11-7
- Cycle 16: 7-5-2-13-7
- Cycle 17: 7-4-1-8-7
- Cycle 18: 7-0-14-5-7
- Cycle 19: 7-14-0-12-7
- Cycle 20: 7-14-13-2-7
- Cycle 21: 0-8-3-9-0
- Cycle 22: 0-8-1-4-0
- Cycle 23: 0-8-7-5-0
- Cycle 24: 0-12-11-13-0
- Cycle 25: 0-12-10-4-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordless cycles found:
- Cycle 2: 1-9-3-8-1
- Cycle 6: 1-13-2-5-1
- Cycle 13: 4-10-12-11-4

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Three chordless cycles found, so the final number is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
- <1, 9, 3, 8, 1>
- <1, 13, 2, 5, 1>
- <4, 10, 12, 11, 4>
