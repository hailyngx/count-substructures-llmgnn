Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (8, 11) (8, 12) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 14) (2, 15) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 19) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 15) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 0) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 15) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 15) (13, 9) (13, 16) (13, 18) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 18) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 11) (11, 8) (11, 18) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 16) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<0, 4, 7, 6>
<0, 4, 7, 5>
<0, 4, 7, 6, 14>
<0, 4, 7, 6, 17>
<0, 4, 7, 6, 14, 9>
<0, 4, 7, 5, 15>
<0, 4, 7, 5, 15, 2>
<0, 4, 7, 6, 17, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

<0, 4, 7, 6> has a chord (0, 7)
<0, 4, 7, 5> has a chord (4, 5)
<0, 4, 7, 6, 14> has a chord (4, 14)
<0, 4, 7, 6, 17> has a chord (4, 17)
<0, 4, 7, 6, 17, 3> has a chord (6, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 2 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final count is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycle is: <0, 4, 7, 6> <0, 7> & <4, 7>
