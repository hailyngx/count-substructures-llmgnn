Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-7-3-5
- Cycle 2: 9-5-6-1-9
- Cycle 3: 4-8-6-5-4
- Cycle 4: 9-2-6-8-9
- Cycle 5: 5-1-6-2-5
- Cycle 6: 5-1-7-2-5
- Cycle 7: 5-1-4-8-5
- Cycle 8: 9-8-6-2-9
- Cycle 9: 5-9-7-1-5
- Cycle 10: 5-9-2-6-5
- Cycle 11: 9-8-2-7-9
- Cycle 12: 5-0-4-1-5
- Cycle 13: 5-1-2-8-5
- Cycle 14: 5-0-8-6-5
- Cycle 15: 9-7-1-4-9
- Cycle 16: 9-7-2-6-9
- Cycle 17: 4-0-3-7-4
- Cycle 18: 4-0-8-2-4

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: <2, 8>.
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: <9, 5>.
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: <1, 5>.
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord: <9, 6>.
- Cycle 10 has exactly one chord: <6, 9>.
- Cycle 13 has exactly one chord: <1, 5>.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Total chordal 4-cycles = 6 => [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <9, 5, 6, 1>
- <9, 6, 8, 2>
- <1, 5, 6, 2>
- <5, 1, 7, 3>
- <1, 5, 4, 8>
- <5, 0, 4, 1>
