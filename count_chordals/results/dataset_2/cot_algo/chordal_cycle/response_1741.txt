Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 17) (4, 11) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 14) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 8) (7, 5) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 6) (19, 1) (19, 2) (9, 15) (9, 17) (12, 15) (12, 13) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (14, 2) (14, 5) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-1-10-15 (Chord: (3, 15))
- Cycle 2: 3-6-2-18 (Chord: (3, 18))
- Cycle 3: 3-18-17-16 (Chord: (3, 16))
- Cycle 4: 3-1-19-2 (Chord: (3, 2))
- Cycle 5: 15-10-1-3 (Chord: (15, 1))
- Cycle 6: 15-18-17-16 (Chord: (15, 16))
- Cycle 7: 15-12-13-11 (Chord: (15, 13))
- Cycle 8: 1-10-8-2 (Chord: (1, 8))
- Cycle 9: 13-12-15-10 (Chord: (13, 10))
- Cycle 10: 2-8-10-15 (Chord: (2, 15))

- Cycle 12: 2-19-1-10 (Chord: (2, 10))
- Cycle 13: 18-15-10-1 (Chord: (18, 1))
- Cycle 14: 18-17-9-15 (Chord: (18, 15))
- Cycle 15: 18-2-14-5 (Chord: (18, 5))
- Cycle 16: 18-3-6-2 (Chord: (18, 2))
- Cycle 17: 4-11-13-12 (Chord: (4, 13))
- Cycle 18: 17-18-2-19 (Chord: (17, 2))
- Cycle 19: 17-16-3-1 (Chord: (17, 1))
- Cycle 20: 17-0-8-10 (Chord: (17, 8))
- Cycle 21: 17-9-15-12 (Chord: (17, 12))
- Cycle 22: 5-13-12-15 (Chord: (5, 15))
- Cycle 23: 5-0-17-18 (Chord: (5, 18))
- Cycle 24: 5-16-3-1 (Chord: (5, 1))
- Cycle 25: 5-7-14-2 (Chord: (5, 14))
- Cycle 26: 5-14-2-8 (Chord: (5, 8))
- Cycle 27: 10-15-12-13 (Chord: (10, 13))
- Cycle 28: 7-5-14-2 (Chord: (7, 14))
- Cycle 29: 11-13-12-15 (Chord: (11, 15))
- Cycle 30: 16-17-0-5 (Chord: (16, 5))

Step 2:
Among the listed cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- <3, 1, 10, 15> (Chord: (3, 15))
- <3, 6, 2, 18> (Chord: (3, 18))
- <3, 18, 17, 16> (Chord: (3, 16))
- <15, 10, 1, 3> (Chord: (15, 1))
- <15, 18, 17, 16> (Chord: (15, 16))
- <15, 12, 13, 11> (Chord: (15, 13))
- <1, 10, 8, 2> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <13, 12, 15, 10> (Chord: (13, 10))
- <2, 8, 10, 15> (Chord: (2, 15))
- <2, 18, 17, 16> (Chord: (2, 16))
- <2, 19, 1, 10> (Chord: (2, 10))
- <18, 15, 10, 1> (Chord: (18, 1))
- <18, 17, 9, 15> (Chord: (18, 15))
- <18, 2, 14, 5> (Chord: (18, 5))
- <18, 3, 6, 2> (Chord: (18, 2))
- <5, 13, 12, 15> (Chord: (5, 15))
- <5, 0, 17, 18> (Chord: (5, 18))
- <5, 16, 3, 1> (Chord: (5, 1))
- <5, 7, 14, 2> (Chord: (5, 14))
- <5, 14, 2, 8> (Chord: (5, 8))
- <10, 15, 12, 13> (Chord: (10, 13))
- <7, 5, 14, 2> (Chord: (7, 14))
- <11, 13, 12, 15> (Chord: (11, 15))
- <16, 17, 0, 5> (Chord: (16, 5))

Step 3:
There are 24 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [24].
