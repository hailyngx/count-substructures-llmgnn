Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 4) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <6, 9, 1, 13, 8, 6>
- <6, 9, 1, 5, 7, 6>
- <6, 9, 1, 13, 2, 3, 5, 7, 6>
- <6, 9, 10, 4, 3, 5, 7, 6>
- <6, 8, 14, 2, 3, 5, 7, 6>
- <6, 8, 14, 2, 13, 1, 5, 7, 6>
- <6, 8, 14, 7, 5, 0, 3, 2, 13, 8>
- <9, 1, 5, 7, 12, 11, 4, 10, 6>
- <9, 1, 5, 7, 14, 2, 3, 4, 10, 6>
- <9, 10, 4, 3, 11, 12, 7, 5, 1, 9>
- <8, 14, 7, 5, 3, 2, 13, 1, 9, 6>
- <8, 14, 2, 3, 4, 10, 6, 7, 5, 0>
- <1, 5, 0, 3, 4, 10, 6, 7, 12, 11>
- <2, 14, 7, 5, 0, 3, 4, 10, 6, 9>
- <13, 2, 3, 4, 10, 6, 7, 5, 1, 9>

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, 9, 1, 13, 8, 6> has exactly one chord (1, 13)
- <6, 9, 10, 4, 3, 5, 7, 6> has exactly one chord (4, 10)
- <6, 8, 14, 2, 13, 1, 5, 7, 6> has exactly one chord (1, 7)
- <8, 14, 7, 5, 0, 3, 2, 13, 8> has exactly one chord (0, 2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
