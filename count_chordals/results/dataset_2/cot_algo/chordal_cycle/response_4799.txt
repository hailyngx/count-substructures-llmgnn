Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 15) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 10) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 11) (19, 0) (19, 5) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 16) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 18) (2, 12) (2, 11) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 17) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 4) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 1) (17, 8) (17, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 3, 7, 11, 4)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 8, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 0, 19, 5, 12, 11, 2, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 4, 11, 2, 12, 5, 19, 0, 6, 1, 8, 17, 18, 9, 15, 10, 7, 3)
- Cycle 5: (14, 16, 15, 9, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has chord (1, 8).
- Cycle 3 has chord (6, 19).
- Cycle 4 has chords (3, 12) and (4, 11).
- Cycle 5 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 2 chordless cycles found, so the final number inside brackets is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 8, 17, 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, 19, 5, 12>
