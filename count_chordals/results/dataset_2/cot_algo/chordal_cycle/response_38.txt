Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (0, 2, 1, 3, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 2, 7, 6, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 4, 3, 0)
- Cycle 4: (1, 2, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 4, 5, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 6, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 9, 3, 4, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 7, 6, 1, 2)
- Cycle 9: (5, 9, 1, 3, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 4, 3, 9, 5)
- Cycle 11: (6, 7, 2, 9, 6)
- Cycle 12: (7, 0, 5, 4, 7)
- Cycle 13: (7, 9, 3, 1, 7)
- Cycle 14: (8, 0, 5, 9, 8)
- Cycle 15: (8, 3, 4, 5, 8)
- Cycle 16: (8, 1, 6, 7, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (2, 7), 6, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
