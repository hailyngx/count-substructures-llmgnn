Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4 or more: 
    - Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 7, 2, 3, 5>
    - Cycle 2: <5, 9, 3, 12, 2, 7, 5>
    - Cycle 3: <5, 1, 4, 8, 0, 14, 5>
    - Cycle 4: <5, 1, 0, 8, 4, 13, 5>
    - Cycle 5: <5, 3, 7, 6, 8, 1, 5>
    - Cycle 6: <5, 14, 6, 9, 3, 12, 5>
    - Cycle 7: <9, 6, 7, 11, 3, 5, 9>
    - Cycle 8: <9, 3, 12, 13, 4, 1, 9>
    - Cycle 9: <4, 8, 14, 0, 1, 4>
    - Cycle 10: <4, 1, 0, 8, 6, 13, 4>
    - Cycle 11: <7, 11, 0, 8, 4, 1, 7>
    - Cycle 12: <7, 3, 12, 13, 6, 9, 7>
    - Cycle 13: <6, 9, 3, 12, 13, 10, 6>
    - Cycle 14: <6, 7, 2, 12, 13, 10, 6>
    - Cycle 15: <8, 0, 11, 7, 6, 13, 8>
    - Cycle 16: <0, 8, 6, 13, 12, 2, 0>
    - Cycle 17: <14, 0, 8, 6, 7, 11, 14>
    - Cycle 18: <2, 7, 11, 0, 14, 5, 2>
    - Cycle 19: <12, 2, 7, 11, 6, 9, 12>
    - Cycle 20: <11, 7, 3, 5, 1, 0, 11>
    - Cycle 21: <3, 5, 1, 4, 13, 12, 3>
    - Cycle 22: <1, 5, 14, 0, 11, 7, 1>
    - Cycle 23: <13, 4, 1, 5, 10, 6, 13>

Step 2: 
- Chordal 4-cycles:
    - <5, (9, 3), 12>
    - <5, (1, 0), 8>
    - <5, (3, 7), 6>
    - <9, (6, 7), 11>
    - <9, (3, 12), 13>
    - <4, (8, 0), 14>
    - <4, (1, 0), 8>
    - <7, (11, 0), 8>
    - <7, (3, 12), 13>
    - <6, (9, 3), 12>
    - <6, (7, 2), 12>
    - <8, (0, 11), 7>
    - <0, (8, 6), 13>
    - <14, (0, 8), 6>
    - <2, (7, 11), 6>
    - <12, (2, 7), 11>
    - <11, (7, 3), 5>
    - <3, (5, 1), 4>
    - <1, (5, 14), 0>
    - <13, (4, 1), 5>

Step 3:
- Number of chordless 4-cycles: [3]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <5, (9, 3), 12>
- <5, (1, 0), 8>
- <5, (3, 7), 6>
