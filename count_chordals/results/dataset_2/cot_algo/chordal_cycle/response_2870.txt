Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 17) (26, 22) (5, 11) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 3) (22, 26) (22, 23) (22, 16) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 29) (8, 23) (8, 19) (8, 28) (15, 20) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 11) (20, 10) (6, 22) (6, 27) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 12) (29, 23) (29, 20) (3, 17) (3, 21) (3, 28) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 24) (19, 27) (28, 8) (28, 3) (28, 4) (4, 23) (4, 15) (4, 28) (4, 10) (11, 5) (11, 20) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 27) (24, 19) (24, 11) (24, 25) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 27) (7, 18) (25, 9) (25, 24) (25, 2) (2, 21) (2, 19) (2, 25) (2, 16) (13, 14) (18, 14) (18, 7) (16, 22) (16, 15) (16, 2) (10, 20) (10, 4) (27, 6) (27, 19) (27, 11) (27, 7) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- (1, 14, 17, 9, 25)
- (1, 14, 17, 3, 21, 2, 25)
- (1, 14, 17, 3, 21, 12, 1)
- (1, 14, 17, 3, 28, 4, 23)
- (1, 14, 18, 7, 11, 5)
- (1, 14, 18, 7, 11, 20, 29, 23)
- (1, 14, 18, 7, 27, 11, 5)
- (1, 14, 18, 7, 27, 6, 22, 26)
- (1, 14, 18, 7, 27, 6, 22, 23)
- (1, 14, 18, 7, 27, 19, 8, 23)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The cycle (1, 14, 17, 9, 25) has one chord: (17, 9)
- The cycle (1, 14, 17, 3, 21, 2, 25) has one chord: (3, 21)
- The cycle (1, 14, 18, 7, 11, 5) has one chord: (7, 11)
- The cycle (1, 14, 18, 7, 27, 6, 22, 26) has one chord: (7, 27)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 14, 17, 9, 25>
- <1, 14, 17, 3, 21, 2, 25>
- <1, 14, 18, 7, 11, 5>
- <1, 14, 18, 7, 27, 6, 22, 26>
