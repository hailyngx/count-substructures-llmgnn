- Cycle 4: (6, 25, 5, 20, 2)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 8, 21, 0)
- Cycle 6: (10, 12, 11, 26, 14)
- Cycle 7: (10, 13, 18, 27, 13)
- Cycle 8: (17, 23, 18, 27, 13)
- Cycle 9: (17, 19, 5, 25, 15)
- Cycle 10: (17, 5, 20, 2, 16)
- Cycle 11: (4, 8, 21, 18, 27)
- Cycle 12: (4, 0, 29, 5, 25)
- Cycle 13: (8, 6, 25, 5, 19)

- Cycle 18: (28, 3, 24, 2, 20)
- Cycle 19: (28, 0, 21, 18, 27)
- Cycle 20: (28, 2, 16, 7, 22)
- Cycle 21: (1, 15, 25, 5, 29)
- Cycle 22: (1, 14, 26, 11, 12)
- Cycle 23: (15, 4, 0, 29, 5)
- Cycle 24: (15, 1, 23, 18, 27)
- Cycle 25: (15, 25, 5, 29, 0)
- Cycle 26: (20, 2, 16, 7, 22)
