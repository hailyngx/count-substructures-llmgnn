Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 10) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (7, 6, 5, 9)
- Cycle 2: (7, 6, 2, 0)
- Cycle 3: (7, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 4: (14, 9, 5, 13)
- Cycle 5: (14, 9, 1, 0)
- Cycle 6: (14, 12, 10, 4)
- Cycle 7: (0, 5, 9, 8)
- Cycle 8: (0, 5, 6, 2)
- Cycle 9: (0, 1, 7, 6)
- Cycle 10: (0, 1, 11, 7)
- Cycle 11: (0, 1, 8, 9)
- Cycle 12: (0, 13, 3, 7)
- Cycle 13: (0, 14, 9, 8)
- Cycle 14: (6, 2, 0, 5)
- Cycle 15: (6, 2, 11, 7)
- Cycle 16: (6, 7, 3, 13)
- Cycle 17: (1, 11, 7, 3)
- Cycle 18: (1, 11, 4, 10)
- Cycle 19: (10, 4, 13, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <7, (6, 5), 9>
- <7, (6, 2), 0>
- <7, (1, 0), 5>
- <14, (9, 5), 13>
- <14, (9, 1), 0>
- <14, (12, 10), 4>
- <0, (5, 9), 8>
- <0, (5, 6), 2>
- <0, (1, 7), 6>
- <0, (1, 11), 7>
- <0, (1, 8), 9>
- <0, (13, 3), 7>
- <0, (14, 9), 8>
- <6, (2, 0), 5>
- <6, (2, 11), 7>
- <6, (7, 3), 13>
- <1, (11, 7), 3>
- <1, (11, 4), 10>
- <10, (4, 13), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, there are 0 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [0].
