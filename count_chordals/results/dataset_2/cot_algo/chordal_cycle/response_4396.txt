Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- <1, 23, 2, 12> has a chord (1, 12)
- <1, 23, 24, 14> has a chord (23, 14)
- <1, 23, 16, 0> has a chord (1, 0)
- <1, 23, 2, 12> has a chord (1,12)
- <1, 23, 16, 0> has a chord (16,0)
- <1, 2, 12, 4> has a chord (2,4)
- <2, 23, 24, 14> has a chord (2,14)
- <23, 24, 14, 27> has a chord (24, 14)
- <24, 14, 27, 25> has a chord (14, 27)
- <14, 27, 25, 13> has a chord (27, 25)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles found: 
This graph has 10 chordal 4-cycles, so the answer is [10]. 

I have listed the chordal 4-cycles below: 
- <1, 23, 24, 3>
- <1, 23, 24, 10>
- <1, 23, 16, 11>
- <1, 23, 2, 12>

- <1, 16, 0, 5>
- <1, 16, 0, 15>
- <1, 16, 0, 5>
- <1, 2, 12, 4>
- <23, 24, 14, 10>
