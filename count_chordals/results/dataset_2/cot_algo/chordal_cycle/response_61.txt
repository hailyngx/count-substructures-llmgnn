Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 11) (9, 3) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 11) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 11) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 14, 4, 5, 13, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 14, 7, 8, 9, 13, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 0, 14, 7, 8, 6, 13, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 4, 5, 13, 9, 3, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 4, 10, 12, 5, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 4, 10, 0, 1, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 3, 9, 8, 6, 11, 2)
- Cycle 8: (3, 9, 13, 6, 11, 12, 3)
- Cycle 9: (4, 5, 13, 9, 8, 7, 14, 4)
- Cycle 10: (5, 12, 10, 2, 3, 12, 5)
- Cycle 11: (6, 8, 9, 13, 11, 7, 14, 6)
- Cycle 12: (6, 11, 7, 8, 9, 13, 6)
- Cycle 13: (7, 8, 9, 13, 6, 11, 7)
- Cycle 14: (10, 4, 5, 13, 9, 3, 12, 10)
- Cycle 15: (11, 13, 9, 3, 2, 10, 12, 11)

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (4, 13)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (8, 13)
- Cycle 11 has exactly one chord: (8, 13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, thus the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (4, 13), 5>
- <2, (8, 13), 6>
- <11, (8, 13), 7>
