Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<14, (17, 22), 23, 14>
<14, (17, 29), 28, 14>
<17, (22, 23), 26, 17>
<17, (29, 28), 15, 17>
<22, (23, 4), 8, 22>
<23, (22, 17), 29, 23>
<23, (26, 11), 27, 23>
<9, (10, 0), 25, 9>
<4, (8, 12), 7, 4>
<8, (20, 18), 15, 8>
<28, (29, 17), 22, 28>
<28, (15, 24), 1, 28>
<18, (20, 8), 12, 18>
<18, (15, 24), 26, 18>
<26, (23, 22), 17, 26>
<26, (12, 8), 20, 26>
<5, (18, 20), 8, 5>
<5, (13, 28), 15, 5>
<13, (9, 10), 0, 13>
<9, (23, 22), 17, 9>
<25, (0, 10), 9, 25>
<11, (26, 12), 7, 11>
<11, (27, 1), 2, 11>
<15, (28, 29), 17, 15>
<6, (13, 28), 15, 6>
<3, (26, 12), 7, 3>
<1, (24, 15), 18, 1>
<21, (18, 15), 24, 21>
<16, (5, 18), 20, 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
