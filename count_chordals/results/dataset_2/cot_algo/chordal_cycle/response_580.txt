Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 1, 3, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 5: (6, 1, 3, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 1, 7, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 2, 4, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 2, 5, 6)
- Cycle 9: (1, 3, 9, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 7, 4, 1)
- Cycle 11: (3, 1, 7, 3)
- Cycle 12: (2, 4, 8, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 5, 6, 2)
- Cycle 14: (4, 7, 0, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 8, 9, 4)
- Cycle 16: (7, 0, 8, 7)
- Cycle 17: (7, 1, 6, 7)
- Cycle 18: (0, 4, 8, 0)
- Cycle 19: (0, 7, 9, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (6, 2), 5>
- Cycle 2: <2, (5, 1), 6>
- Cycle 4: <4, (7, 0), 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, (1, 7), 6>
- Cycle 7: <7, (6, 2), 4>
- Cycle 12: <12, (2, 8), 4>
- Cycle 14: <14, (0, 8), 7>
- Cycle 16: <16, (8, 4), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
As we found 8 cycles with exactly one chord, the final count is [8].
