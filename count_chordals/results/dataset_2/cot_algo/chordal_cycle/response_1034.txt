Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 9-6-1-9
- Cycle 2: 9-4-2-5-9
- Cycle 3: 9-11-7-5-9
- Cycle 4: 10-11-9-12-10
- Cycle 5: 10-3-13-2-10
- Cycle 6: 10-8-5-7-10
- Cycle 7: 10-14-1-14-10
- Cycle 8: 11-1-14-4-11
- Cycle 9: 2-12-9-11-2
- Cycle 10: 2-5-8-14-2
- Cycle 11: 8-10-14-0-8
- Cycle 12: 0-14-4-12-0
- Cycle 13: 14-1-6-9-14
- Cycle 14: 5-10-8-14-5
- Cycle 15: 5-7-11-1-5
- Cycle 16: 13-2-12-9-13
- Cycle 17: 13-3-10-8-13
- Cycle 18: 13-7-5-2-13
- Cycle 19: 7-11-9-12-7
- Cycle 20: 4-9-11-7-4
- Cycle 21: 4-2-13-3-4
- Cycle 22: 4-0-14-1-4
- Cycle 23: 12-9-4-0-12
- Cycle 24: 1-6-9-4-1
- Cycle 25: 3-10-11-7-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord: <9, (9, 11), 2>
- Cycle 10 has exactly one chord: <10, (10, 14), 5>
- Cycle 13 has exactly one chord: <14, (14, 1), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 22 chordless cycles identified.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [22].
