Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 23) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 7) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 5) (7, 2) (7, 21) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 28) (21, 7) (4, 7) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 25) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 19) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 17) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 0) (20, 1) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 24) (18, 28) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 1) (22, 6) (26, 6) (26, 25) (26, 17) (3, 9) (3, 13) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 12) (15, 23) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 23) (19, 25) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 27) (11, 1) (11, 12) (13, 3) (13, 28) (13, 27) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 19) (16, 17) (16, 10) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 12) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 28) (5, 29) (5, 18) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 16) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 17) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 13) (28, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <6, 9, 3, 13>
- Cycle <2, 29, 5, 18>
- Cycle <2, 7, 4, 14>
- Cycle <2, 29, 20, 1>
- Cycle <29, 20, 0, 24>
- Cycle <29, 19, 23, 9>
- Cycle <7, 21, 4, 14>
- Cycle <10, 8, 25, 26>
- Cycle <14, 1, 11, 12>
- Cycle <16, 17, 0, 20>
- Cycle <17, 26, 25, 19>
- Cycle <27, 1, 14, 4>
- Cycle <28, 7, 4, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <2, 29, 5, 18> has chord (29, 5)
- <2, 7, 4, 14> has chord (7, 14)
- <7, 21, 4, 14> has chord (21, 14)
- <10, 8, 25, 26> has chord (8, 25)
- <16, 17, 0, 20> has chord (17, 0)
- <27, 1, 14, 4> has chord (1, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<2, 29, 5, 18>
<2, 7, 4, 14>
<7, 21, 4, 14>
<10, 8, 25, 26>
<16, 17, 0, 20>
<27, 1, 14, 4>
