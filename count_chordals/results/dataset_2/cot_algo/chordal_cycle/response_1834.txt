Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 6) (7, 12) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 16) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 9) (14, 16) (4, 19) (4, 13) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 17) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 14) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 13) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 15) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 17) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 15) (1, 10) (17, 18) (17, 9) (17, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - 4-cycle: 0-16-14-9-0
        - 4-cycle: 2-3-13-4-2
        - 4-cycle: 2-3-13-15-2
        - 4-cycle: 2-6-11-5-2
        - 4-cycle: 2-6-11-10-2
        - 4-cycle: 2-6-3-5-2
        - 4-cycle: 3-13-15-18-3
        - 4-cycle: 3-13-15-19-3
        - 4-cycle: 5-11-18-15-5
        - 4-cycle: 5-11-10-19-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (16, 14), 9, 0>
        - Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (3, 13), 4, 2>
        - Non-chordal 4-cycle: <2, 3, 13, 15, 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (6, 11), 5, 2>
        - Non-chordal 4-cycle: <2, 6, 11, 10, 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (6, 3), 5, 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (13, 15), 18, 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (13, 15), 19, 3>
        - Non-chordal 4-cycle: <5, 11, 18, 15, 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (11, 19), 10, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        There are [5] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
