Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 6) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 17) (1, 9) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (9, 1) (9, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 4) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (16, 13) (16, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges in the graph:
    - Cycle 1: <3, 15, 2, 5, 3>
    - Cycle 2: <7, 0, 3, 10, 12, 2, 5, 4, 19, 8, 17, 7>
    - Cycle 3: <13, 4, 19, 17, 5, 2, 15, 11, 12, 6, 13>
    - Cycle 4: <13, 4, 19, 17, 5, 2, 18, 12, 6, 7, 17, 1, 9, 11, 15, 2, 12, 10, 4, 16, 13>
    - Cycle 5: <8, 19, 4, 13, 6, 12, 2, 18, 5, 8>
    - Cycle 6: <17, 1, 9, 11, 15, 3, 0, 7, 6, 12, 11, 9, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - Cycle 1 has a chord: (2, 15)
    - Cycle 2 has a chord: (7, 17)
    - Cycle 3 has a chord: (15, 11)
    - Cycle 4 has a chord: (2, 18)
    - Cycle 5 does not have exactly one chord
    - Cycle 6 has a chord: (15, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, 15, 2, 5> with chord (2, 15)
- <7, 0, 3, 10, 12, 2, 5, 4, 19, 8, 17, 7> with chord (7, 17)
- <13, 4, 19, 17, 5, 2, 15, 11, 12, 6, 13> with chord (15, 11)
- <13, 4, 19, 17, 5, 2, 18, 12, 6, 7, 17, 1, 9, 11, 15, 2, 12, 10, 4, 16, 13> with chord (2, 18)
