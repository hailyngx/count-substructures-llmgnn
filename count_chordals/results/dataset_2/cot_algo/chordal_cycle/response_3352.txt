Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 12 - 13 - 12 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 12 - 1 - 10 - 8 - 14 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 14 - 4 - 3 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 4: 9 - 12 - 1 - 10 - 8 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 5: 9 - 6 - 0 - 7 - 5 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 6 - 8 - 10 - 1 - 12 - 9
- Cycle 7: 6 - 3 - 4 - 14 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 8: 8 - 6 - 3 - 7 - 14 - 8
- Cycle 9: 8 - 14 - 5 - 7 - 0 - 8
- Cycle 10: 8 - 14 - 7 - 1 - 10 - 8
- Cycle 11: 6 - 8 - 11 - 2 - 10 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 12: 6 - 8 - 14 - 4 - 3 - 11 - 6
- Cycle 13: 6 - 9 - 12 - 1 - 7 - 0 - 6
- Cycle 14: 6 - 9 - 12 - 13 - 12 - 9
- Cycle 15: 6 - 9 - 12 - 7 - 3 - 6

Step 2:  
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 2 has chord 1-14, so it is not a chordal cycle.
- Cycle 4 has chord 6-8, so it is not a chordal cycle.
- Cycle 6 has chord 9-1, so it is not a chordal cycle.
- Cycle 11 has chord 8-1, so it is not a chordal cycle.
- Cycle 12 has chord 6-3, so it is not a chordal cycle.
- Cycle 13 has chord 9-1, so it is not a chordal cycle.

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 9 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<5, 7, 12, 1>
<5, 14, 8, 6>
