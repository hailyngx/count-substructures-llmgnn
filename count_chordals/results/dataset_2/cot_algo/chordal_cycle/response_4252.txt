Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 10) (8, 16) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 2) (12, 17) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 17) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 14) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 13) (17, 12) (17, 15) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 18) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 9 - 6 - 11 - 9
- Cycle 2: 7 - 9 - 11 - 13 - 7
- Cycle 3: 4 - 18 - 9 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 4: 2 - 12 - 17 - 15 - 2
- Cycle 5: 10 - 8 - 16 - 1 - 10
- Cycle 6: 19 - 2 - 10 - 13 - 19
- Cycle 7: 14 - 7 - 9 - 18 - 14

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 <9, (6, 11), 9> has 1 chord
- Cycle 2 <7, (9, 11), 13> has 1 chord
- Cycle 3 <4, (18, 7), 9> has 1 chord
- Cycle 4 <2, (12, 17), 15> has 1 chord
- Cycle 5 <10, (8, 16), 1> has 1 chord
- Cycle 6 <19, (2, 10), 13> has 1 chord
- Cycle 7 <14, (7, 9), 18> has 1 chord

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is therefore [7].
