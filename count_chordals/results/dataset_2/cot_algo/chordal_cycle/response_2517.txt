Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (0, 1, 9, 5)
- (0, 1, 8, 7)
- (0, 5, 6, 7)
- (1, 6, 7, 8)
- (1, 9, 5, 6)
- (2, 3, 4, 9)
- (2, 3, 7, 8)
- (2, 4, 9, 5)
- (2, 7, 6, 1)
- (3, 4, 9, 1)
- (3, 4, 7, 6)
- (3, 7, 6, 5)
- (4, 7, 6, 5)
- (7, 6, 5, 0)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with one chord:
- <0, (1, 9), 5>
- <0, (1, 8), 7>
- <0, (5, 6), 7>
- <1, (6, 7), 8>
- <1, (5, 9), 6>
- <2, (3, 4), 9>
- <2, (3, 7), 8>
- <2, (4, 5), 9>
- <2, (1, 6), 7>
- <3, (4, 9), 1>
- <3, (4, 7), 6>
- <3, (6, 5), 7>
- <4, (6, 7), 5>
- <7, (6, 5), 0>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found in this graph. So, the final count is [0].
