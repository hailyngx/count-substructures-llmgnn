Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 17) (14, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 12) (18, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 9) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 13) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 13) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 11 - 16 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 11 - 16 - 1 - 2 - 7 - 4 - 8 - 15 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 11 - 16 - 1 - 6 - 12 - 8 - 4 - 7 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 11 - 16 - 1 - 6 - 12 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 5: 3 - 11 - 16 - 1 - 2 - 7 - 4 - 8 - 15 - 6 - 12 - 9 - 3
- Cycle 6: 3 - 11 - 16 - 1 - 6 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 7: 7 - 4 - 8 - 15 - 6 - 1 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 8: 7 - 4 - 8 - 15 - 6 - 12 - 9 - 3 - 17 - 7
- Cycle 9: 10 - 14 - 15 - 6 - 12 - 9 - 0 - 10
- Cycle 10: 10 - 14 - 15 - 8 - 4 - 7 - 2 - 12 - 9 - 0 - 10
- Cycle 11: 13 - 19 - 8 - 4 - 7 - 2 - 1 - 16 - 11 - 0 - 13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 11, 16, 1, (11, 16)>
- <0, 11, 16, 1, 2, 7, 4, 8, 15, 6, (4, 15), 0>
- <0, 11, 16, 1, 6, 12, 8, 4, 7, 2, (4, 2), 0>
- <0, 11, 16, 1, 6, 12, (6, 12), 0>
- <3, 11, 16, 1, 2, 7, 4, 8, 15, 6, 12, 9, (12, 9), 3>
- <3, 11, 16, 1, 6, 0, (0, 3)>
- <7, 4, 8, 15, 6, 1, 2, (1, 2), 7>
- <7, 4, 8, 15, 6, 12, 9, 3, 17, (9, 17), 7>
- <10, 14, 15, 6, 12, 9, 0, (9, 0), 10>
- <10, 14, 15, 8, 4, 7, 2, 12, 9, 0, (4, 7), 10>
- <13, 19, 8, 4, 7, 2, 1, 16, 11, 0, (11, 13)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

So, the unique chordal 4-cycles are <0, 11, 16, 1, (11, 16)> and <13, 19, 8, 4, 7, 2, 1, 16, 11, 0, (11, 13)>
