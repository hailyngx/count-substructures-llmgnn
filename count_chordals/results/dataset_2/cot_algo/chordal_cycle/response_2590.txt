Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 4) (8, 17) (8, 13) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (10, 14) (10, 17) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 16) (11, 5) (15, 9) (15, 16) (19, 14) (19, 1) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 12) (7, 14) (7, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. (1, 6, 9, 15)
2. (1, 6, 0, 9)
3. (1, 6, 9, 4)
4. (2, 13, 8, 17)
5. (2, 13, 12, 16)
6. (2, 13, 17, 8)
7. (4, 18, 17, 8)
8. (4, 18, 17, 13)
9. (4, 18, 1, 6)
10. (4, 18, 1, 19)
11. (4, 9, 6, 1)
12. (4, 9, 6, 0)
13. (4, 9, 6, 15)
14. (4, 9, 15, 16)
15. (4, 9, 15, 16)
16. (4, 16, 12, 13)
17. (4, 16, 12, 2)
18. (4, 16, 15, 9)
19. (4, 16, 15, 16)
20. (5, 2, 13, 17)
21. (5, 2, 13, 12)
22. (5, 2, 16, 15)
23. (5, 2, 16, 12)
24. (7, 3, 16, 15)
25. (7, 3, 4, 9)
26. (7, 14, 17, 8)
27. (7, 14, 17, 18)
28. (11, 5, 2, 13)
29. (11, 5, 2, 12)
30. (12, 13, 2, 5)
31. (12, 13, 2, 16)
32. (12, 13, 17, 8)
33. (12, 16, 15, 9)
34. (12, 16, 15, 16)
35. (12, 16, 3, 7)
36. (16, 15, 9, 6)
37. (16, 15, 9, 4)
38. (16, 15, 9, 6)

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
1. <1, (6, 9), 15>
2. <1, (6, 0), 9>
3. <1, (6, 9), 4>
4. <2, (13, 12), 16>
5. <4, (18, 1), 6>
6. <4, (18, 1), 19>
7. <4, (9, 6), 1>
8. <4, (9, 6), 0>
9. <4, (9, 6), 15>
10. <4, (16, 12), 13>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [28].
