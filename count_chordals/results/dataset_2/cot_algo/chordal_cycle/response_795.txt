Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (19, 1), 22, 29> has one chord (19, 1).
- <5, (23, 5), 17, 3> has one chord (23, 5).
- <6, (0, 6), 26, 14> has one chord (0, 6).
- <21, (20, 21), 12, 13> has one chord (20, 21).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (19, 1), 22, 29>
- <5, (23, 5), 17, 3>
- <6, (0, 6), 26, 14>
- <21, (20, 21), 12, 13>
