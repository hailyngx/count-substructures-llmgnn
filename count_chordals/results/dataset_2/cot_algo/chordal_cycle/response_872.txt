Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 16) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 18) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (18, 17) (6, 10) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 19) (13, 17) (13, 15) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 12) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 19) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 8) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 15) (7, 15) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 6) (8, 12) (8, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- <5, 9, 11, 2>
- <5, 9, 16, 4>
- <5, 9, 1, 14>
- <5, 3, 1, 14>
- <5, 3, 0, 17>
- <9, 11, 19, 14>
- <9, 11, 2, 4>
- <9, 16, 0, 3>
- <14, 1, 3, 0>
- <14, 1, 10, 6>
- <17, 0, 3, 5>
- <17, 0, 4, 2>
- <17, 0, 16, 9>
- <19, 11, 2, 4>
- <19, 14, 1, 3>
- <19, 11, 2, 4>
- <15, 13, 17, 0>
- <15, 13, 17, 18>
- <15, 8, 12, 0>
- <15, 8, 12, 16>

Step 2:
- Remaining cycles after checking for exactly one chord:
  - <5, 9, 1, 14>, Chord: (1, 14)
  - <17, 0, 3, 5>, Chord: (0, 3)
  - <19, 14, 1, 3>, Chord: (1, 3)
  - <15, 13, 17, 0>, Chord: (13, 17)

Step 3:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
