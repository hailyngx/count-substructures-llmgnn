Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 8, 5)

Step 2:
The cycle (5, 3, 6, 5) has a chord (5, 6), making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (5, 6)>
