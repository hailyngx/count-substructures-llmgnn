Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 23) (9, 19) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 23) (17, 29) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 18) (26, 16) (28, 16) (28, 24) (24, 28) (24, 20) (15, 22) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 27) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 22) (19, 11) (23, 9) (23, 12) (23, 0) (23, 27) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 15) (4, 13) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 16) (0, 21) (16, 26) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 14) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 16) (14, 11) (22, 15) (22, 19) (22, 3) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 20) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 25) (5, 12) (5, 25) (5, 27) (25, 9) (25, 12) (25, 2) (25, 5) (20, 24) (20, 3) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 27) (27, 10) (27, 23) (27, 5) (27, 21) (27, 18) (18, 29) (18, 27) (13, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph that have all edges present:

- <6, 9, 19, 22>
- <6, 9, 19, 11>
- <6, 9, 25, 12>
- <6, 7, 12, 5>
- <9, 19, 22, 15>
- <9, 25, 12, 7>
- <7, 12, 25, 5>
- <17, 19, 22, 15>
- <16, 26, 0, 29>
- <16, 0, 21, 17>
- <16, 0, 29, 18>
- <16, 28, 24, 20>
- <19, 22, 15, 4>
- <19, 11, 2, 17>
- <19, 11, 14, 16>
- <23, 27, 21, 0>
- <3, 6, 9, 19>
- <3, 7, 12, 25>
- <2, 17, 19, 22>
- <5, 12, 25, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle <6, 9, 19, 22> with chord (9, 19)  
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, 9, 25, 12> with chord (9, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle <16, 0, 21, 17> with chord (0, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are: 
- <6, 9, 19, 22> with chord (9, 19)
- <6, 9, 25, 12> with chord (9, 12)
- <16, 0, 21, 17> with chord (0, 17)
