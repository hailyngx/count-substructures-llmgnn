Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 7)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 9, 8, 6)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 6, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 6, 3, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 4, 0, 7)
        - Cycle 6: (9, 8, 1, 7)
        - Cycle 7: (9, 1, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 8: (9, 4, 7, 6)
        - Cycle 9: (6, 7, 2, 1)
        - Cycle 10: (6, 2, 1, 9)
        - Cycle 11: (6, 3, 5, 4) 
        - Cycle 12: (6, 8, 9, 5) 
        - Cycle 13: (4, 7, 0, 4)
        - Cycle 14: (4, 0, 7, 6)
        - Cycle 15: (7, 2, 1, 9)
        - Cycle 16: (7, 1, 9, 8)
        - Cycle 17: (1, 2, 6, 5) 
        - Cycle 18: (1, 8, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 19: (3, 5, 9, 1) 
        - Cycle 20: (3, 6, 8, 1) 
        - Cycle 21: (8, 0, 4, 7) 
        - Cycle 22: (8, 6, 7, 4) 
        - Cycle 23: (0, 4, 5, 9) 
        - Cycle 24: (0, 7, 6, 5) 
        - Cycle 25: (2, 1, 9, 5) 
        - Cycle 26: (2, 6, 8, 0)
        - Cycle 27: (2, 7, 4, 5) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, (9, 7), 8>
        - <2, (6, 8), 3>
        - <3, (7, 4), 6>
        - <4, (5, 4), 6>
        - <5, (7, 0), 4>
        - <6, (1, 4), 7>
        - <7, (1, 6), 9>
        - <8, (7, 4), 6>
        - <9, (2, 1), 7>
        - <10, (1, 9), 6>
        - <11, (7, 5), 6>
        - <12, (5, 9), 6>
        - <13, (4, 7), 0>
        - <14, (4, 7), 6>
        - <15, (1, 9), 8>
        - <16, (1, 9), 7>
        - <17, (2, 6), 5>
        - <18, (1, 8), 9>
        - <19, (1, 3), 5>
        - <20, (3, 8), 6>
        - <21, (4, 7), 8>
        - <22, (6, 8), 7>
        - <23, (4, 9), 5>
        - <24, (5, 7), 6>
        - <25, (2, 9), 1>
        - <26, (0, 8), 6>
        - <27, (4, 7), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 27 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [27].
