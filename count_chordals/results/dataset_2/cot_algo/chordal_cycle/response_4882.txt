Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 1-3-8-1
        - Cycle 2: 1-3-9-1
        - Cycle 3: 1-3-8-2
        - Cycle 4: 1-3-6-1
        - Cycle 5: 1-3-6-3
        - Cycle 6: 1-5-2-4
        - Cycle 7: 1-5-8-1
        - Cycle 8: 1-5-8-3
        - Cycle 9: 1-5-2-8
        - Cycle 10: 1-5-3-8
        - Cycle 11: 3-1-5-8
        - Cycle 12: 3-1-8-2
        - Cycle 13: 3-1-9-1
        - Cycle 14: 3-5-2-4
        - Cycle 15: 3-5-8-1
        - Cycle 16: 3-5-8-2
        - Cycle 17: 3-5-8-9
        - Cycle 18: 3-5-1-6
        - Cycle 19: 2-4-5-3
        - Cycle 20: 2-4-5-8
        - Cycle 21: 2-4-5-1
        - Cycle 22: 2-4-5-8
        - Cycle 23: 2-5-8-3
        - Cycle 24: 2-5-8-1
        - Cycle 25: 2-5-8-9
        - Cycle 26: 5-8-7-0
        - Cycle 27: 5-8-3-1
        - Cycle 28: 5-8-1-6
        - Cycle 29: 8-1-3-5
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
        The following cycles have exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 6: 1-5-2-4 (Chord: 2-4)
        - Cycle 14: 3-5-2-4 (Chord: 2-4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        Since we found 2 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, the count of chordless cycles is 29.

Therefore, the final answer is [29].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are <1, 5, 2, 4> and <3, 5, 2, 4>.
