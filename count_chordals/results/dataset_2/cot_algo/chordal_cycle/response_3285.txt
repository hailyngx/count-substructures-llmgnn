Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 2) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (14, 11) (14, 7) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 14) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-2-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-7-8-13-0
- Cycle 3: 0-6-4-5-2-3-0
- Cycle 4: 1-12-2-5-4-6-9-1
- Cycle 5: 1-12-11-13-0-3-2-1
- Cycle 6: 2-5-4-6-9-1-10-2
- Cycle 7: 2-7-3-8-13-11-12-2
- Cycle 8: 3-7-2-10-1-13-8-3
- Cycle 9: 3-8-13-11-5-4-10-2-3
- Cycle 10: 4-6-9-1-12-11-13-0-4
- Cycle 11: 5-4-6-9-1-2-5
- Cycle 12: 7-2-10-1-12-11-14-7
- Cycle 13: 7-3-8-13-11-12-2-7
- Cycle 14: 8-13-11-12-2-7-3-8

Step 2:
- among the above cycles, the following ones have exactly one chord:
    - Cycle 1, Chord: (2, 1)
    - Cycle 5, Chord: (13, 1)

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [12].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <0, 3, 2, 1> with chord (1, 2)
