Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
1. (5, 6, 10, 13)
2. (5, 6, 10, 2)
3. (5, 6, 10, 14)
4. (5, 13, 10, 6)
5. (5, 13, 10, 14)
6. (5, 13, 2, 10)
7. (5, 13, 2, 0)
8. (5, 13, 3, 4)
9. (6, 10, 13, 5)
10. (6, 10, 13, 2)
11. (6, 10, 13, 3)
12. (6, 10, 2, 13)
13. (6, 10, 2, 0)
14. (4, 13, 10, 6)
15. (4, 13, 10, 14)
16. (4, 13, 2, 10)
17. (4, 13, 2, 0)
18. (7, 3, 13, 5)
19. (7, 3, 13, 10)
20. (7, 3, 13, 2)
21. (7, 3, 13, 4)
22. (7, 3, 14, 10)
23. (7, 3, 14, 8)
24. (10, 6, 5, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only the cycle (10, 6, 5, 13) has exactly one chord: (5, 13).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle found, which is <10, 6, 5, 13>.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
