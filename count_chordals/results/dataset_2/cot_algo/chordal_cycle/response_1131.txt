Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle (0, 6, 9, 8)
- Cycle (0, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle (0, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle (2, 9, 8, 4)
- Cycle (2, 9, 8, 0)
- Cycle (2, 9, 0, 6)
- Cycle (2, 9, 0, 8)
- Cycle (2, 4, 3, 7)
- Cycle (2, 4, 8, 9)
- Cycle (2, 1, 8, 9)
- Cycle (1, 5, 7, 6)
- Cycle (1, 5, 7, 0)

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle (0, 6, 9, 8) has one chord (6, 8)
- Cycle (0, 6, 7, 5) has one chord (5, 7)
- Cycle (0, 6, 7, 3) has one chord (3, 7)
- Cycle (2, 4, 3, 7) has one chord (4, 7)
- Cycle (2, 4, 8, 9) has one chord (4, 9)
- Cycle (2, 1, 8, 9) has one chord (1, 9)
- Cycle (1, 5, 7, 6) has one chord (5, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are a total of 7 chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final answer is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <7, (5, 7), 1>
- <4, (4, 7), 2>
- <3, (3, 7), 0>
- <2, (4, 9), 8>
- <1, (1, 9), 2>
- <5, (5, 7), 1>
- <6, (6, 8), 9>
