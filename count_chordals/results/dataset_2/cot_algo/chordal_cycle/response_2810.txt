Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 22) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 1) (2, 12) (2, 21) (2, 11) (2, 0) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 3) (6, 10) (6, 23) (28, 21) (28, 16) (21, 2) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 15) (4, 12) (18, 17) (18, 3) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 8) (17, 18) (17, 16) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 27) (16, 28) (16, 13) (16, 17) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (15, 21) (15, 14) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 23) (23, 6) (23, 11) (23, 12) (8, 21) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 7) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 23) (7, 29) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 25) (7, 14) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 22) (0, 2) (10, 6) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 22) (22, 5) (22, 25) (22, 14) (22, 24) (3, 29) (3, 18) (3, 24) (24, 9) (24, 22) (24, 3) (27, 29) (27, 13) (27, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-1-11-5
- Cycle 2: 2-21-15-14-2
- Cycle 3: 2-21-12-4-2
- Cycle 4: 2-21-8-19-7-2
- Cycle 5: 2-21-8-1-9-5-22-24-9-2
- Cycle 6: 2-21-8-1-7-29-27-20-2
- Cycle 7: 2-21-8-26-25-7-14-22-5-2
- Cycle 8: 2-21-12-23-6-10-2
- Cycle 9: 2-11-23-6-10-2
- Cycle 10: 2-11-23-12-4-2
- Cycle 11: 29-7-19-8-26-13-27-29
- Cycle 12: 29-7-1-9-5-22-14-15-21-29
- Cycle 13: 29-3-18-17-16-28-21-15-14-22-24-3
- Cycle 14: 6-10-2-0-12-4-6
- Cycle 15: 6-10-23-12-20-8-1-7-25-26-13-16-17-18-3-24-22-14-15-6

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 1: 5-9-1-11-5 has exactly one chord (5, 11).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:  
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the answer is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, (5, 11), 9>
