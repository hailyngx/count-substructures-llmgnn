Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 27) (22, 14) (22, 11) (22, 15) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 28) (7, 26) (10, 4) (10, 21) (17, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 20) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 24) (29, 21) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 18) (11, 22) (11, 0) (11, 18) (20, 4) (20, 5) (20, 23) (25, 29) (25, 14) (25, 2) (21, 13) (21, 10) (21, 29) (23, 20) (23, 9) (23, 12) (26, 7) (26, 8) (26, 27) (8, 26) (8, 28) (28, 7) (28, 8) (28, 27) (28, 15) (12, 23) (12, 9) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 0) (15, 22) (15, 28) (15, 19) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 27) (14, 22) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 25) (2, 13) (2, 25) (2, 19) (24, 29) (24, 18) (9, 23) (9, 12) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 24) (18, 27) (18, 0) (27, 13) (27, 26) (27, 28) (27, 19) (27, 18) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-6-5-4
- Cycle 2: 4-10-21-29-1-5-20-4
- Cycle 3: 4-10-21-29-25-2-13-27-18-3-6-7-4
- Cycle 4: 7-4-10-21-29-1-0-11-18-3-6-7
- Cycle 5: 11-22-14-3-6-5-20-4-7-26-27-18-11
- Cycle 6: 14-25-2-13-21-10-4-20-5-6-3-14
- Cycle 7: 18-27-13-21-10-4-20-23-12-9-23-20-5-14-3-18
- Cycle 8: 18-27-19-15-28-7-4-20-23-12-9-23-20-5-14-25-2-19-18
- Cycle 9: 18-0-1-29-21-13-27-26-7-6-5-20-23-12-9-23-20-4-10-21-29-25-14-3-18

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord 6-5
- Cycle 2 has chord 29-1
- Cycle 3 has chord 21-29
- Cycle 4 has chord 21-29
- Cycle 5 has chord 18-3
- Cycle 6 has chord 13-21
- Cycle 7 has chord 27-13
- Cycle 8 has chord 27-19
- Cycle 9 has chord 21-13

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <4, 7, 6, 5, (6, 5)>
- <4, 10, 21, 29, 1, 5, 20, (29, 1)>
- <4, 10, 21, 29, 25, 2, 13, 27, 18, 3, 6, 7, (21, 29)>
- <7, 4, 10, 21, 29, 1, 0, 11, 18, 3, 6, 7, (21, 29)>
- <11, 22, 14, 3, 6, 5, 20, 4, 7, 26, 27, 18, 11, (18, 3)>
- <14, 25, 2, 13, 21, 10, 4, 20, 5, 6, 3, 14, (13, 21)>
- <18, 27, 13, 21, 10, 4, 20, 23, 12, 9, 23, 20, 5, 14, 3, 18, (27, 13)>
- <18, 27, 19, 15, 28, 7, 4, 20, 23, 12, 9, 23, 20, 5, 14, 25, 2, 19, 18, (27, 19)>
- <18, 0, 1, 29, 21, 13, 27, 26, 7, 6, 5, 20, 23, 12, 9, 23, 20, 4, 10, 21, 29, 25, 14, 3, 18, (21, 13)>
