Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle <4, 5, 1, 7, 4> with edges (4, 5), (5, 1), (1, 7), (7, 4), (4, 5)
- Cycle <4, 7, 6, 3, 4> with edges (4, 7), (7, 6), (6, 3), (3, 4), (4, 7)
- Cycle <4, 0, 8, 9, 4> with edges (4, 0), (0, 8), (8, 9), (9, 4), (4, 0)
- Cycle <7, 1, 5, 0, 7> with edges (7, 1), (1, 5), (5, 0), (0, 7), (7, 1)
- Cycle <1, 3, 6, 7, 1> with edges (1, 3), (3, 6), (6, 7), (7, 1), (1, 3)
- Cycle <3, 5, 0, 2, 3> with edges (3, 5), (5, 0), (0, 2), (2, 3), (3, 5)
- Cycle <8, 0, 5, 1, 8> with edges (8, 0), (0, 5), (5, 1), (1, 8), (8, 0)
- Cycle <9, 8, 0, 2, 9> with edges (9, 8), (8, 0), (0, 2), (2, 9), (9, 8)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord:
- <4, 5, 1, 7, 4> has one chord (5, 7) 
- <7, 1, 5, 0, 7> has one chord (1, 5) 
- <9, 8, 0, 2, 9> has one chord (0, 8) 
So, we found 3 chordal 4-cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].
