Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-1-4-6-7-9-8-0
        - Cycle 2: 1-2-5-8-7-6-4-1
        - Cycle 3: 8-9-7-3-0-1-2-8
        - Cycle 4: 4-5-2-6-7-1-0-4
        - Cycle 5: 3-7-9-8-5-2-1-3
        - Cycle 6: 1-0-8-5-2-6-7-1
        - Cycle 7: 3-8-5-2-6-7-4-3
        - Cycle 8: 1-0-3-7-6-2-5-1
        - Cycle 9: 4-6-2-1-0-3-7-4
        - Cycle 10: 8-5-2-1-4-7-6-8

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 1 has 0 chords
        - Cycle 2 has 2 chords
        - Cycle 3 has 2 chords
        - Cycle 4 has 2 chords
        - Cycle 5 has 2 chords
        - Cycle 6 has 2 chords
        - Cycle 7 has 2 chords
        - Cycle 8 has 2 chords
        - Cycle 9 has 2 chords
        - Cycle 10 has 2 chords

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
        There is only 1 chordless cycle, which is Cycle 1: 0-1-4-6-7-9-8-0

Therefore, the final count is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 1, 4, 6>.
