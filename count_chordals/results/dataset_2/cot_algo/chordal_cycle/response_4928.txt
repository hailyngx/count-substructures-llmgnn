Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 9) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 15) (7, 8) (7, 18) (7, 16) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 19) (2, 6) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 19) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 1) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 11) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 15) (17, 0) (17, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (1, 8, 5, 1)
        - Cycle 2: (1, 8, 7, 1)
        - Cycle 3: (1, 8, 13, 10, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (1, 6, 4, 11, 5, 1)
        - Cycle 5: (1, 6, 2, 6, 1)
        - Cycle 6: (1, 6, 2, 6, 4, 11, 5, 1)
        - Cycle 7: (1, 14, 3, 16, 15, 12, 1)
        - Cycle 8: (1, 14, 3, 16, 7, 18, 10, 19, 12, 1)
        - Cycle 9: (1, 14, 3, 16, 7, 8, 13, 10, 19, 12, 1)
        - Cycle 10: (1, 14, 3, 9, 0, 17, 5, 11, 4, 6, 2, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: <1, (8, 5), 1>
        - Cycle 2: <1, (8, 7), 1>
        - Cycle 3: <1, (8, 13), 10, 1>
        - Cycle 4: <1, (6, 4), 11, 5, 1>
        - Cycle 5: <1, (1, 6), 2, 1>
        - Cycle 7: <1, (14, 3), 16, 15, 12, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 5 chordless cycles found. So, the final count is [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
        <1, (8, 13), 10, 1>
        <1, (6, 4), 11, 5, 1>
        <1, (1, 6), 2, 1>
        <1, (14, 3), 16, 15, 12, 1>
