Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 11) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 22) (0, 5) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 9) (11, 15) (11, 27) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 26) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 29) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 25) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 7) (29, 23) (29, 17) (29, 13) (29, 18) (19, 10) (19, 26) (19, 16) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 2) (9, 10) (22, 0) (22, 17) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 1) (24, 14) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 21) (13, 29) (16, 19) (16, 28) (16, 3) (28, 0) (28, 16) (28, 2) (20, 2) (20, 6) (7, 17) (7, 25) (7, 18) (25, 4) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 18) (1, 24) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 20) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (14, 24) (14, 1) (14, 3) (2, 26) (2, 28) (2, 20) (2, 3) (2, 21) (21, 5) (21, 2) (18, 29) (18, 7) (18, 25) (18, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 
- The graph has the following 4-cycles: 
1. <0, 15, 27, 11, 0>
2. <0, 5, 23, 8, 4, 24, 1, 14, 3, 12, 18, 29, 17, 22, 0>
3. <0, 5, 23, 29, 17, 22, 0>
4. <1, 14, 3, 16, 19, 26, 8, 4, 25, 18, 12, 1>
5. <2, 3, 14, 1, 24, 8, 26, 19, 10, 27, 11, 15, 0, 28, 16, 2>
6. <2, 3, 14, 1, 24, 8, 26, 19, 10, 27, 11, 15, 0, 22, 17, 29, 13, 18, 12, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- From the list above, the cycles <0, 15, 27, 11, 0> and <2, 3, 14, 1, 24, 8, 26, 19, 10, 27, 11, 15, 0, 28, 16, 2> have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are [2] chordal 4-cycles found. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 15, 27, 11, 0>
2. <2, 3, 14, 1, 24, 8, 26, 19, 10, 27, 11, 15, 0, 28, 16, 2>
