Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Possible cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-1-6-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-3-5-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-8-1-6-0
- Cycle 4: 0-7-9-8-4-0
- Cycle 5: 1-6-2-0-4-1
- Cycle 6: 1-4-8-9-7-1
- Cycle 7: 2-0-4-3-5-2
- Cycle 8: 2-3-4-8-7-2
- Cycle 9: 2-5-8-1-6-2
- Cycle 10: 3-4-8-5-3
- Cycle 11: 4-8-9-7-4
- Cycle 12: 5-8-4-0-7-5
- Cycle 13: 6-2-0-4-1-6
- Cycle 14: 7-0-4-8-9-7
- Cycle 15: 8-4-0-7-9-8
- Cycle 16: 9-8-4-1-6-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 4, 8, 1, (6, 5)>
- <1, 4, 8, 9, (7, 6)>
- <2, 0, 4, 3, (5, 2)>
- <3, 4, 8, 5, (0, 3)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
