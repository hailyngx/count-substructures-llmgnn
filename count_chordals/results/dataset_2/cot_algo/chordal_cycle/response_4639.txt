Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 7) (14, 9) (14, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 13, 5, 1) - forms a 4-cycle <1, 3, 5, 13>
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 4, 9, 1) - forms a 4-cycle <1, 3, 4, 9>
- Cycle 3: (1, 0, 2, 9, 1) - forms a 4-cycle <1, 0, 2, 9>
- Cycle 4: (1, 13, 4, 9, 1) - forms a 4-cycle <1, 13, 4, 9>
- Cycle 5: (3, 4, 9, 5, 3) - forms a 4-cycle <3, 4, 5, 9>
- Cycle 6: (3, 13, 5, 12, 3) - forms a 4-cycle <3, 5, 12, 13>
- Cycle 7: (3, 13, 4, 9, 3) - forms a 4-cycle <3, 4, 9, 13>
- Cycle 8: (11, 3, 4, 9, 11) - forms a 4-cycle <11, 3, 4, 9>
- Cycle 9: (11, 1, 0, 2, 11) - forms a 4-cycle <11, 1, 0, 2>
- Cycle 10: (11, 13, 5, 1, 11) - forms a 4-cycle <11, 13, 5, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 3, 5, 13> has a chord (1, 13)
- <1, 3, 4, 9> has a chord (3, 9)
- <1, 0, 2, 9> has a chord (0, 9)
- <1, 13, 4, 9> has a chord (13, 4)
- <3, 4, 5, 9> has a chord (5, 9)
- <3, 5, 12, 13> has a chord (5, 12)
- <3, 4, 9, 13> has a chord (4, 13)
- <11, 3, 4, 9> has a chord (3, 9)
- <11, 1, 0, 2> has a chord (0, 2)
- <11, 13, 5, 1> has a chord (13, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found:
