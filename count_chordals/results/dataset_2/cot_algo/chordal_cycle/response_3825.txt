Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (13, 17) (13, 0) (6, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 19) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 9) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 15) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (12, 18) (12, 14) (12, 15) (9, 7) (9, 16) (9, 11) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1-3-4-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-4-19-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-4-2-18-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-4-19-14-12-18-2-1
- Cycle 5: 10-17-13-0-11-1
- Cycle 6: 10-17-13-0-19-4-2-18-16-7-10
- Cycle 7: 10-17-13-0-19-14-12-18-2-5-10
- Cycle 8: 10-17-13-0-11-14-19-4-2-5-10
- Cycle 9: 10-5-2-18-12-14-15-8-10
- Cycle 10: 10-5-2-18-12-14-19-0-13-17-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (4, 2), 3, 1>
- Chordal cycle 2: <1, (4, 19), 3, 1>
- Chordal cycle 3: <1, (18, 2), 4, 3, 1>
- Chordal cycle 4: <1, (18, 2), 4, 19, 14, 12, 18, 2, 1>
- Chordal cycle 5: <10, (0, 13), 17, 10>
- Chordal cycle 6: <10, (0, 19), 4, 2, 18, 16, 7, 10>
- Chordal cycle 7: <10, (0, 19), 4, 2, 18, 12, 14, 10>
- Chordal cycle 8: <10, (11, 14), 19, 4, 2, 5, 10>
- Chordal cycle 9: <10, (12, 14), 18, 2, 5, 10>
- Chordal cycle 10: <10, (12, 14), 18, 2, 5, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:

- There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
