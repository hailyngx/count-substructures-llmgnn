Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 0-6-4-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-6-3-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-6-3-8-0
- Cycle 4: 0-2-8-3-0
- Cycle 5: 0-5-8-2-0
- Cycle 6: 0-5-7-1-0
- Cycle 7: 1-4-8-2-1
- Cycle 8: 3-6-4-8-3
- Cycle 9: 4-1-7-5-4
- Cycle 10: 5-1-3-8-5
- Cycle 11: 7-6-3-1-7
- Cycle 12: 8-3-4-6-8
- Cycle 13: 8-4-1-7-8
- Cycle 14: 8-5-7-6-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <0, (1, 4), 6> - Chord (1, 4)
- <0, (3, 8), 6> - Chord (3, 8)
- <0, (2, 8), 5> - Chord (2, 8)
- <0, (5, 7), 1> - Chord (5, 7)
- <1, (2, 8), 4> - Chord (2, 8)
- <4, (1, 7), 8> - Chord (1, 7)
- <3, (4, 6), 8> - Chord (4, 6)
- <5, (3, 8), 1> - Chord (3, 8)
- <7, (1, 3), 6> - Chord (1, 3)
- <8, (4, 6), 3> - Chord (4, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, so the final count is [10].
