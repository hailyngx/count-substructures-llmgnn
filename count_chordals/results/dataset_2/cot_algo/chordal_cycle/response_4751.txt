Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 27) (9, 21) (9, 24) (18, 20) (18, 29) (18, 13) (22, 2) (22, 12) (22, 3) (14, 17) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 25) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 1) (0, 15) (0, 5) (11, 1) (11, 21) (28, 8) (28, 5) (28, 23) (21, 9) (21, 11) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 23) (25, 4) (25, 15) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 10) (13, 18) (13, 29) (13, 19) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 3) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 27) (2, 24) (24, 9) (24, 2) (24, 27) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 11) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 19) (20, 5) (26, 8) (26, 20) (26, 29) (23, 28) (23, 7) (23, 2) (23, 3) (29, 18) (29, 13) (29, 26) (27, 6) (27, 2) (27, 24) (27, 19) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 27) (3, 22) (3, 16) (3, 23) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 10) (5, 20) (12, 22) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 8, 17, 14, 19, 13)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 8, 26, 20, 19, 27)
- Cycle 3: (1, 11, 21, 9, 24, 27)
- Cycle 4: (2, 3, 16, 7, 19, 14, 17)
- Cycle 5: (2, 3, 23, 7, 19, 20, 26)
- Cycle 6: (4, 8, 1, 11, 21, 9, 24)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 1, 11, 21, 7, 19)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 17, 14, 19, 20, 5)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 17, 14, 19, 27, 2)
- Cycle 10: (4, 8, 26, 20, 19, 13, 29)
- Cycle 11: (5, 10, 15, 0, 5, 28, 23)
- Cycle 12: (5, 10, 16, 7, 19, 13, 29)

Step 2: Checking for each cycle having exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (8, 14), 17, (4, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (8, 26), 20, (4, 27)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (11, 21), 9, (24, 27)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (3, 7), 19, (16, 17)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, (3, 23), 7, (19, 26)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, (8, 11), 21, (9, 24)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, (8, 17), 14, (19, 20)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, (8, 27), 2, (19, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (8, 26), 20, (13, 29)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <5, (10, 0), 15, (5, 28)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <5, (10, 16), 7, (13, 29)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. Therefore, the final count is [11].
