Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (1, 21, 2, 18, 26, 28, 0, 8, 13, 5, 22) with length 10
- Cycle 2: (1, 21, 2, 18, 26, 29, 11, 10, 6, 14, 17) with length 10
- Cycle 3: (1, 21, 2, 18, 26, 29, 11, 12, 27, 1) with length 10
- Cycle 4: (1, 21, 2, 18, 26, 28, 0, 16, 3, 12) with length 10
- Cycle 5: (1, 21, 2, 18, 26, 28, 24, 6, 10, 11) with length 10
- Cycle 6: (1, 21, 2, 18, 26, 28, 0, 8, 4, 10) with length 10
- Cycle 7: (1, 27, 12, 11, 10, 6, 14, 17) with length 8
- Cycle 8: (1, 27, 12, 11, 10, 6, 24, 28) with length 8
- Cycle 9: (1, 27, 12, 11, 10, 4, 8, 13) with length 8
- Cycle 10: (1, 27, 12, 11, 10, 4, 15, 5) with length 8
- Cycle 11: (1, 27, 12, 11, 29, 26, 18, 2) with length 8
- Cycle 12: (1, 27, 12, 3, 16, 0, 8, 13) with length 8
- Cycle 13: (1, 27, 12, 3, 16, 0, 28, 26) with length 8
- Cycle 14: (1, 27, 12, 3, 16, 23, 0, 8) with length 8
- Cycle 15: (1, 27, 12, 3, 16, 23, 9, 7) with length 8
- Cycle 16: (1, 10, 11, 12, 27, 1) with length 6
- Cycle 17: (1, 10, 6, 14, 17) with length 5
- Cycle 18: (1, 10, 6, 24, 28) with length 5
- Cycle 19: (1, 10, 4, 8, 13) with length 5
- Cycle 20: (1, 10, 4, 15, 5) with length 5
- Cycle 21: (1, 10, 11, 29, 26, 18, 2) with length 7
- Cycle 22: (1, 10, 4, 8, 0, 16, 3) with length 7
- Cycle 23: (1, 7, 20, 15, 4, 8) with length 6
- Cycle 24: (1, 7, 20, 15, 5, 13) with length 6
- Cycle 25: (1, 7, 3, 12, 27, 1) with length 6
- Cycle 26: (1, 7, 3, 16, 0, 8) with length 6
- Cycle 27: (1, 7, 3, 16, 23, 9) with length 6
- Cycle 28: (1, 7, 20, 15, 19, 24) with length 6
- Cycle 29: (1, 7, 20, 15, 19, 25) with length 6
- Cycle 30: (1, 16, 0, 8, 4, 10) with length 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <1, 21, 2, (18, 26), 28>
- <1, 21, 2, 18, (26, 29), 11>
- <1, 27, 12, (11, 10), 6>
- <1, 27, 12, (11, 29), 26>
- <1, 27, (12, 3), 16, 0>
- <1, 10, 6, (14, 17), 1>
- <1, 10, 6, (24, 28), 26>
- <1, 10, 4, (8, 13), 5>
- <1, 10, (4, 15), 5, 13>
- <1, 10, 4, (8, 0), 16>
- <1, 7, 20, (15, 19), 24>
- <1, 7, 20, (15, 19), 25>
- <1, 16, 0, (8, 4), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since all cycles in the given graph have at least one chord, there are no chordless cycles.
Therefore, the final count is [0].
