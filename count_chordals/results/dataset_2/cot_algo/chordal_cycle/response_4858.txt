Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 28) (7, 23) (7, 22) (21, 7) (21, 9) (21, 15) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 22) (17, 18) (0, 20) (0, 22) (20, 0) (20, 1) (15, 21) (15, 19) (15, 29) (2, 28) (8, 28) (8, 27) (8, 11) (8, 6) (4, 24) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 16) (13, 10) (13, 26) (13, 3) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 12) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 29) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (5, 18) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 12) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 27) (29, 15) (29, 3) (25, 27) (25, 24) (27, 10) (27, 8) (27, 19) (27, 25) (28, 7) (28, 2) (28, 8) (24, 17) (24, 4) (24, 25) (23, 7) (23, 5) (23, 12) (1, 20) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 18) (9, 21) (9, 11) (12, 26) (12, 5) (12, 23) (12, 6) (14, 19) (22, 7) (22, 17) (22, 0) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (7, 21, 15, 19, 5, 18, 17, 22, 7)
- Cycle 2: (7, 21, 15, 29, 3, 7)
- Cycle 3: (7, 28, 2, 3, 7)
- Cycle 4: (7, 28, 8, 27, 10, 13, 3, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 23, 5, 18, 16, 4, 24, 25, 27, 19, 15, 21, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 23, 5, 18, 17, 10, 26, 13, 3, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 22, 17, 16, 4, 24, 25, 27, 8, 28, 2, 3, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- None of the listed cycles have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Since none of the cycles have exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
