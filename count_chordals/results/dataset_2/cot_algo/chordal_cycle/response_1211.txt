Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-1-3-5
- Cycle 3: 5-4-6-8-5
- Cycle 4: 5-4-1-9-5
- Cycle 5: 5-7-2-8-5
- Cycle 6: 9-6-1-3-9
- Cycle 7: 9-6-4-1-9
- Cycle 8: 9-1-6-4-9
- Cycle 9: 9-1-3-8-9
- Cycle 10: 6-1-3-9-6
- Cycle 11: 6-4-1-9-6
- Cycle 12: 1-9-5-7-1
- Cycle 13: 1-9-6-4-1
- Cycle 14: 1-3-9-5-1
- Cycle 15: 1-3-8-9-1
- Cycle 16: 3-9-5-7-3
- Cycle 17: 3-1-9-5-3
- Cycle 18: 3-1-2-7-3
- Cycle 19: 4-5-8-2-4
- Cycle 20: 4-6-8-2-4
- Cycle 21: 4-6-1-9-4
- Cycle 22: 4-1-6-8-4
- Cycle 23: 4-1-9-5-4
- Cycle 24: 4-8-5-7-4
- Cycle 25: 4-8-2-0-4
- Cycle 26: 7-5-4-1-7
- Cycle 27: 7-5-9-6-7
- Cycle 28: 8-5-4-1-8
- Cycle 29: 8-5-9-2-8
- Cycle 30: 8-6-4-1-8
- Cycle 31: 8-6-9-2-8
- Cycle 32: 8-3-1-9-8
- Cycle 33: 8-3-9-2-8
- Cycle 34: 8-4-6-1-8
- Cycle 35: 8-4-5-7-8
- Cycle 36: 8-2-7-5-8
- Cycle 37: 2-9-1-6-2
- Cycle 38: 2-9-5-7-2
- Cycle 39: 2-1-6-4-2
- Cycle 40: 2-1-3-8-2
- Cycle 41: 2-7-5-4-2
- Cycle 42: 0-4-1-6-0
- Cycle 43: 0-4-8-5-0
- Cycle 44: 0-2-7-5-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The chordal 4-cycle is <1, (4, 9), 6)>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
