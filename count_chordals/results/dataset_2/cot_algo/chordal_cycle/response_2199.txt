Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 21) (21, 7) (21, 26) (21, 29) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 27) (25, 13) (25, 18) (25, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 23) (14, 25) (19, 26) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 27) (26, 21) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 2) (9, 11) (9, 22) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 20) (22, 29) (6, 10) (6, 20) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 26) (2, 10) (12, 16) (12, 8) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 1) (1, 23) (1, 10) (29, 21) (29, 19) (29, 22) (17, 4) (17, 8) (13, 25) (13, 6) (13, 20) (13, 18) (24, 22) (24, 27) (24, 5) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 24) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 1) (18, 25) (18, 0) (18, 13) (8, 12) (8, 17) (20, 22) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 28) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 28) (5, 24) (5, 15) (5, 28) (28, 20) (28, 15) (28, 5) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 3, 11, 16, 12, 8, 17, 4, 2, 10, 6)
- Cycle 2: (0, 3, 11, 9, 22, 20, 6, 10, 2, 4, 7)
- Cycle 3: (1, 23, 26, 21, 7, 4, 17, 8, 12, 16, 15)
- Cycle 4: (13, 6, 10, 1, 23, 26, 2, 4, 17, 8, 12)
- Cycle 5: (13, 6, 10, 2, 4, 23, 26, 19, 27, 24, 5)
- Cycle 6: (20, 22, 9, 11, 16, 15, 5, 24, 27, 3, 0)
- Cycle 7: (20, 22, 9, 11, 3, 27, 24, 5, 15, 28, 20)

Step 2:  
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <0, (16, 12), 8>
- Cycle 2: <0, (2, 4), 7>
- Cycle 3: <1, (7, 17), 8>
- Cycle 4: <1, (2, 26), 4>
- Cycle 5: <5, (4, 17), 8>
- Cycle 6: <0, (16, 15), 5>
- Cycle 7: <9, (11, 27), 24>

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:  
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [0].
