Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <1, 3, 5, 1>
2. <1, 3, 12, 1>
3. <1, 8, 9, 7, 14, 10, 6, 5, 1>
4. <3, 5, 1, 2, 3>
5. <3, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7, 6, 2, 3>
6. <5, 1, 2, 12, 3, 5>
7. <5, 1, 12, 13, 5>
8. <5, 1, 8, 11, 5>
9. <6, 5, 11, 8, 1, 2, 6>
10. <6, 5, 11, 4, 6>
11. <6, 5, 13, 12, 1, 2, 6>
12. <6, 5, 13, 14, 7, 9, 8, 1, 2, 6>
13. (Chordal 4-cycle) <6, 5, 13, 14, 10, 4, 6> with chord (9, 7)
14. <13, 5, 1, 2, 12, 13>
15. <13, 5, 11, 8, 1, 2, 12, 13>
16. <13, 5, 6, 2, 12, 13>
17. <13, 5, 6, 7, 14, 10, 4, 13>
18. <13, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7, 6, 4, 13>
19. <0, 13, 5, 6, 2, 12, 3, 1, 8, 11, 4, 10, 14, 7, 9, 0>
20. (Chordal 4-cycle) <7, 6, 5, 13, 14, 10, 4, 7> with chord (9, 8)
21. <8, 1, 2, 12, 13, 4, 10, 14, 7, 9, 8>
22. <9, 13, 5, 6, 2, 12, 3, 1, 8, 11, 4, 10, 14, 7, 9>
23. <10, 6, 5, 1, 2, 12, 13, 4, 10>
24. <10, 6, 7, 14, 13, 5, 1, 8, 11, 4, 10>
25. <11, 5, 1, 2, 6, 4, 11>
26. <14, 13, 5, 6, 2, 12, 1, 8, 11, 4, 10, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<6, 5, 13, 14, 10, 4, 6> with non-adjacent chords (9, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are a total of [25] chordless cycles in the given graph.
