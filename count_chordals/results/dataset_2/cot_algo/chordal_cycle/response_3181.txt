Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 8, 4, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 4, 7, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 4, 2, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 9, 6, 7, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 9, 6, 2, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 4, 7, 6, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 4, 2, 6, 0)
- Cycle 8: (1, 4, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 4, 3, 0, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 7, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 11: (2, 4, 7, 6, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 4, 0, 6, 2)
- Cycle 13: (3, 4, 7, 2, 3)
- Cycle 14: (3, 4, 0, 2, 3)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has a chord (5, 4) -> <0, (5, 4), 8>
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 7) -> <1, (4, 7), 0>
- Cycle 4 has a chord (6, 7) -> <3, (6, 7), 9>
- Cycle 5 has a chord (6, 2) -> <4, (6, 2), 9>
- Cycle 7 has a chord (4, 6) -> <6, (4, 6), 7>
- Cycle 9 has a chord (4, 3) -> <8, (4, 3), 1>
- Cycle 11 has a chord (4, 6) -> <11, (4, 6), 7>
- Cycle 13 has a chord (4, 2) -> <13, (4, 2), 3>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 14 cycles in total.
- 8 of these cycles have exactly one chord.
- So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
