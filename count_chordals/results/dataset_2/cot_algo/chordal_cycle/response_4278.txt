Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 9 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<6, 1, 4, 8> with chord (1, 4)
<6, 1, 8, 4> with chord (1, 8)
<9, 7, 5, 4> with chord (7, 5)
<8, 6, 5, 4> with chord (6, 5)
<8, 1, 6, 5> with chord (1, 6)
<5, 6, 4, 1> with chord (6, 4)
<2, 5, 4, 1> with chord (5, 1)
<0, 5, 4, 1> with chord (5, 1)
<7, 2, 5, 4> with chord (2, 5)
