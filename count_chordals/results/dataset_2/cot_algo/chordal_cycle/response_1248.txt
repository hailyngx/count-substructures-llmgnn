Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (13, 22, 10, 1, 7, 18, 26, 13)
        - Cycle 2: (13, 22, 21, 9, 5, 13)
        - Cycle 3: (13, 22, 8, 15, 13)
        - Cycle 4: (13, 15, 23, 4, 0, 27, 18, 26, 13)
        - Cycle 5: (25, 3, 13, 22, 21, 9, 8, 22, 10, 1, 7, 18, 0, 27, 6, 29, 25)
        - Cycle 6: (29, 25, 16, 2, 26, 18, 27, 0, 4, 23, 15, 8, 9, 21, 22, 13)
        - Cycle 7: (1, 10, 22, 21, 9, 8, 15, 13)
        - Cycle 8: (7, 1, 10, 22, 13, 15, 8, 9, 21, 22)
        - Cycle 9: (22, 13, 15, 23, 3, 25, 29, 24, 2, 26)
        - Cycle 10: (21, 22, 13, 15, 23, 4, 0, 18, 27, 6, 29)
        - Cycle 11: (0, 27, 6, 29, 25, 3, 23, 4, 24, 29)
        - Cycle 12: (18, 7, 1, 10, 22, 13, 26, 2, 16, 25)
        - Cycle 13: (14, 10, 22, 21, 9, 5, 13, 26, 2, 24)
        - Cycle 14: (16, 25, 29, 24, 2, 26, 18, 0, 4, 23)
        - Cycle 15: (6, 27, 0, 4, 23, 3, 25, 29, 24, 2)
        - Cycle 16: (12, 1, 10, 22, 8, 15, 13, 26, 2, 11)
        - Cycle 17: (17, 19, 1, 7, 18, 0, 4, 23, 15, 8)
        - Cycle 18: (11, 2, 26, 13, 15, 23, 4, 0, 27, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <(13, 22), (10, 1), 7, 18)>
        - <(13, 22), (21, 9), 5, 13>
        - <(13, 22), (8, 15), 13>
        - <(13, 15), (23, 4), 0, 27>
        - <(25, 3), (13, 22), 21, 9>
        - <(25, 3), (13, 22), 21, 9>
        - <(1, 10), (22, 21), 9, 8>
        - <(22, 13), (15, 23), 4, 0>
        - <(21, 22), (13, 15), 23, 4>
        - <(27, 0), (6, 29), 25, 3>
        - <(18, 7), (1, 10), 22, 13>
        - <(14, 10), (22, 21), 9, 5>
        - <(16, 25), (29, 24), 2, 26>
        - <(6, 27), (0, 4), 23, 3>
        - <(12, 1), (10, 22), 8, 15>
        - <(17, 19), (1, 7), 18, 0>
        - <(11, 2), (26, 13), 15, 23>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [17]
