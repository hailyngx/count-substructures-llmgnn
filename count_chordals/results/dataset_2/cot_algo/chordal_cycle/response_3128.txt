Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4: 
- (4, 7, 9, 5, 4)
- (4, 7, 14, 11, 4)
- (4, 3, 13, 6, 4)
- (7, 9, 5, 12, 7)
- (7, 4, 3, 13, 7)
- (7, 14, 11, 8, 7)
- (10, 4, 3, 13, 10)
- (11, 14, 12, 6, 11)
- (8, 9, 1, 11, 8)
- (13, 6, 12, 5, 13)
- (6, 2, 5, 12, 6)
- (0, 9, 1, 11, 0)
- (0, 14, 12, 5, 0)
- (1, 9, 5, 2, 1)
- (12, 5, 2, 1, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <4, (7, 14), 11, 3, 13>
- <7, (9, 5), 12, 8, 11>
- <10, (4, 3), 13, 6, 2>
- <11, (14, 12), 6, 5, 2>
- <8, (9, 1), 11, 5, 12>
- <13, (6, 12), 5, 2, 1>
- <6, (2, 5), 12, 8, 11>
- <0, (9, 1), 11, 5, 12>
- <0, (14, 12), 5, 2, 1>
- <1, (9, 5), 2, 6, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since there are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [10].
