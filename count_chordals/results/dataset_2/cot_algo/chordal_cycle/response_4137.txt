Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (1, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 5, 6, 9, 13, 0, 8, 1, 3, 14, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 8, 13, 9, 6, 5, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 10, 9, 6, 5, 7, 8, 13, 3, 1, 10)
- Cycle 4: (4, 10, 1, 8, 7, 5, 6, 9, 13, 0, 3, 14)
- Cycle 5: (4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 9, 6, 12, 2, 14, 3, 0)
- Cycle 7: (4, 11, 10, 9, 6, 5, 7, 8, 13, 0, 3, 1)
- Cycle 8: (7, 4, 10, 9, 6, 5, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 8, 13, 9, 6, 5, 4, 10, 1, 3, 14)
- Cycle 10: (6, 9, 13, 8, 7, 5, 4, 10, 1, 3, 14)
- Cycle 11: (8, 7, 4, 10, 1, 3, 14, 5, 6, 9, 13)
- Cycle 12: (8, 13, 9, 6, 5, 4, 10, 1, 3, 0, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 9), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (3, 5), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (5, 9), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (5, 7), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, (5, 8), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, (5, 7), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, (5, 8), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, (5, 13), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <6, (5, 9), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <6, (5, 4), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <6, (5, 4), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <6, (5, 4), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <8, (7, 9), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <8, (7, 4), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <8, (7, 4), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <8, (13, 7), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <8, (13, 4), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <10, (1, 8), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <10, (1, 4), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <10, (1, 8), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 21: <10, (1, 13), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [21].
