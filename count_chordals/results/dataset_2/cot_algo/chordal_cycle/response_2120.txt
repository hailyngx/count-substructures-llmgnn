Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle 1: 5-9-2-7-5
2. Cycle 2: 5-9-10-4-5
3. Cycle 3: 5-9-3-1-5
4. Cycle 4: 5-13-7-2-5
5. Cycle 5: 9-10-2-7-9
6. Cycle 6: 4-10-2-8-4
7. Cycle 7: 4-6-13-7-4
8. Cycle 8: 7-2-10-8-7
9. Cycle 9: 7-13-6-14-7
10. Cycle 10: 2-10-8-14-2
11. Cycle 11: 3-1-0-2-3
12. Cycle 12: 8-3-12-11-8
13. Cycle 13: 13-7-1-14-13
14. Cycle 14: 6-13-7-11-6

Step 2:
- After analyzing each cycle, we find that Cycle 1, Cycle 4, Cycle 9, and Cycle 13 have exactly one chord.

Step 3:
- Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <5, 9, (2, 7), 5>
2. <5, 13, (7, 2), 5>
3. <5, 9, (3, 1), 5>
4. <13, 7, (1, 14), 13>
