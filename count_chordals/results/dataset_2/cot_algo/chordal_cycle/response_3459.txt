Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 11) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

         <10, 6, 7, 8> 
         <10, 6, 1, 4>

         <1, 4, 0, 5> 
         <1, 4, 8, 12> 
         <1, 4, 14, 10> 
         <1, 11, 9, 5> 
         <1, 11, 13, 7> 
         <1, 10, 6, 7> 
         <1, 10, 12, 8> 
         <6, 7, 8, 12>

         <14, 5, 13, 7> 
         <14, 4, 0, 5> 

    Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

      <5, 9, 3, 11> has chord <9, 3>
      <5, 13, 11, 9> has chord <13, 11>
      <5, 0, 4, 1> has chord <0, 1>
      <5, 0, 4, 14> has chord <0, 14>
      <5, 14, 10, 1> has chord <14, 1>
      <9, 11, 3, 4> has chord <11, 4>
      <9, 12, 10, 14> has chord <12, 14>
      <4, 8, 12, 10> has chord <8, 10>
      <7, 6, 10, 12> has chord <6, 12>
      <10, 6, 7, 8> has chord <6, 8>
      <11, 13, 7, 6> has chord <13, 6>
      <8, 4, 1, 10> has chord <4, 10>
      <13, 7, 6, 10> has chord <7, 10>
      <3, 9, 5, 0> has chord <9, 0>
      <1, 4, 8, 12> has chord <4, 12>
      <6, 7, 8, 12> has chord <7, 12>
    
    Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are 16 chordless cycles found, so the final answer is [16].
