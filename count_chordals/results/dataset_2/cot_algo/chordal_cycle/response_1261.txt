Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 4 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 7 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 1 - 9 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 1 - 3 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 5: 5 - 1 - 6 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 6: 5 - 8 - 2 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 7: 5 - 8 - 6 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 8: 9 - 4 - 6 - 7 - 9
- Cycle 9: 9 - 4 - 0 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 10: 9 - 3 - 1 - 5 - 9
- Cycle 11: 9 - 7 - 6 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 12: 9 - 7 - 8 - 5 - 9
- Cycle 13: 7 - 6 - 4 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 14: 1 - 5 - 8 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 15: 1 - 5 - 9 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 16: 1 - 3 - 9 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 17: 3 - 9 - 7 - 6 - 3
- Cycle 18: 4 - 2 - 8 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 19: 6 - 7 - 9 - 1 - 6

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
From the list above, we can see that Cycle 9: 9 - 4 - 0 - 1 - 9 has one chord, which is (4, 1). 
So, there is one chordal 4-cycle <9, 4, 0, 1> with one chord (4, 1).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
