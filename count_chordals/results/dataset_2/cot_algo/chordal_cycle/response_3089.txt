Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (18, 4) (18, 27) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 25) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 24) (6, 24) (6, 20) (4, 18) (4, 10) (0, 22) (0, 15) (14, 8) (14, 27) (14, 13) (21, 28) (21, 8) (21, 29) (21, 17) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 2) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 24) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 16) (16, 28) (16, 26) (16, 7) (16, 20) (19, 5) (19, 23) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 12) (29, 21) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 25) (17, 21) (17, 13) (17, 2) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 20) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 13) (24, 11) (23, 26) (23, 19) (11, 1) (11, 22) (11, 24) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 21) (20, 6) (20, 16) (20, 7) (12, 9) (12, 15) (2, 3) (2, 28) (2, 9) (2, 17) (15, 0) (15, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 27) (10, 25) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 10) (25, 22) (25, 29) (25, 10) 

Response:
Step 1:  
There are several cycles of length 4 in the given graph:  
- Cycle 1: 1-3-10-4-1  
- Cycle 2: 1-3-8-14-1  
- Cycle 3: 1-5-19-23-1  
- Cycle 4: 1-9-2-17-1  
- Cycle 5: 1-11-24-5-1  
- Cycle 6: 1-9-12-15-1  
- Cycle 7: 3-2-28-21-3  
- Cycle 8: 3-8-14-13-3  
- Cycle 9: 3-10-27-18-3  
- Cycle 10: 3-8-21-17-3  
- Cycle 11: 4-18-27-14-4  
- Cycle 12: ... (and so on)

Step 2:  
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:  
- Cycle 1 has chord (3, 4)  
- Cycle 2 has chord (3, 14)  
- Cycle 3 has chord (5, 1)  
- Cycle 4 has chord (9, 17)  
- Cycle 5 has chord (11, 24)  
- Cycle 6 has chord (9, 12)  
- Cycle 7 has chord (2, 21)  
- Cycle 8 has chord (8, 13)  
- Cycle 9 has no chords  
- Cycle 10 has chord (3, 21)  
- Cycle 11 has chord (14, 27)  
- Cycle 12 has ... (and so on)

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph are:  
<1, (3, 4), 10)>  
<1, (3, 14), 8)>  
<1, (5, 1), 19)>  
<1, (9, 17), 2)>  
<1, (11, 24), 5)>  
<1, (9, 12), 15)>  
<3, (2, 21), 28)>  
<4, (14, 27), 18)>
