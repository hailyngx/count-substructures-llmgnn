Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 8, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 3, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (7, 8, 2, 9, 5, 4, 7)
- Cycle 4: (7, 1, 2, 8, 6, 3, 7)
- Cycle 5: (0, 3, 6, 8, 9, 5, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 5, 4, 6, 3, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Checking Cycle 1: (5, 2) is the only chord in cycle 1.
- Checking Cycle 2: (9, 6) is the only chord in cycle 2.
- Checking Cycle 3: (8, 5) is the only chord in cycle 3.
- Checking Cycle 4: (1, 8) is the only chord in cycle 4.
- Checking Cycle 5: (3, 6) is the only chord in cycle 5.
- Checking Cycle 6: (5, 6) is the only chord in cycle 6.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Final Answer: [6]
Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- Cycle 1: <1, (5, 2), 6>
- Cycle 2: <2, (9, 6), 5>
- Cycle 3: <3, (8, 5), 7>
- Cycle 4: <4, (1, 8), 3>
- Cycle 5: <5, (3, 6), 4>
- Cycle 6: <6, (5, 6), 0>
