Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 16) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 2) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 14) (18, 7) (0, 16) (14, 18) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 7) (15, 1) (15, 2) (15, 16) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 7) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 19) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 12) (7, 18) (7, 13) (7, 16) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 19) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-16-5
- Cycle 2: 5-13-7-18-14-4-1-3-5
- Cycle 3: 5-16-15-2-17-8-11-10-12-6
- Cycle 4: 5-3-2-17-8-11-10-12-19-7-13-5
- Cycle 5: 9-6-4-1-3-2-17-8-11-10-12-19-7-13-9
- Cycle 6: 6-4-14-18-7-13-5-16-6

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord (5, 16) -> Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (5, 16), 9, 6>
- Cycle 2: Chord (7, 18) -> Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, (7, 18), 13, 5>
- Cycle 3: Chord (15, 2) -> Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (15, 2), 16, 5>
- Cycle 4: Chord (17, 8) -> Chordal 4-cycle found: <4, (17, 8), 11, 10>
- Cycle 5: Chord (4, 1) -> Chordal 4-cycle found: <5, (4, 1), 3, 2>
- Cycle 6: Chord (14, 4) -> Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (14, 4), 6, 13>

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6].
