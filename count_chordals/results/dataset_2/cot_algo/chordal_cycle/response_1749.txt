Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 6) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 5) (18, 2) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (3, 11) (3, 4) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 17) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 7) (17, 13) (17, 1) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 14) (12, 1) (12, 4) (0, 9) (0, 6) (16, 15) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 19) (14, 4) (19, 4) (19, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 10, 6)
        - Cycle 2: (11, 3, 4, 12)
        - Cycle 3: (13, 17, 1, 11)
        - Cycle 4: (15, 4, 12, 1)
        - Cycle 5: (7, 15, 10, 6)
        - Cycle 6: (19, 7, 1, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 10, 6) has the chord (9, 6)
        - Cycle 2: (11, 3, 4, 12) has no chords
        - Cycle 3: (13, 17, 1, 11) has the chord (13, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (15, 4, 12, 1) has the chord (4, 15)
        - Cycle 5: (7, 15, 10, 6) has the chord (15, 10)
        - Cycle 6: (19, 7, 1, 11) has the chord (1, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <11, 3, 4, 12>
