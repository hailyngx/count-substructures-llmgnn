Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 15) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 18) (7, 16) (7, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 14) (1, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 18) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 15) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (18, 8) (18, 6) (18, 5) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (19, 9) (19, 15) (3, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 15) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (10, 8) (10, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 18) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 2)

- Cycle 27: (1, 14, 15, 16, 1)
- Cycle 28: (1, 5, 18, 6, 1)
- Cycle 29: (1, 5, 12, 13, 1)

- Cycle 31: (9, 17, 8, 18, 9)
- Cycle 32: (9, 17, 4, 6, 9)
- Cycle 33: (9, 13, 12, 5, 9)
- Cycle 34: (18, 8, 0, 3, 18)
- Cycle 35: (18, 8, 10, 2, 18)
- Cycle 36: (18, 8, 17, 4, 18)
- Cycle 37: (18, 5, 1, 14, 18)
- Cycle 38: (15, 16, 7, 9, 15)
- Cycle 39: (15, 16, 0, 3, 15)
- Cycle 40: (15, 16, 1, 5, 15)
- Cycle 41: (15, 16, 1, 14, 15)
- Cycle 42: (15, 16, 7, 9, 15)
- Cycle 43: (17, 9, 13, 12, 17)
- Cycle 44: (17, 9, 12, 5, 17)
- Cycle 45: (17, 9, 13, 12, 17)
- Cycle 46: (17, 2, 10, 8, 17)
- Cycle 47: (17, 2, 10, 8, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <1, (14, 15), 1>
- <2, (10, 8), 17>
- <5, (12, 13), 1>
- <6, (4, 17), 6>
- <7, (16, 15), 7>
- <8, (17, 4), 8>
- No chord found in Cycle 15
- No chord found in Cycle 19
- <9, (13, 12), 9>
- No chord found in Cycle 23
- No chord found in Cycle 24
- <10, (17, 8), 10>
- <13, (12, 5), 13>
- No chord found in Cycle 28
- <14, (1, 5), 14>
- <17, (8, 10), 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 6.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
