Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 6) (2, 16) (2, 8) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 19) (8, 2) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 13) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 13) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 0) (13, 6) (19, 18) (19, 3) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 6) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 14) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 3) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 7, 16)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 10, 12)
- Cycle 3: (1, 14, 9, 17)
- Cycle 4: (1, 13, 0, 15)
- Cycle 5: (2, 16, 12, 6)
- Cycle 6: (3, 4, 10, 12)
- Cycle 7: (3, 4, 7, 6)
- Cycle 8: (5, 9, 17, 1)
- Cycle 9: (5, 9, 18, 16)
- Cycle 10: (5, 0, 13, 1)
- Cycle 11: (5, 0, 15, 14)
- Cycle 12: (6, 13, 1, 4)
- Cycle 13: (6, 13, 0, 15)
- Cycle 14: (6, 7, 4, 10)
- Cycle 15: (7, 16, 18, 9)
- Cycle 16: (7, 4, 10, 3)
- Cycle 17: (9, 5, 15, 0)
- Cycle 18: (9, 5, 0, 13)
- Cycle 19: (9, 14, 1, 4)
- Cycle 20: (9, 17, 1, 13)
- Cycle 21: (10, 4, 1, 13)
- Cycle 22: (10, 4, 7, 6)
- Cycle 23: (10, 12, 16, 2)
- Cycle 24: (12, 16, 18, 9)
- Cycle 25: (12, 16, 2, 8)
- Cycle 26: (12, 10, 4, 3)
- Cycle 27: (13, 1, 17, 9)
- Cycle 28: (13, 1, 4, 7)
- Cycle 29: (13, 0, 15, 5)
- Cycle 30: (14, 1, 17, 9)
- Cycle 31: (14, 1, 4, 10)
- Cycle 32: (14, 15, 0, 13)
- Cycle 33: (15, 0, 13, 1)
- Cycle 34: (15, 0, 5, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 7), 16>
- <1, (4, 10), 12>
- <1, (14, 9), 17>
- <1, (13, 0), 15>
- <2, (16, 12), 6>
- <4, (10, 12), 3>
- <4, (7, 6), 10>
- <5, (9, 17), 1>
- <5, (0, 15), 14>
- <6, (13, 1), 4>
- <6, (13, 0), 15>
- <7, (4, 10), 3>
- <9, (17, 1), 13>
- <10, (4, 1), 13>
- <12, (16, 18), 9>
- <13, (1, 17), 9>
- <15, (0, 13), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
The total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [16].
