Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 15) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 13) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 15) (18, 16) (18, 11) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 11) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 2) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 16) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (1, 19) (1, 0) (1, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (4, 16) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 4) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 11) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 11, 6>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 11, 18>
- Cycle 3: <0, 8, 11, 6>

- Cycle 18: <4, 10, 16, 15>
- Cycle 19: <4, 13, 9, 5>
- Cycle 20: <4, 13, 14, 1>
- Cycle 21: <5, 9, 13, 19>
- Cycle 22: <6, 10, 4, 2>
- Cycle 23: <6, 10, 16, 15>
- Cycle 24: <6, 11, 0, 3>
- Cycle 25: <6, 11, 8, 1>
- Cycle 26: <6, 17, 12, 15>
- Cycle 27: <7, 2, 4, 10>
- Cycle 28: <7, 12, 15, 16>
- Cycle 29: <8, 0, 3, 11>
- Cycle 30: <8, 1, 19, 15>
- Cycle 31: <9, 5, 19, 15>
- Cycle 32: <9, 13, 4, 2>
- Cycle 33: <11, 0, 8, 1>
- Cycle 34: <12, 7, 2, 17>
- Cycle 35: <13, 4, 2, 17>
- Cycle 36: <13, 9, 5, 19>
- Cycle 37: <13, 9, 5, 19>
- Cycle 38: <13, 14, 4, 2>
- Cycle 39: <15, 12, 7, 2>
- Cycle 40: <15, 16, 4, 10>
- Cycle 41: <16, 4, 2, 7>
- Cycle 42: <16, 10, 6, 17>
- Cycle 43: <18, 11, 0, 3>
- Cycle 44: <19, 1, 0, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal Cycle 1: <1, 19, 13, 9>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <4, 2, 7, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [42] chordless cycles in the graph.
