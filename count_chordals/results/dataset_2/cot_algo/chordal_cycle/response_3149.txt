Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 6) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 11) (19, 15) (19, 12) (7, 14) (7, 18) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 19) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 18) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 10) (9, 1) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 18) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 1) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 1) (11, 8) (11, 17) (12, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (2, 8, 5, 13, 2)
- Cycle 2: (2, 16, 13, 17, 2)
- Cycle 3: (2, 3, 10, 16, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 4, 6, 10, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 0, 17, 13, 2)
- Cycle 6: (8, 5, 15, 17, 8)
- Cycle 7: (8, 11, 17, 0, 8)
- Cycle 8: (5, 14, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 13, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 10: (13, 17, 15, 19, 13)
- Cycle 11: (13, 6, 10, 16, 13)
- Cycle 12: (17, 15, 19, 12, 17)
- Cycle 13: (19, 15, 5, 8, 19)
- Cycle 14: (7, 14, 1, 9, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 18, 3, 10, 7)
- Cycle 16: (16, 13, 6, 4, 16)
- Cycle 17: (15, 5, 8, 11, 15)
- Cycle 18: (3, 2, 16, 10, 3)
- Cycle 19: (3, 0, 17, 15, 3)
- Cycle 20: (0, 2, 16, 10, 0)
- Cycle 21: (0, 17, 15, 19, 0)
- Cycle 22: (4, 6, 13, 17, 4)
- Cycle 23: (6, 10, 16, 2, 6)
- Cycle 24: (9, 1, 14, 7, 9)
- Cycle 25: (1, 0, 17, 13, 1)
- Cycle 26: (1, 18, 7, 14, 1)
- Cycle 27: (14, 5, 8, 11, 14)
- Cycle 28: (18, 7, 14, 5, 18)
- Cycle 29: (11, 8, 5, 13, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (4, 6), 9, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (3, 10), 16, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (6, 4), 13, 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, (11, 17), 5, 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <15, (17, 19), 5, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 29 cycles and 5 of them are chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles is 29 - 5 = 24.

So, the final count is [24].
