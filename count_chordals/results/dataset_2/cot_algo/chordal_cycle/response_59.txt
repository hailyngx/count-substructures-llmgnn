Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 5) (11, 8) (12, 10) (27, 26) (27, 19) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 22) (29, 28) (29, 25) (29, 13) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (3, 11) (3, 23) (3, 19) (16, 28) (16, 8) (26, 27) (26, 5) (26, 20) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 25) (21, 10) (21, 25) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 8) (15, 1) (15, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 26) (6, 19) (6, 20) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 22) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 22) (25, 10) (25, 29) (25, 23) (25, 21) (20, 26) (20, 6) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (19, 27) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (13, 29) (13, 15) (24, 1) (24, 17) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 7) (14, 4) (14, 23) (22, 28) (22, 17) (22, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

There are several cycles in the graph, but let's focus on cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 10-1-15-13-10
- Cycle 2: 11-3-19-27-11
- Cycle 3: 12-10-25-29-12
- Cycle 4: 25-10-21-25
- Cycle 5: 4-18-17-0-4
- Cycle 6: 4-5-26-20-4
- Cycle 7: 11-3-23-25-11
- Cycle 8: 1-10-25-21-1
- Cycle 9: 2-4-18-17-2
- Cycle 10: 2-4-5-26-2
- Cycle 11: 2-19-3-11-2
- Cycle 12: 2-19-6-20-2
- Cycle 13: 2-9-7-8-2
- Cycle 14: 19-27-26-5-19

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 4: 25-10-21-25, Chord: 25-21
- Cycle 6: 4-5-26-20-4, Chord: 5-20
- Cycle 8: 1-10-25-21-1, Chord: 10-21

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 11 chordless cycles found in the graph, so the number of chordal 4-cycles is represented as [11].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (10, 21), 25)>
<2, (5, 20), 4)>
<3, (10, 21), 1)>
