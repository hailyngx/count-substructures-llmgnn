Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
- No chordal 4-cycles can be formed as there are no cycles of length 4 or more.

Step 3:
- The number of chordless cycles found is 0.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
