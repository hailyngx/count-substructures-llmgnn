Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 24) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 24) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 18) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 26) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 12) (17, 20) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 27) (20, 17) (20, 26) (1, 15) (1, 8) (29, 9) (29, 19) (29, 21) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 21) (25, 9) (25, 17) (25, 27) (25, 18) (27, 3) (27, 17) (27, 25) (27, 23) (16, 21) (16, 10) (21, 29) (21, 13) (21, 16) (21, 2) (21, 24) (8, 1) (8, 22) (10, 4) (10, 16) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 23) (26, 2) (19, 15) (19, 29) (19, 11) (11, 7) (11, 19) (22, 8) (23, 4) (23, 27) (23, 26) (2, 21) (2, 26) (24, 5) (24, 9) (24, 15) (24, 7) (24, 21) (18, 7) (18, 25) (18, 12) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <5, 6, 4, 7>
2. <5, 14, 12, 3>
3. <9, 24, 15, 3>
4. <9, 25, 27, 3>
5. <3, 15, 24, 7>
6. <7, 4, 6, 5>
7. <7, 0, 13, 17>
8. <6, 4, 10, 16>
9. <15, 24, 21, 29>
10. <16, 21, 29, 19>
11. <21, 24, 7, 4>
12. <21, 2, 26, 6>

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <5, 6, 4, 7, (5, 4)>
2. <5, 14, 12, 3, (14, 3)>
3. <9, 24, 15, 3, (9, 15)>
4. <9, 25, 27, 3, (9, 3)>
5. <7, 0, 13, 17, (0, 13)>
6. <6, 4, 10, 16, (4, 10)>
7. <21, 24, 7, 4, (21, 4)>
8. <21, 2, 26, 6, (21, 26)>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [8].
