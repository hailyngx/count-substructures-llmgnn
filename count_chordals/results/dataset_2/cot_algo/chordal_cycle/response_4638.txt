Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 16) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 17) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 19) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 2) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 18) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 18) (16, 4) (16, 1) (11, 14) (11, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (2, 3, 6, 9)
- Cycle 2: (1, 15, 5, 18)
- Cycle 3: (10, 0, 1, 16)
- Cycle 4: (10, 12, 19, 13)
- Cycle 5: (8, 2, 3, 0)
- Cycle 6: (14, 5, 18, 13)
- Cycle 7: (14, 7, 10, 12)
- Cycle 8: (14, 11, 18, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (2, 3, 6, 9) has a chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 2: (1, 15, 5, 18) has a chord (15, 5)
- Cycle 3: (10, 0, 1, 16) has a chord (0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (10, 12, 19, 13) has a chord (12, 19)
- Cycle 5: (8, 2, 3, 0) has a chord (2, 0)
- Cycle 6: (14, 5, 18, 13) has a chord (5, 13)
- Cycle 7: (14, 7, 10, 12) has a chord (7, 10)
- Cycle 8: (14, 11, 18, 13) has a chord (11, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Thus, the final answer is [8].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <2, 3, 6, 9>, chord: (3, 6)
- <1, 15, 5, 18>, chord: (15, 5)
- <10, 0, 1, 16>, chord: (0, 1)
- <10, 12, 19, 13>, chord: (12, 19)
- <8, 2, 3, 0>, chord: (2, 0)
- <14, 5, 18, 13>, chord: (5, 13)
- <14, 7, 10, 12>, chord: (7, 10)
- <14, 11, 18, 13>, chord: (11, 18)
