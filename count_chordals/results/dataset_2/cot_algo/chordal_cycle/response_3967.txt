Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (9, 26, 17, 2, 14, 3, 15, 27, 29, 22, 10, 16, 25, 20, 3, 14, 2) with length 16
        - Cycle 2: (9, 26, 24, 0, 27, 29, 22, 10) with length 7
        - Cycle 3: (26, 24, 0, 12, 4) with length 5
        - Cycle 4: (26, 17, 2, 14, 3) with length 5
        - Cycle 5: (15, 27, 0, 24, 4) with length 5
        - Cycle 6: (15, 3, 25, 20, 25, 16) with length 6
        - Cycle 7: (15, 13, 21, 7, 18, 29) with length 6
        - Cycle 8: (15, 13, 12, 4, 14, 3) with length 6
        - Cycle 9: (27, 0, 23, 6, 19, 11, 28, 23) with length 8
        - Cycle 10: (0, 24, 4, 14, 3, 25, 16, 10) with length 8
        - Cycle 11: (18, 7, 21, 13, 12, 0) with length 6
        - Cycle 12: (22, 4, 14, 2, 17) with length 5
        - Cycle 13: (22, 10, 16, 25, 3, 14) with length 6
        - Cycle 14: (29, 18, 7, 15, 3, 25, 16) with length 7
        - Cycle 15: (13, 15, 3, 14, 4, 24) with length 6
        - Cycle 16: (8, 11, 19, 1, 5, 22, 29, 27, 15) with length 8
        - Cycle 17: (8, 19, 6, 23, 0, 27, 15, 7) with length 8
        - Cycle 18: (19, 1, 5, 16, 25, 3, 14, 2) with length 8
        - Cycle 19: (4, 12, 0, 27, 15, 3, 25, 16) with length 8
        - Cycle 20: (5, 22, 29, 27, 0, 24, 4, 14) with length 8
        - Cycle 21: (14, 3, 15, 7, 18, 29, 22, 5) with length 7
        - Cycle 22: (2, 14, 4, 24, 0, 23, 6, 19) with length 8
        - Cycle 23: (10, 22, 5, 16, 25, 20, 3, 15) with length 8
        - Cycle 24: (6, 19, 8, 11, 28, 23, 0, 12) with length 8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Cycle 2: (9, 26, 24, 0, 27, 29, 22, 10) has one chord: (26, 17)
        - Cycle 5: (15, 27, 0, 24, 4) has one chord: (0, 12)
        - Cycle 11: (18, 7, 21, 13, 12, 0) has one chord: (7, 15)
        - Cycle 12: (22, 4, 14, 2, 17) has one chord: (4, 24)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are 20 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph: [20]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <9, 26, 24, 0, 27, 29, 22, 10>
        <15, 27, 0, 24, 4, 14, 2, 17>
        <18, 7, 21, 13, 12, 0, 24, 4>
        <22, 4, 14, 2, 17, 26, 9, 23>
