Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 6 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 2: 4 - 1 - 3 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 5 - 3 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 4: 4 - 0 - 3 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 5: 7 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 6: 7 - 8 - 1 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 7: 6 - 9 - 3 - 4 - 6
- Cycle 8: 9 - 1 - 4 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 9: 1 - 3 - 5 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 10: 1 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 11: 3 - 4 - 5 - 2 - 3
- Cycle 12: 3 - 1 - 8 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 13: 5 - 4 - 0 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 14: 5 - 3 - 1 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 15: 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 16: 9 - 3 - 0 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 17: 1 - 4 - 0 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 18: 8 - 7 - 4 - 5 - 8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, 7, 1, 6> has exactly one chord (4, 1)
- <4, 1, 3, 9> has exactly one chord (1, 9)
- <4, 5, 3, 9> has exactly one chord (5, 3)
- <4, 0, 3, 5> has exactly one chord (0, 3)
- <7, 6, 9, 8> has exactly one chord (6, 8)
- <7, 8, 1, 6> has exactly one chord (8, 1)
- <6, 9, 3, 4> has exactly one chord (9, 4)
- <9, 1, 4, 3> has exactly one chord (1, 3)
- <1, 3, 5, 4> has exactly one chord (3, 5)
- <1, 6, 7, 8> has exactly one chord (6, 7)
- <3, 4, 5, 2> has exactly one chord (4, 2)
- <3, 1, 8, 5> has exactly one chord (1, 8)
- <5, 4, 0, 3> has exactly one chord (4, 0)
- <5, 3, 1, 2> has exactly one chord (3, 2)
- <6, 7, 8, 9> has exactly one chord (7, 8)
- <9, 3, 0, 4> has exactly one chord (3, 0)
- <1, 4, 0, 3> has exactly one chord (4, 0)
- <8, 7, 4, 5> has exactly one chord (7, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 18 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [18].
