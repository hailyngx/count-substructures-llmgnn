Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 3) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (6, 5, 0, 3, 6)  
- Cycle 2: (6, 5, 9, 12, 6)  
- Cycle 3: (6, 11, 4, 7, 6)  
- Cycle 4: (6, 11, 13, 3, 6)  
- Cycle 5: (6, 2, 0, 5, 6)  
- Cycle 6: (6, 2, 7, 10, 6)  
- Cycle 7: (6, 2, 11, 4, 6)  
- Cycle 8: (6, 2, 0, 1, 6)  
- Cycle 9: (6, 12, 9, 5, 6)  
- Cycle 10: (6, 12, 4, 11, 6)  
- Cycle 11: (6, 12, 10, 7, 6)  
- Cycle 12: (6, 14, 3, 13, 6)  
- Cycle 13: (6, 14, 10, 7, 6)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1: Chordless cycle  
- Cycle 2: Chordless cycle  
- Cycle 3: Chordless cycle  
- Cycle 4: Chordless cycle  
- Cycle 5: Chordless cycle  
- Cycle 6: Chordless cycle  
- Cycle 7: Chordless cycle  
- Cycle 8: Chordless cycle  
- Cycle 9: Chordless cycle  
- Cycle 10: Chordless cycle  
- Cycle 11: Chordless cycle  
- Cycle 12: Chordless cycle  
- Cycle 13: Chordless cycle  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 13 chordless cycles in the given graph.  
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<6, (5, 9), 12)>
