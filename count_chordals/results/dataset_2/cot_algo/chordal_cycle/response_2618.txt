Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 24) (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 13) (9, 19) (18, 26) (18, 14) (18, 24) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 21) (25, 3) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 1) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 29) (2, 12) (29, 2) (29, 19) (0, 15) (0, 6) (20, 21) (20, 4) (12, 2) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 26) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 23) (8, 11) (8, 7) (23, 8) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 28) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 21) (21, 6) (21, 22) (21, 20) (21, 11) (19, 9) (19, 29) (26, 18) (26, 27) (26, 17) (17, 23) (17, 26) (17, 16) (14, 18) (14, 22) (16, 17) (16, 4) (7, 8) (7, 23) (7, 10) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 28) (24, 15) (24, 18) (4, 20) (4, 16) (4, 28) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  

There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. Some of them are:  
- Cycle 1: 3-15-0-6-9-22  
- Cycle 2: 1-3-15-25-22  
- Cycle 3: 2-1-3-13-12  
- Cycle 4: 2-12-8-15-25  
- Cycle 5: 4-16-17-26-18-24  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- Cycle 1 does not have any chords.  
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (15, 22).  
- Cycle 3 does not have any chords.  
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (15, 8).  
- Cycle 5 does not have any chords.  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
There are 3 chordless cycles found:   
- Cycle 1: 3-15-0-6-9-22  
- Cycle 3: 2-1-3-13-12  
- Cycle 5: 4-16-17-26-18-24  

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].  
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:  
- <3, 15, 0, 6, 9, 22>  
- <2, 1, 3, 13, 12>  
- <4, 16, 17, 26, 18, 24>
