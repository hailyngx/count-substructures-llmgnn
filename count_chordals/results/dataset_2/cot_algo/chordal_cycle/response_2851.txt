Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0-3-4-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-7-9-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-5-6-0
- Cycle 4: 0-1-6-7-0
- Cycle 5: 0-2-9-7-0
- Cycle 6: 0-2-9-4-0
- Cycle 7: 0-5-4-9-0
- Cycle 8: 0-5-6-7-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: 0-3-4-8-0 has no chords
- Cycle 2: 0-3-7-9-0 has no chords
- Cycle 3: 0-1-5-6-0 has the chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 4: 0-1-6-7-0 has the chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 5: 0-2-9-7-0 has the chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 6: 0-2-9-4-0 has the chord (2, 4)
- Cycle 7: 0-5-4-9-0 has no chords
- Cycle 8: 0-5-6-7-0 has the chord (5, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 5 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 4, 8> (Chordless)
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 7, 9> (Chordless)
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 5, 6> (Chord: (1, 6))
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 6, 7> (Chord: (1, 7))
- Cycle 5: <0, 2, 9, 7> (Chord: (2, 7))
