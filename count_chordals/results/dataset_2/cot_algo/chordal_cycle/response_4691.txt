Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 22) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 7) (9, 27) (15, 27) (27, 5) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 4) (2, 3) (29, 7) (29, 14) (12, 16) (12, 26) (0, 5) (0, 20) (0, 21) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 18) (20, 24) (20, 28) (11, 28) (28, 20) (28, 11) (28, 8) (28, 17) (28, 22) (22, 5) (22, 9) (22, 28) (22, 4) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 24) (17, 23) (4, 5) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 23) (7, 9) (7, 29) (7, 1) (25, 26) (25, 19) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 23) (21, 0) (21, 13) (21, 8) (6, 24) (6, 3) (6, 8) (24, 20) (24, 17) (24, 6) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 23) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 6) (8, 18) (19, 25) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 16) (13, 10) (13, 21) (13, 14) (13, 18) (26, 12) (26, 25) (14, 29) (14, 13) (18, 20) (18, 8) (18, 13) (23, 17) (23, 4) (23, 10) (23, 16) (1, 7) (1, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- <5, 9, 7, 1>
- <5, 9, 27, 15>
- <5, 27, 15, 19>
- <5, 27, 9, 7>
- <5, 27, 9, 22>
- <5, 27, 4, 23>
- <5, 27, 4, 22>
- <5, 27, 15, 26>
- <9, 5, 27, 15>
- <9, 5, 27, 4>
- <9, 27, 15, 19>
- <9, 27, 15, 26>
- <15, 27, 5, 9>
- <15, 27, 9, 7>
- <15, 27, 9, 22>
- <15, 27, 4, 23>
- <15, 27, 4, 22>
- <15, 27, 5, 0>
- <27, 4, 5, 9>
- <27, 4, 9, 22>
- <27, 4, 23, 10>
- <27, 15, 19, 25>
- <27, 15, 26, 25>
- <2, 3, 16, 12>
- <2, 3, 6, 24>
- <2, 3, 6, 8>
- <2, 3, 16, 23>
- <9, 7, 29, 14>
- <9, 22, 28, 11>
- <9, 22, 28, 17>
- <7, 9, 22, 28>
- <7, 9, 22, 4>
- <7, 9, 27, 15>
- <7, 29, 14, 13>
- <27, 4, 23, 10>
- <27, 4, 23, 16>
- <27, 15, 19, 25>
- <27, 15, 26, 25>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <5, 27, 9, 22> has one chord: (5, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There is only one unique chordal 4-cycle: <5, 27, 9, 22>

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
