The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 11) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 16) (6, 9) (6, 15) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 22) (21, 7) (21, 11) (21, 2) (22, 7) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 24) (23, 22) (23, 15) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 4) (0, 14) (20, 27) (20, 11) (14, 0) (14, 27) (14, 15) (14, 5) (24, 26) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 18) (4, 17) (4, 27) (4, 16) (27, 20) (27, 14) (27, 4) (27, 11) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 7) (19, 22) (19, 5) (19, 28) (15, 6) (15, 23) (15, 10) (15, 14) (25, 29) (25, 12) (18, 13) (18, 24) (28, 8) (28, 17) (28, 19) (28, 12) (12, 13) (12, 25) (12, 28) (12, 16) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 2) (3, 5) (3, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (2, 21) (2, 16) (2, 3) (29, 25) (11, 9) (11, 21) (11, 20) (11, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (9, 26, 24, 22, 7, 21, 11)  (length 6)
- Cycle 2: (9, 26, 24, 22, 19, 7, 21)  (length 6)
- Cycle 3: (9, 26, 24, 22, 19, 28, 17, 10)  (length 8)
- Cycle 4: (9, 26, 16, 12, 25, 29, 25, 12, 16)  (length 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 26, 16, 2, 21, 7, 22, 24)  (length 8)
- Cycle 6: (9, 26, 16, 2, 3, 5, 19, 22, 24)  (length 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 26, 16, 4, 17, 10, 1, 8, 28)  (length 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 11, 21, 7, 22, 24, 26)  (length 7)
- Cycle 9: (9, 11, 27, 20, 11, 21, 7, 22)  (length 7)
- Cycle 10: (26, 16, 2, 3, 5, 19, 22, 24)  (length 8)
- Cycle 11: (26, 24, 18, 13, 8, 1, 10, 17)  (length 8)
- Cycle 12: (6, 15, 10, 1, 8, 13, 18, 24)  (length 8)
- Cycle 13: (6, 15, 14, 5, 3, 2, 16, 26)  (length 8)
- Cycle 14: (7, 22, 24, 18, 13, 8, 1, 10)  (length 8)
- Cycle 15: (7, 21, 2, 16, 26, 24, 22)  (length 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 21, 11, 9, 26, 24, 22)  (length 7)
- Cycle 17: (7, 22, 24, 26, 16, 2, 3, 5)  (length 8)
- Cycle 18: (21, 7, 22, 24, 26, 16, 2, 3)  (length 8)
- Cycle 19: (21, 11, 9, 26, 24, 22, 19, 7)  (length 8)
- Cycle 20: (22, 24, 26, 16, 2, 3, 5, 14)  (length 8)
- Cycle 21: (22, 19, 5, 3, 2, 16, 26, 24)  (length 8)
- Cycle 22: (22, 19, 7, 21, 11, 27, 20, 14)  (length 8)
- Cycle 23: (22, 24, 18, 13, 8, 1, 10, 15)  (length 8)
- Cycle 24: (23, 15, 6, 9, 11, 21, 7, 22)  (length 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: <1, (24, 22), 21> 
- Cycle 2: <2, (24, 22), 21> 
- Cycle 3: <7, (26, 16), 10> 
- Cycle 4: <12, (29, 25), 16> 
- Cycle 5: <14, (19, 22), 7> 
- Cycle 6: <15, (16, 2), 24> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <1, (24, 22), 21>
- <2, (24, 22), 21>
- <7, (26, 16), 10> 
- <12, (29, 25), 16> 
- <14, (19, 22), 7> 
- <15, (16, 2), 24>
