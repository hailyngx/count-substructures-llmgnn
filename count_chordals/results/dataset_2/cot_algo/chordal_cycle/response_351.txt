The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 12) (7, 21) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 27) (21, 17) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 23) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 29) (8, 4) (8, 18) (5, 2) (17, 21) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 22) (29, 4) (0, 17) (0, 20) (0, 11) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 10) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 27) (11, 12) (28, 3) (28, 11) (28, 26) (28, 16) (26, 6) (26, 28) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 2) (25, 27) (16, 4) (16, 28) (16, 10) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 12) (10, 20) (10, 26) (10, 16) (10, 22) (27, 21) (27, 11) (27, 25) (27, 22) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 10) (22, 27) (23, 1) (23, 26) (23, 15) (24, 3) (24, 14) (24, 15) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 15) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 26) (14, 20) (14, 24) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 13) (15, 23) (15, 24) (15, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 2, 1, 3, 12, 9)
- Cycle 2: (6, 26, 2, 1, 3, 12, 9)
- Cycle 3: (7, 21, 17, 0, 20, 14, 24, 3, 1, 2, 9, 6)
- Cycle 4: (7, 21, 17, 0, 20, 14, 24, 3, 12, 9, 6)
- Cycle 5: (7, 21, 17, 22, 4, 8, 18, 15, 23, 26, 6, 9)
- Cycle 6: (7, 21, 17, 13, 3, 12, 9, 6, 26, 28, 16, 4)
- Cycle 7: (7, 18, 8, 4, 16, 10, 20, 0, 11, 27, 21)
- Cycle 8: (7, 18, 8, 4, 22, 17, 13, 3, 24, 15, 18)
- Cycle 9: (7, 18, 8, 4, 22, 27, 25, 27, 21, 17)
- Cycle 10: (1, 3, 12, 9, 6, 26, 23, 1)
- Cycle 11: (3, 13, 17, 22, 4, 8, 18, 15, 24, 14, 20, 0)
- Cycle 12: (3, 13, 17, 21, 27, 22, 4, 8, 18, 15, 24, 14)
- Cycle 13: (4, 22, 17, 13, 12, 9, 6, 26, 23, 15, 24, 14)
- Cycle 14: (4, 22, 27, 21, 17, 13, 3, 24, 15, 18, 8, 4)
  
Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (9)>
- <2, (26)>
- <7, (21)>
- <8, (18)>
- <15, (23)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
