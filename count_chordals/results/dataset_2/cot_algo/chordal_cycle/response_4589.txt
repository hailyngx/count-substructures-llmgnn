Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 11, 5, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 2, 13, 9, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 2, 9, 11, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 0, 6, 12, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 3, 4, 11, 1)
- Cycle 7: (3, 6, 10, 4, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 8, 14, 9, 3)
- Cycle 9: (7, 12, 9, 14, 7)
- Cycle 10: (7, 5, 8, 14, 7)
- Cycle 11: (12, 0, 6, 4, 12)
- Cycle 12: (5, 11, 9, 14, 5)
- Cycle 13: (13, 2, 9, 14, 13)
- Cycle 14: (5, 7, 12, 0, 5)
- Cycle 15: (3, 10, 5, 7, 3)
- Cycle 16: (1, 11, 9, 2, 1)
- Cycle 17: (12, 0, 1, 3, 12)
- Cycle 18: (8, 14, 9, 11, 8)
- Cycle 19: (6, 10, 5, 11, 6)
- Cycle 20: (6, 8, 5, 7, 6)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (3, 8), 5, 1>
- <1, 11, (5, 7), 1>
- <1, (2, 13), 9, 1>
- <1, (2, 9), 11, 1>
- <1, (0, 6), 12, 1>
- <1, 3, (4, 11), 1>
- <3, (6, 10), 4, 3>
- <3, (8, 14), 9, 3>
- <7, 12, (9, 14), 7>
- <7, 5, (8, 14), 7>
- <12, (0, 6), 4, 12>
- <5, 11, (9, 14), 5>
- <13, 2, (9, 14), 13>
- <5, 7, 12, 0, 5>
- <3, 10, 5, 7, 3>
- <1, 11, (9, 2), 1>
- <12, 0, 1, 3, 12>
- <8, 14, (9, 11), 8>
- <6, 10, 5, 11, 6>
- <6, 8, 5, 7, 6>

Step 3:
There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found. 
Therefore, the final count is [20].
