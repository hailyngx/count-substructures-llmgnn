Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 4) (3, 9) (3, 13) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 13, 5)
- Cycle 2: (6, 10, 14, 8, 7, 6)
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 11, 0, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 13, 4, 9, 3)
- Cycle 5: (1, 9, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 6: (0, 10, 6, 7, 0)
- Cycle 7: (14, 10, 11, 0, 1, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, (2, 5), 9>
- <2, (11, 0), 5>
- <3, (4, 9), 13>
- <4, (13, 3), 9>
- <5, (5, 9), 1>
- <6, (6, 7), 10>
- <7, (0, 1), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
