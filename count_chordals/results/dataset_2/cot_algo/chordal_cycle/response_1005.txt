Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle: 5-9-6-2-5
2. Cycle: 5-9-7-4-5
3. Cycle: 5-9-1-4-5
4. Cycle: 5-6-3-0-5
5. Cycle: 5-1-4-0-5
6. Cycle: 9-7-4-8-9
7. Cycle: 4-8-6-2-4
8. Cycle: 6-2-8-0-6
9. Cycle: 9-5-7-4-9
10. Cycle: 7-4-8-6-7
11. Cycle: 1-5-7-4-1

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle 5-9-6-2-5 has no chord.
2. Cycle 5-9-7-4-5 has a chord <5, 4>.
3. Cycle 5-9-1-4-5 has a chord <9, 1>.
4. Cycle 5-6-3-0-5 has no chord.
5. Cycle 5-1-4-0-5 has a chord <5, 4>.
6. Cycle 9-7-4-8-9 has a chord <7, 8>.
7. Cycle 4-8-6-2-4 has no chord.
8. Cycle 6-2-8-0-6 has no chord.
9. Cycle 9-5-7-4-9 has a chord <5, 7>.
10. Cycle 7-4-8-6-7 has no chord.
11. Cycle 1-5-7-4-1 has a chord <5, 7>.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, (9, 1), 9>
<5, (5, 4), 9>
<9, (7, 8), 4>
<1, (5, 7), 4>
<5, (5, 7), 1>
