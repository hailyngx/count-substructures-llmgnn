Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 4) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 4, 13, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 12, 13, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 12, 1, 7, 14, 6, 10, 1, 12, 9, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 12, 1, 2, 11, 6, 14, 7, 1, 12, 9, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 0, 11, 14, 7, 8, 6, 10, 1, 2, 11, 0, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 2, 1, 7, 14, 3, 13, 12, 9, 6, 11, 0, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 2, 1, 7, 14, 3, 11, 6, 4, 13, 12, 9, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- None of the cycles listed above have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 7 chordless cycles found. 

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
