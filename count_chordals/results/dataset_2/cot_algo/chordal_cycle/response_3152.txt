Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
        - Cycle 1: 1-7-9-1
        - Cycle 2: 1-9-7-2
        - Cycle 3: 1-9-5-6-1
        - Cycle 4: 1-9-7-4-0-1
        - Cycle 5: 1-3-9-7-1
        - Cycle 6: 1-3-9-5-6-1
        - Cycle 7: 1-3-9-7-2-6-1
        - Cycle 8: 1-6-5-8-1
        - Cycle 9: 1-6-5-9-7-1
        - Cycle 10: 1-6-2-7-9-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 4 <1, 7>: (7, 9) is a chord
        - Cycle 7 <1, 5>: (5, 9) is a chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        - <1, 7, 9, 1> with chord (7, 9)
        - <1, 3, 9, 5, 6, 1> with chord (5, 9)
