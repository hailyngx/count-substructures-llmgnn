Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (0, 5) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 19) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 7) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 15) (2, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 15) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 18) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 10) (14, 6) (1, 16) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

1. Cycle 1: 3-10-17-7-11-13-4-8-15-2-17-10-3
2. Cycle 2: 3-10-14-6-15-2-17-7-11-13-4-8-6-14-10-17-3
3. Cycle 3: 5-9-17-7-11-13-4-8-15-2-17-9-5
4. Cycle 4: 5-9-16-1-12-0-5
5. Cycle 5: 5-9-16-19-6-14-10-17-2-15-8-4-13-11-7-18-19

Step 2: Checking for chords in the identified cycles:

- Cycle 1 has a chord: <3, 17>
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <6, 14>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <5, 17>
- Cycle 4 does not have any chords.
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <16, 6>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<3, 17, 7, 11>
<5, 9, 16, 1>
