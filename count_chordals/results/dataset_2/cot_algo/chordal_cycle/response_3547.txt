Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 4) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 2) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 12) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 15) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 4) (8, 17) (8, 10) (6, 2) (7, 18) (7, 13) (7, 15) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 7) (9, 14) (9, 16) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 19) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 19) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <1, 11, 2, 3, 1>
2. Cycle <1, 11, 2, 6, 10, 8, 17, 13, 1>
3. Cycle <1, 11, 15, 7, 13, 4, 1>
4. Cycle <1, 12, 18, 7, 15, 11, 1>
5. Cycle <2, 3, 1, 11, 15, 7, 18, 12, 2>
6. Cycle <4, 13, 1, 11, 15, 7, 18, 12, 4>
7. Cycle <4, 5, 18, 7, 15, 11, 13, 4>
8. Cycle <8, 17, 13, 4, 18, 7, 15, 11, 8>
9. Cycle <10, 2, 3, 1, 13, 7, 18, 12, 10>
10. Cycle <16, 17, 13, 1, 11, 15, 7, 18, 16>
11. Cycle <16, 9, 14, 4, 13, 7, 15, 11, 16>
12. Cycle <19, 0, 4, 13, 7, 15, 11, 2, 19>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

1. <1, 11, 15, 7, 13, 4, 1> has a chord: (1, 4)
2. <1, 12, 18, 7, 15, 11, 1> has a chord: (1, 18)
3. <4, 5, 18, 7, 15, 11, 13, 4> has a chord: (4, 18)
4. <16, 9, 14, 4, 13, 7, 15, 11, 16> has a chord: (9, 14)

Step 3: Counting the number of unique chordless 4-cycles: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 11, 2, 3>
<1, 11, 2, 6>
<1, 11, 13, 7>
<2, 3, 1, 11>
<8, 17, 13, 4>
<10, 2, 3, 1>
<16, 17, 13, 1>
<19, 0, 4, 13>
