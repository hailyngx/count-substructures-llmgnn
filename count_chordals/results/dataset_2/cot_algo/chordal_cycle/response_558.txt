- Cycle 45: {14, 9, 8, 2}
- Cycle 46: {16, 3, 1, 2}
- Cycle 47: {16, 13, 14, 6}

Step 2: 
Among these cycles, there are some chords:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 15), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (3, 17), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <10, (3, 17), 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <16, (3, 16), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <13, (15, 4), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <18, (17, 1), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, (17, 3), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8:<0, (11, 12), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <6, (14, 13), 15>

Step 3: 
The number of chordless cycles found in the graph is [38].
