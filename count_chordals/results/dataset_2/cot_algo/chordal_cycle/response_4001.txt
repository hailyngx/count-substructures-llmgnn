Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 12) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (6, 4, 7, 3)
- Cycle 2: (9, 10, 11, 1)
- Cycle 3: (9, 13, 3, 4)
- Cycle 4: (9, 14, 5, 12, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 2 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (13, 4).
- Cycle 4 does not have a chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

As there is only one cycle (Cycle 3) with exactly one chord, the count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <3, (13, 4)> for the cycle (9, 13, 3, 4).
