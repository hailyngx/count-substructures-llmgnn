Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Chordal 4-cycles:
          <7, 23, 4, 1>
          <7, 23, 19, 15>
          <22, 23, 7, 24>
          <13, 14, 9, 1>
          <26, 28, 24, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

        There are [5] chordal 4-cycles found.
