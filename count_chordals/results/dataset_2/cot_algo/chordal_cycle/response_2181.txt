Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 16) (2, 5) (2, 29) (2, 27) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 25) (29, 3) (3, 29) (3, 0) (3, 8) (25, 29) (25, 26) (25, 28) (10, 17) (10, 26) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 11) (17, 7) (15, 5) (15, 20) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 23) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 23) (13, 20) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 11) (26, 25) (26, 10) (26, 13) (6, 14) (6, 18) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 28) (16, 8) (28, 2) (28, 25) (28, 16) (28, 27) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 1) (4, 15) (4, 27) (4, 1) (27, 2) (27, 28) (27, 4) (7, 17) (1, 8) (1, 4) (19, 29) (22, 20) (22, 12) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 13) (18, 6) (18, 23) (18, 24) (23, 20) (23, 14) (23, 18) (23, 24) (12, 22) (24, 17) (24, 18) (24, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. 
- A few examples are:
    - (5, 9, 8, 3, 0, 14) with 6 nodes
    - (17, 24, 18, 23, 20, 15) with 6 nodes
    - (2, 27, 4, 1, 8, 3) with 6 nodes
    
Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - In cycle (5, 9, 8, 3, 0, 14), the chord (8, 3) is found.
    - In cycle (17, 24, 18, 23, 20, 15), no chord is found.
    - In cycle (2, 27, 4, 1, 8, 3), the chord (4, 8) is found.

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique Chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, 9, 8, (3, 0), 14>
- <2, 27, 4, (1, 8), 3>
