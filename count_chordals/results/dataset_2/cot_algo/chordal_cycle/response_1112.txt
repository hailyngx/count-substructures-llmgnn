Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 4) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 2) (1, 28) (1, 19) (3, 10) (3, 22) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 24) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 7) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 20) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 27) (6, 26) (6, 23) (6, 0) (28, 1) (28, 17) (28, 21) (21, 28) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 24) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 0) (19, 1) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 5) (18, 5) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 24) (2, 14) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 14) (23, 9) (23, 6) (23, 5) (23, 25) (23, 27) (27, 8) (27, 23) (27, 20) (29, 26) (7, 17) (7, 20) (7, 14) (20, 4) (20, 22) (20, 18) (20, 27) (20, 7) (13, 4) (13, 18) (15, 8) (15, 25) (25, 23) (25, 15) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 24) (24, 10) (24, 22) (24, 2) (24, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 4-26-6-0-4
- Cycle 2: 4-26-6-23-5-0-4
- Cycle 3: 4-26-6-0-5-23-6-4
- Cycle 4: 4-26-6-23-9-26-4
- Cycle 5: 4-26-6-0-16-2-10-17-28-1-19-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (6, 23)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (0, 5)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (9, 26)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (10, 28)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [0] chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <4, 6, 0, 26>
