Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 14) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 13, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 3, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 9, 10, 13, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 6, 2, 3, 10, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 3, 10, 12, 1, 6, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 14, 13, 10, 3, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 6, 1, 12, 5, 8, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord = (6, 7)
- Cycle 2: Chord = (8, 13)
- Cycle 3: No chord
- Cycle 4: No chord
- Cycle 5: Chord = (6, 2)
- Cycle 6: Chord = (10, 12)
- Cycle 7: Chord = (14, 8)
- Cycle 8: No chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found -> [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (6, 7), 4>
- <2, (8, 13), 4>
- <3, 2, 6, 4>
