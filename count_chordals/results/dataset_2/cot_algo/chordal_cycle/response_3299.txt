Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 2, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 4, 1, 0, 7, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 5, 2, 6, 8, 3)
- Cycle 6: (4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 4)
- Cycle 7: (5, 2, 6, 8, 9, 5)
- Cycle 8: (6, 1, 4, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 9: (7, 0, 1, 6, 2, 7)
- Cycle 10: (8, 0, 7, 5, 2, 8)
- Cycle 11: (8, 2, 5, 6, 1, 8)
- Cycle 12: (9, 3, 4, 5, 2, 9)


Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <1, (4, 7), 5> (Cycle 1)
- <1, (2, 6), 5> (Cycle 3)
- <3, (1, 7), 4> (Cycle 4)
- <3, (6, 8), 5> (Cycle 5)
- <4, (1, 6), 5> (Cycle 6)
- <5, (2, 8), 6> (Cycle 7)
- <6, (4, 5), 2> (Cycle 8)
- <7, (1, 6), 0> (Cycle 9)
- <8, (5, 2), 0> (Cycle 10)
- <8, (1, 6), 2> (Cycle 11)
- <9, (4, 5), 3> (Cycle 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 11 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final number is [11].
