Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle: 7-6-4-9-7
- Cycle: 7-9-8-5-7
- Cycle: 7-9-4-3-7
- Cycle: 7-3-6-4-7
- Cycle: 7-3-4-9-7
- Cycle: 7-4-2-6-7
- Cycle: 7-4-1-5-7
- Cycle: 7-1-5-8-7
- Cycle: 7-5-8-9-7
- Cycle: 7-8-5-1-7
- Cycle: 7-8-2-4-7
- Cycle: 7-8-9-0-7

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle: 7-6-4-9-7 <(4, 9)>
- Cycle: 7-9-8-5-7 <(8, 5)>
- Cycle: 7-9-4-3-7 <(9, 4)>
- Cycle: 7-3-6-4-7 <(6, 4)>
- Cycle: 7-3-4-9-7 <(3, 9)>
- Cycle: 7-4-2-6-7 <(4, 2)>
- Cycle: 7-4-1-5-7 <(4, 1)>
- Cycle: 7-1-5-8-7 <(1, 8)>
- Cycle: 7-5-8-9-7 <(5, 9)>
- Cycle: 7-8-5-1-7 <(8, 1)>
- Cycle: 7-8-2-4-7 <(8, 4)>
- Cycle: 7-8-9-0-7 <(8, 0)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle is:
- <7-6-4-9-7, (4, 9)>
- <7-9-8-5-7, (8, 5)>
- <7-9-4-3-7, (9, 4)>
- <7-3-6-4-7, (6, 4)>
- <7-3-4-9-7, (3, 9)>
- <7-4-2-6-7, (4, 2)>
- <7-4-1-5-7, (4, 1)>
- <7-1-5-8-7, (1, 8)>
- <7-5-8-9-7, (5, 9)>
- <7-8-5-1-7, (8, 1)>
- <7-8-2-4-7, (8, 4)>
- <7-8-9-0-7, (8, 0)>
