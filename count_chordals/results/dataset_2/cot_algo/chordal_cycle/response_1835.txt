Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 24) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 14) (25, 11) (10, 21) (10, 2) (11, 25) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 29) (17, 20) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 4) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (1, 17) (1, 26) (1, 15) (1, 13) (26, 25) (26, 1) (26, 7) (22, 23) (22, 5) (22, 24) (23, 11) (23, 22) (23, 0) (3, 11) (3, 19) (16, 2) (16, 28) (16, 9) (16, 27) (16, 6) (28, 17) (28, 16) (28, 27) (28, 4) (28, 24) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 27) (21, 8) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 29) (12, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (4, 17) (4, 28) (4, 0) (27, 16) (27, 28) (27, 21) (9, 16) (9, 21) (0, 23) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 16) (6, 0) (7, 26) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 29) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 29) (8, 21) (8, 29) (24, 20) (24, 22) (24, 28) (24, 14) (29, 11) (29, 15) (29, 13) (29, 5) (29, 8) (14, 25) (14, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (25, 20, 17, 1, 26) with edges (25, 20), (20, 17), (17, 1), (1, 26), (26, 25)
- Cycle 2: (25, 11, 3, 19, 15) with edges (25, 11), (11, 3), (3, 19), (19, 15), (15, 25)
- Cycle 3: (25, 11, 23, 22, 24) with edges (25, 11), (11, 23), (23, 22), (22, 24), (24, 25)
- Cycle 4: (17, 1, 26, 7, 25) with edges (17, 1), (1, 26), (26, 7), (7, 25), (25, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: (25, 20, 17, 1, 26) has chord (17, 1)
- Cycle 2: (25, 11, 3, 19, 15) has chord (11, 19)
- Cycle 3: (25, 11, 23, 22, 24) has chord (11, 22)
- Cycle 4: (17, 1, 26, 7, 25) has chord (1, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. As there are no chordless cycles found, the final count is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <25, 20, 17, 1, 26>
- <25, 11, 3, 19, 15>
- <25, 11, 23, 22, 24>
- <17, 1, 26, 7, 25>
