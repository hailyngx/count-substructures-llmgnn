Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-0-3-4-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-7-0-3-2-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-7-0-8-6-5
- Cycle 4: 5-7-0-3-4-1-5
- Cycle 5: 5-7-0-3-2-5
- Cycle 6: 5-7-0-8-6-5
- Cycle 7: 5-7-0-8-6-4-5
- Cycle 8: 5-1-4-3-0-2-5

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 7, 5>: Chord (9, 7)
- <5, 9, 7, 5>: Chord (9, 7)
- <5, 9, 7, 5>: Chord (9, 7)
- <5, 9, 7, 5>: Chord (9, 7)
- <5, 7, 8, 5>: Chord (7, 8)
- <5, 7, 8, 5>: Chord (7, 8)
- <5, 7, 8, 5>: Chord (7, 8)
- <5, 1, 3, 5>: Chord (1, 3)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- [0] (No chordless cycles found)
