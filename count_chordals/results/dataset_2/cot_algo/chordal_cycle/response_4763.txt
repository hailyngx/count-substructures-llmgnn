Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the given graph, but we will focus only on those with 4 or more edges:
1. Cycle <1, 7, 6, 3, 1>
2. Cycle <1, 7, 11, 6, 1>
3. Cycle <1, 3, 6, 7, 1>
4. Cycle <1, 3, 4, 1>
5. Cycle <1, 4, 14, 1>
6. Cycle <1, 4, 3, 6, 1>

Step 2:
Checking for the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle <1, 3, 4, 1> has one chord: (3, 4)

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, 4, 3, 6, 1>, chord: (3, 4)
