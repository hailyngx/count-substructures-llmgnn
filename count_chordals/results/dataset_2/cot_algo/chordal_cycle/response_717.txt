Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <Cycle 2, (7, 20)> 
- <Cycle 3, (11, 23)> 
- <Cycle 4, (13, 25)> 
- <Cycle 6, (14, 23)>

- <Cycle 13, (25, 22)> 
- <Cycle 14, (14, 16)> 
- <Cycle 15, (22, 29)> 
- <Cycle 16, (8, 19)> 
- <Cycle 17, (22, 19)> 
- <Cycle 19, (1, 19)> 
- <Cycle 20, (13, 25)> 
- <Cycle 22, (9, 27)> 
- <Cycle 23, (20, 7)> 
- <Cycle 24, (18, 4)> 
- <Cycle 26, (4, 18)> 
- <Cycle 29, (14, 10)>
- <Cycle 31, (9, 29)>
- <Cycle 32, (18, 27)>
- <Cycle 33, (20, 5)>
- <Cycle 34, (7, 29)>
- <Cycle 35, (5, 25)>
- <Cycle 36, (5, 20)>
- <Cycle 37, (5, 21)>
- <Cycle 38, (10, 18)>
- <Cycle 39, (14, 6)>
- <Cycle 40, (5, 3)>
- <Cycle 41, (7, 11)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [21]
