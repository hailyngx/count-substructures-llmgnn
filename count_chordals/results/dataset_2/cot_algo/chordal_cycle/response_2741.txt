Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 14) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 7) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 0) (16, 17) (16, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 4) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 13) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 0) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 19) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 17) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 14, 6, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 10, 9, 3)
- Cycle 3: (15, 10, 9, 13, 15)
- Cycle 4: (10, 11, 6, 2, 10)
- Cycle 5: (2, 18, 0, 12, 2)
- Cycle 6: (18, 7, 2, 6, 18)
- Cycle 7: (7, 12, 0, 18, 7)
- Cycle 8: (16, 4, 17, 19, 16)
- Cycle 9: (1, 6, 11, 18, 1)
- Cycle 10: (9, 0, 12, 7, 9)
- Cycle 11: (14, 10, 15, 3, 14)
- Cycle 12: (17, 5, 3, 15, 17)
- Cycle 13: (4, 14, 6, 11, 4)
- Cycle 14: (19, 0, 18, 2, 19)
- Cycle 15: (13, 9, 10, 14, 13)
- Cycle 16: (5, 7, 2, 18, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (2, 10), 18>
- <2, (7, 6), 18>
- <3, (14, 10), 15>
- <4, (11, 6), 14>
- <5, (3, 15), 17>
- <6, (7, 12), 2>
- <7, (18, 0), 12>
- <9, (0, 10), 9>
- <11, (5, 15), 17>
- <14, (10, 15), 3>
- <16, (18, 2), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the answer is [16].
