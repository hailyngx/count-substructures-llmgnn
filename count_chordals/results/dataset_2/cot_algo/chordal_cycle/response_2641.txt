Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (4, 5, 8, 3, 4)
- (5, 4, 1, 7, 5)
- (6, 9, 0, 5, 6)
- (7, 4, 0, 9, 7)
- (1, 4, 7, 3, 1)
- (3, 2, 0, 9, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal cycles with exactly one chord:
- <(1, 7, 4, 5) (8, 3)>
- <(3, 2, 0, 9) (6, 7)>
- <(5, 4, 1, 7) (0, 9)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [3].
