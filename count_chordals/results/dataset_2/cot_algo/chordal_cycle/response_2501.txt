Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (9, 15) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 15) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 1) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 16) (6, 19) (6, 17) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 13) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 17) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 18, 15, 1, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 18, 10, 2, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 13, 2, 10, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 13, 7, 14, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 8, 11, 12, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 8, 3, 7, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 8, 7, 14, 5)
- Cycle 8: (7, 8, 3, 7, 8)
- Cycle 9: (7, 8, 11, 12, 7)
- Cycle 10: (7, 8, 5, 19, 7)
- Cycle 11: (7, 13, 4, 18, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 13, 2, 10, 7)
- Cycle 13: (7, 14, 11, 12, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 14, 12, 1, 7)
- Cycle 15: (10, 18, 15, 1, 10)
- Cycle 16: (10, 18, 4, 13, 10)
- Cycle 17: (10, 2, 13, 7, 10)
- Cycle 18: (11, 8, 5, 19, 11)
- Cycle 19: (11, 12, 1, 15, 11)
- Cycle 20: (12, 9, 15, 1, 12)
- Cycle 21: (12, 9, 15, 18, 12)
- Cycle 22: (12, 11, 14, 7, 12)
- Cycle 23: (13, 7, 8, 3, 13)
- Cycle 24: (13, 7, 14, 4, 13)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Identified chordal 4-cycle: {<1, (5, 19), 11>}

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

So, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
