Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 9, 6)
- Cycle 2: (4, 1, 0, 11)
- Cycle 3: (4, 6, 2, 11)
- Cycle 4: (4, 6, 11, 0)
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 13, 14)
- Cycle 6: (4, 11, 8, 5)
- Cycle 7: (4, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 8: (7, 9, 6, 2)
- Cycle 9: (7, 5, 8, 13)
- Cycle 10: (7, 13, 14, 2)
- Cycle 11: (7, 5, 0, 11)
- Cycle 12: (6, 9, 10, 11)
- Cycle 13: (6, 2, 14, 13)
- Cycle 14: (6, 11, 8, 13)
- Cycle 15: (9, 10, 8, 13)
- Cycle 16: (11, 8, 13, 14)
- Cycle 17: (11, 0, 1, 4)
- Cycle 18: (11, 0, 5, 7)
- Cycle 19: (8, 5, 0, 2)
- Cycle 20: (13, 14, 2, 5)
- Cycle 21: (0, 11, 8, 5)

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 9, 6) <(4, 9)>
- Cycle 2: (4, 1, 0, 11) <(1, 11)>
- Cycle 4: (4, 6, 11, 0) <(6, 11)>
- Cycle 6: (4, 11, 8, 5) <(11, 8)>
- Cycle 9: (7, 5, 8, 13) <(5, 8)>
- Cycle 10: (7, 13, 14, 2) <(13, 14)>
- Cycle 13: (6, 2, 14, 13) <(2, 13)>
- Cycle 15: (9, 10, 8, 13) <(10, 8)>
- Cycle 16: (11, 8, 13, 14) <(8, 14)>
- Cycle 17: (11, 0, 1, 4) <(0, 1)>
- Cycle 20: (13, 14, 2, 5) <(14, 2)>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
