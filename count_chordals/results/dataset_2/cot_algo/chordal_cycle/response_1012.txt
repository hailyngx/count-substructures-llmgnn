Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 1, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 6, 0, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 3, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 2, 9, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 2, 3, 1, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 2, 6, 0, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 0, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 6, 2, 0, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 2, 3, 1, 7)
- Cycle 10: (1, 7, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 3, 2, 9, 1)
- Cycle 12: (3, 9, 2, 7, 3)
- Cycle 13: (2, 7, 8, 5, 2)
- Cycle 14: (2, 3, 1, 4, 2)
- Cycle 15: (8, 5, 4, 0, 8)
- Cycle 16: (8, 2, 0, 6, 8)
- Cycle 17: (6, 0, 4, 1, 6)

Step 2:
- Checking for chords in each cycle:
    - <1, (3, 5), 4> has a chord (3, 5)
    - <2, (3, 9), 1> has a chord (3, 9)
    - <4, (0, 6), 5> has a chord (0, 6)
    - <5, (1, 3), 4> has a chord (1, 3)
    - <7, (2, 6), 8> has a chord (2, 6)

Step 3:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]
