Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 3) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 2) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (0, 3, 6, 5, 0)
- (0, 5, 4, 1, 0)
- (0, 5, 6, 11, 0)
- (0, 6, 11, 3, 0)
- (0, 6, 14, 12, 0)
- (0, 7, 9, 1, 0)
- (1, 4, 12, 14, 1)
- (1, 4, 5, 6, 1)
- (1, 9, 7, 0, 1)
- (2, 0, 5, 4, 2)
- (2, 0, 6, 11, 2)
- (2, 0, 7, 9, 2)
- (3, 5, 4, 9, 3)
- (3, 5, 6, 11, 3)
- (3, 6, 11, 8, 3)
- (4, 9, 7, 0, 4)
- (4, 9, 13, 12, 4)
- (5, 6, 14, 12, 5)
- (6, 11, 8, 12, 6)
- (9, 7, 0, 2, 9)
- (9, 7, 13, 1, 9)
- (11, 6, 5, 3, 11)
- (11, 6, 14, 12, 11)
- (12, 8, 11, 6, 12)
- (12, 8, 13, 4, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, (3, 6), 5>
- <0, (5, 4), 1>
- <0, (5, 6), 11>
- <0, (6, 11), 3>
- <0, (6, 14), 12>
- <0, (7, 9), 1>
- <1, (4, 12), 14>
- <1, (4, 5), 6>
- <1, (7, 9), 0>
- <2, (0, 5), 4>
- <2, (0, 6), 11>
- <2, (0, 7), 9>
- <3, (5, 4), 9>
- <3, (5, 6), 11>
- <3, (6, 11), 8>
- <4, (9, 7), 0>
- <4, (9, 13), 12>
- <5, (6, 14), 12>
- <6, (11, 8), 12>
- <9, (7, 0), 2>
- <9, (7, 13), 1>
- <11, (6, 5), 3>
- <11, (6, 14), 12>
- <12, (8, 11), 6>
- <12, (8, 13), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 24 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final answer is [24].
