Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. 5-9-1-4
2. 5-9-6-3
3. 5-9-8-4
4. 5-6-9-4
5. 5-6-3-1
6. 9-5-6-3
7. 9-5-4-8
8. 6-5-4-8
9. 1-9-6-3
10. 1-9-4-8
11. 1-3-5-4
12. 1-3-6-8
13. 4-5-9-6
14. 4-5-1-3
15. 4-9-5-6
16. 4-9-1-3
17. 3-5-9-6
18. 3-5-1-4
19. 3-6-9-4
20. 3-6-1-9

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle 1-9-6-3 has exactly one chord (1, 3).
- The cycle 1-3-5-4 has exactly one chord (1, 5).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, 9, 6, 3, (1, 3)>
<1, 3, 5, 4, (1, 5)>
