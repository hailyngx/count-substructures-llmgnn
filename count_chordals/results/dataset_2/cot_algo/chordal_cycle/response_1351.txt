Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 12) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 4-9-1-14-4
2. Cycle 2: 4-9-0-6-5-4
3. Cycle 3: 4-0-6-2-7-4
4. Cycle 4: 4-0-13-1-9-4
5. Cycle 5: 4-0-13-8-5-4
6. Cycle 6: 4-0-7-10-11-4

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. Cycle 2: 4-9-0-6-5-4 (Chord: 6-0)
2. Cycle 3: 4-0-6-2-7-4 (Chord: 2-6)
3. Cycle 4: 4-0-13-1-9-4 (Chord: 9-1)
4. Cycle 5: 4-0-13-8-5-4 (Chord: 8-5)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <4, 9, 0, 6> (Chord: (6, 0))
2. <4, 0, 6, 2> (Chord: (2, 6))
3. <4, 0, 13, 1> (Chord: (9, 1))
4. <4, 0, 13, 8> (Chord: (8, 5))
