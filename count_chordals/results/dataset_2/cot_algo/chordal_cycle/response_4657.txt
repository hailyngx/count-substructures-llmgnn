Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle with 4 nodes: (5, 9, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (5, 8, 2, 0, 5)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (5, 1, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (5, 0, 3, 9, 5)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (9, 6, 4, 8, 9)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (9, 3, 0, 1, 9)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (4, 7, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (7, 1, 0, 3, 7)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (6, 2, 8, 4, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle (5, 1, 7, 4, 5) has a chord (1, 4)
- Cycle (9, 3, 0, 1, 9) has a chord (3, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 7 chordless cycles found. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <5, (9, 8), 6)>
Unique chordal 4-cycle: <5, (5, 0), 8)>
Unique chordal 4-cycle: <9, (8, 4), 6)>
Unique chordal 4-cycle: <9, (6, 2), 8)>
Unique chordal 4-cycle: <9, (9, 3), 0)>
Unique chordal 4-cycle: <4, (7, 2), 6)>
Unique chordal 4-cycle: <7, (1, 0), 3)>
