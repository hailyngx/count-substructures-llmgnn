Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 10) (22, 29) (5, 25) (5, 4) (5, 28) (9, 20) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 24) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 21) (15, 11) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 0) (1, 27) (1, 7) (8, 23) (8, 29) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 21) (23, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 26) (18, 6) (18, 24) (18, 12) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 29) (20, 9) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 7) (7, 1) (7, 20) (7, 11) (12, 18) (12, 14) (19, 25) (19, 14) (19, 24) (17, 20) (17, 4) (21, 3) (21, 15) (21, 23) (21, 14) (16, 13) (16, 24) (11, 15) (11, 7) (24, 3) (24, 18) (24, 19) (24, 16) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 6) (28, 5) (28, 10) (0, 15) (0, 1) (29, 13) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 26) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 21) (14, 27) (27, 1) (27, 14) (27, 6) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 25) (6, 27) (4, 5) (4, 23) (4, 17) (10, 13) (10, 23) (10, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (1, 3, 21, 14, 2, 6, 25, 5, 4, 23, 8, 29, 26, 18, 24, 16) 
        - Cycle 2: (1, 7, 20, 15, 11, 7)
        - Cycle 3: (1, 27, 14, 19, 25, 5, 28, 10, 23, 4, 17, 20, 9)
        - Cycle 4: (2, 14, 21, 3, 1, 0, 15, 11, 7, 20, 17, 4)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 5, 25, 6, 2, 14, 19, 24, 3)
        - Cycle 6: (5, 4, 17, 20, 15, 0, 1, 3, 24, 16, 13, 29, 8, 23)

Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 1 has chord (3, 24)
        - Cycle 2 has chord (1, 20)
        - Cycle 3 has chord (5, 23)
        - Cycle 4 has chord (3, 0)
        - Cycle 5 has chord (5, 14)
        - Cycle 6 has chord (5, 16)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are no chordless cycles in this graph. Therefore, the final count is [0]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
        None.
