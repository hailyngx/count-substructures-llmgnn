Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 18) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 17) (12, 14) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 18) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 15) (4, 9) (4, 15) (4, 19) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (17, 16) (17, 12) (19, 4) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 2) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 8, 5, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 16, 18, 5, 11)
- Cycle 3: (11, 6, 9, 4, 15, 1, 8, 16, 11)
- Cycle 4: (11, 6, 9, 4, 15, 10, 7, 3, 8, 16, 11)
- Cycle 5: (16, 8, 1, 15, 10, 7, 3, 8, 16)
- Cycle 6: (16, 18, 5, 8, 1, 15, 10, 13, 0, 6, 11, 16)
- Cycle 7: (6, 9, 4, 15, 10, 7, 3, 8, 16, 18, 5, 11, 6)
- Cycle 8: (9, 4, 15, 1, 8, 16, 18, 5, 11, 6, 9)
- Cycle 9: (8, 1, 15, 10, 7, 3, 9, 6, 11, 16, 8)
- Cycle 10: (8, 16, 18, 5, 11, 6, 0, 13, 10, 15, 1, 8)
- Cycle 11: (5, 8, 1, 15, 10, 13, 0, 6, 11, 16, 18, 5)
- Cycle 12: (1, 15, 10, 13, 0, 6, 11, 16, 18, 5, 8, 1)

Step 2: Check cycles for exactly one chord:
- <Cycle 4, (4, 15)> has a chord
- <Cycle 6, (1, 10)> has a chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]
