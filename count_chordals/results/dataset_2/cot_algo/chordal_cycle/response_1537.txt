Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 13, 5)
- Cycle 2: (8, 9, 13, 8)
- Cycle 3: (10, 11, 8, 10)
- Cycle 4: (7, 8, 11, 7)
- Cycle 5: (12, 7, 2, 12)
- Cycle 6: (0, 10, 13, 0)
- Cycle 7: (14, 5, 9, 14)
- Cycle 8: (3, 4, 9, 3)
- Cycle 9: (6, 10, 0, 6)
- Cycle 10: (1, 8, 7, 1)
- Cycle 11: (2, 11, 8, 2)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (13, 8)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (11, 8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (11, 8)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (7, 2)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (10, 13)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (5, 14)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (10, 0)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (7, 1)
- Cycle 11 has a chord (2, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [11]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, 9, 13, (5, 9)>
<8, 9, 13, (13, 8)>
<10, 11, 8, (11, 8)>
<7, 8, 11, (11, 8)>
<12, 7, 2, (7, 2)>
<0, 10, 13, (10, 13)>
<14, 5, 9, (5, 14)>
<3, 4, 9, (4, 9)>
<6, 10, 0, (10, 0)>
<1, 8, 7, (7, 1)>
<2, 11, 8, (2, 8)>
