Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 6, 8)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 12, 7)
- Cycle 3: (5, 0, 9, 7)
- Cycle 4: (5, 8, 11, 3)
- Cycle 5: (5, 0, 13, 1)
- Cycle 6: (9, 0, 13, 1)
- Cycle 7: (9, 7, 12, 2)
- Cycle 8: (6, 8, 11, 3)
- Cycle 9: (6, 4, 12, 7)
- Cycle 10: (4, 8, 11, 3)
- Cycle 11: (4, 12, 7, 2)
- Cycle 12: (8, 11, 3, 14)
- Cycle 13: (8, 4, 6, 13)
- Cycle 14: (8, 5, 1, 13)
- Cycle 15: (7, 12, 2, 11)
- Cycle 16: (7, 9, 0, 13)
- Cycle 17: (12, 4, 6, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 4, (6, 8), 8>
- <5, 4, (12, 7), 4>
- <5, 0, (9, 7), 0>
- <5, 8, (11, 3), 8>
- <5, 0, (13, 1), 0>
- <9, 0, (13, 1), 9>
- <9, 7, (12, 2), 7>
- <6, 8, (11, 3), 6>
- <6, 4, (12, 7), 4>
- <4, 8, (11, 3), 4>
- <4, 12, (7, 2), 12>
- <8, 11, (3, 14), 8>
- <8, 4, (6, 13), 8>
- <8, 5, (1, 13), 8>
- <7, 12, (2, 11), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [15]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 4, (6, 8), 8>
<5, 4, (12, 7), 4>
<5, 0, (9, 7), 0>
<5, 8, (11, 3), 8>
<5, 0, (13, 1), 0>
<9, 0, (13, 1), 9>
<9, 7, (12, 2), 7>
<6, 8, (11, 3), 6>
<6, 4, (12, 7), 4>
<4, 8, (11, 3), 4>
<4, 12, (7, 2), 12>
<8, 11, (3, 14), 8>
<8, 4, (6, 13), 8>
<8, 5, (1, 13), 8>
<7, 12, (2, 11), 7>
