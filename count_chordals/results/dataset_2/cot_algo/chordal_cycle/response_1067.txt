Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 4, 7, 6, 9)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 4: (8, 6, 7, 1, 8)
- Cycle 5: (6, 7, 1, 2, 6)
- Cycle 6: (7, 1, 2, 5, 7)
- Cycle 7: (0, 9, 4, 7, 0)
- Cycle 8: (1, 7, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 9: (3, 5, 2, 1, 3)
- Cycle 10: (2, 4, 8, 0, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord (4, 2)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (8, 6)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (6, 1)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (7, 5)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (5, 2)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (4, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are a total of 10 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [10]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <5, 9, 4, 2> (chord: (4, 2))
2. <9, 4, 7, 6> (chord: (4, 7))
3. <4, 8, 6, 7> (chord: (8, 6))
4. <8, 6, 7, 1> (chord: (6, 1))
5. <6, 7, 1, 2> (chord: (1, 2))
6. <7, 1, 2, 5> (chord: (7, 5))
7. <0, 9, 4, 7> (chord: (9, 4))
8. <1, 7, 4, 9> (chord: (7, 9))
9. <3, 5, 2, 1> (chord: (5, 2))
10. <2, 4, 8, 0> (chord: (4, 0))
