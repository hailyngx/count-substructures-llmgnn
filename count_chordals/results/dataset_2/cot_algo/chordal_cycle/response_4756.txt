Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - The cycles with exactly one chord are:
            - <1, 9, 0, 5>
            - <0, 1, 14, 12>
            - <0, 3, 6, 5>
            - <0, 2, 7, 13>
            - <2, 0, 9, 7>
            - <0, 3, 10, 8>
            - <0, 1, 11, 9>
            - <3, 13, 7, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        - There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [8].
