Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 3) (26, 0) (3, 26) (3, 24) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 29) (15, 21) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 21) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 28) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 2) (21, 15) (21, 6) (21, 10) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 28) (16, 1) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 27) (28, 10) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 25) (13, 17) (13, 23) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 20) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 4) (25, 28) (25, 0) (25, 22) (0, 26) (0, 25) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 22) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 20) (23, 9) (23, 13) (23, 18) (7, 11) (7, 18) (24, 3) (24, 8) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 7) (12, 29) (20, 8) (20, 14) (20, 2) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 29) (29, 15) (29, 12) (29, 4) (27, 16) (5, 17) (22, 16) (22, 25) (22, 11) (2, 17) (2, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 9-26-3-4-9
- Cycle 2: 9-26-3-24-8-9
- Cycle 3: 9-26-3-18-7-11-19-9
- Cycle 4: 15-6-21-10-17-13-23-18-3-15
- Cycle 5: 15-1-16-22-25-28-10-21-6-15
- Cycle 6: 15-29-4-19-8-24-3-15
- Cycle 7: 15-6-21-10-14-20-8-9-6
- Cycle 8: 15-29-12-29-4-19-11-7-18-29

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <9, (3, 4), 26> with chord (3, 4)
- <9, (3, 24), 26> with chord (3, 24)
- <9, (3, 18), 26> with chord (3, 18)
- <15, (6, 21), 10> with chord (6, 21)
- <15, (1, 16), 28> with chord (1, 16)
- <15, (4, 19), 8> with chord (4, 19)
- <15, (6, 21), 10> with chord (6, 21)
- <15, (4, 11), 19> with chord (4, 11)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final count is [8].
