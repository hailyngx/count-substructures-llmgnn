Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 0) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 10) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 10) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 0
- Cycle 2: 0 -> 1 -> 8 -> 5 -> 0
- Cycle 3: 0 -> 13 -> 9 -> 11 -> 0
- Cycle 4: 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 2 -> 1
- Cycle 5: 1 -> 8 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1
- Cycle 6: 2 -> 7 -> 11 -> 14 -> 2
- Cycle 7: 3 -> 0 -> 13 -> 8 -> 3
- Cycle 8: 3 -> 12 -> 4 -> 10 -> 3
- Cycle 9: 4 -> 9 -> 11 -> 14 -> 4
- Cycle 10: 5 -> 0 -> 13 -> 8 -> 5
- Cycle 11: 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> 13 -> 6
- Cycle 12: 7 -> 6 -> 12 -> 4 -> 7
- Cycle 13: 8 -> 13 -> 0 -> 14 -> 8
- Cycle 14: 9 -> 4 -> 12 -> 7 -> 9
- Cycle 15: 10 -> 2 -> 5 -> 0 -> 10
- Cycle 16: 11 -> 9 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11
- Cycle 17: 12 -> 6 -> 7 -> 11 -> 12
- Cycle 18: 13 -> 8 -> 1 -> 0 -> 13
- Cycle 19: 14 -> 0 -> 1 -> 8 -> 14

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: No chord
- Cycle 2: No chord
- Cycle 3: No chord
- Cycle 4: No chord
- Cycle 5: No chord
- Cycle 6: No chord
- Cycle 7: No chord
- Cycle 8: No chord
- Cycle 9: No chord
- Cycle 10: No chord
- Cycle 11: No chord
- Cycle 12: No chord
- Cycle 13: No chord
- Cycle 14: No chord
- Cycle 15: No chord
- Cycle 16: No chord
- Cycle 17: No chord
- Cycle 18: No chord
- Cycle 19: No chord

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
