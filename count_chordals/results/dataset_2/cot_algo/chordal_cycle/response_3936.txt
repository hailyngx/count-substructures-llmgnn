Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 25) (14, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (4, 16) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 21) (7, 29) (7, 22) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 25) (6, 20) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 29) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 26) (22, 7) (22, 18) (8, 10) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 28) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 3) (21, 4) (21, 23) (21, 16) (21, 12) (21, 29) (2, 23) (2, 12) (2, 24) (12, 21) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (1, 14) (1, 29) (1, 13) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 18) (29, 21) (29, 1) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 15) (5, 15) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 15) (15, 4) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 25) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 27) (20, 28) (27, 9) (27, 20) (19, 17) (19, 10) (28, 18) (28, 23) (28, 20) (28, 13) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
Some cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (8, 0, 12, 21, 8)
- Cycle 2: (21, 4, 16, 3, 21)
- Cycle 3: (21, 4, 15, 24, 21)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (0, 8)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (16, 3)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (15, 24)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
