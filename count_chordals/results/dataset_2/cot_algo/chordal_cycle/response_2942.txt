Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the given graph are as follows:
1. (9, 5, 3, 0, 9)
2. (4, 7, 1, 0, 4)
3. (7, 6, 4, 2, 7)
4. (8, 9, 3, 0, 8)
5. (1, 4, 2, 7, 1)
6. (9, 8, 7, 4, 9)
7. (0, 1, 4, 6, 0)
8. (3, 5, 9, 2, 3)
9. (8, 7, 1, 0, 8)
10. (9, 2, 4, 6, 9)
11. (7, 1, 0, 3, 7)
12. (4, 2, 3, 8, 4)
13. (6, 7, 8, 0, 6)
14. (2, 4, 1, 7, 2)
15. (9, 3, 8, 0, 9)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <9, (5, 3), 0, 9>
2. <4, (7, 1), 0, 4>
3. <7, (6, 2), 4, 7>
4. <8, (9, 3), 0, 8>
5. <1, (4, 2), 7, 1>
6. <9, (8, 7), 4, 9>
7. <0, (1, 4), 6, 0>
8. <3, (5, 9), 2, 3>
9. <8, (7, 1), 0, 8>
10. <9, (2, 4), 6, 9>
11. <7, (1, 0), 3, 7>
12. <4, (2, 3), 8, 4>
13. <6, (7, 8), 0, 6>
14. <2, (4, 1), 7, 2>
15. <9, (3, 8), 0, 9>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [15]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<9, (5, 3), 0, 9>
<4, (7, 1), 0, 4>
<7, (6, 2), 4, 7>
<8, (9, 3), 0, 8>
<1, (4, 2), 7, 1>
<9, (8, 7), 4, 9>
<0, (1, 4), 6, 0>
<3, (5, 9), 2, 3>
<8, (7, 1), 0, 8>
<9, (2, 4), 6, 9>
<7, (1, 0), 3, 7>
<4, (2, 3), 8, 4>
<6, (7, 8), 0, 6>
<2, (4, 1), 7, 2>
<9, (3, 8), 0, 9>
