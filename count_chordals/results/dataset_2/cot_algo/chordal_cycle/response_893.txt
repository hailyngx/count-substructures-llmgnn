The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 7) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (13, 0) (13, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 9) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 12, 3, 0)

- Cycle 4: (0, 11, 7, 5, 10, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 13, 4, 12, 2, 0)
- Cycle 6: (1, 7, 9, 12, 2, 6, 8, 0, 4, 13, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 9, 7, 5, 10, 3, 14, 2, 12, 4, 1)
- Cycle 8: (2, 6, 8, 11, 7, 9, 12, 3, 10, 5, 2)
- Cycle 9: (3, 9, 1, 12, 4, 13, 0, 8, 6, 2, 14, 3)
- Cycle 10: (4, 0, 8, 11, 7, 5, 10, 3, 12, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 11: (5, 7, 9, 12, 4, 13, 0, 14, 2, 6, 8, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 10, 3, 14, 0, 13, 4, 12, 2, 6, 5)
- Cycle 13: (6, 2, 14, 0, 13, 4, 12, 3, 10, 5, 6)
- Cycle 14: (7, 5, 10, 3, 12, 9, 1, 12, 4, 13, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 9, 1, 5, 10, 3, 12, 2, 6, 8, 7)
- Cycle 16: (8, 6, 2, 12, 3, 10, 5, 7, 9, 12, 8)
- Cycle 17: (9, 1, 5, 10, 3, 12, 4, 13, 0, 8, 9)
- Cycle 18: (9, 7, 5, 10, 3, 14, 2, 6, 8, 11, 9)
- Cycle 19: (10, 5, 7, 11, 0, 13, 4, 12, 2, 14, 10)
- Cycle 20: (11, 0, 8, 6, 2, 14, 3, 12, 4, 13, 11)
- Cycle 21: (12, 2, 14, 3, 10, 5, 7, 9, 1, 4, 12)
- Cycle 22: (13, 0, 4, 12, 3, 10, 5, 7, 9, 1, 13)
- Cycle 23: (14, 0, 8, 6, 2, 12, 3, 10, 5, 7, 14)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is: 
<1, (12, 9), 7>

Step 3:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
