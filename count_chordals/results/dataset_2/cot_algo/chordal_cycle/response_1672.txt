Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 24) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 20) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 27) (11, 29) (12, 10) (12, 24) (12, 28) (27, 11) (27, 19) (27, 23) (0, 1) (20, 10) (20, 17) (20, 22) (28, 12) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 21) (29, 11) (29, 28) (29, 6) (29, 16) (6, 28) (6, 29) (6, 17) (6, 22) (8, 26) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 22) (21, 28) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 2) (1, 0) (1, 17) (1, 2) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 13) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 16) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 18) (26, 8) (26, 5) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 24) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 14) (15, 5) (15, 13) (2, 21) (2, 1) (2, 5) (23, 27) (23, 21) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 18) (14, 19) (14, 9) (14, 16) (16, 29) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 16) (22, 20) (22, 6) (22, 7) (22, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (3, 25, 24, 12, 10)
- (10, 11, 27, 23, 21)
- (12, 24, 25, 3, 9)
- (27, 11, 10, 12, 28)
- (20, 10, 12, 24, 25)
- (28, 12, 10, 20, 17)
- (29, 11, 10, 20, 17)
- (6, 28, 12, 10, 20)
- (17, 20, 10, 11, 9)
- (5, 13, 17, 20, 10)
- (13, 17, 20, 10, 11)
- (26, 8, 7, 22, 21)
- (18, 13, 17, 20, 10)
- (19, 27, 11, 10, 20)
- (15, 5, 13, 17, 20)
- (2, 21, 28, 12, 10)
- (23, 27, 11, 10, 20)
- (14, 19, 27, 11, 10)
- (16, 29, 11, 10, 20)
- (9, 3, 25, 24, 12)
- (22, 7, 8, 26, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, (9, 12), 25>
- <10, (11, 27), 20>
- <12, (10, 28), 24>
- <17, (13, 20), 10>
- <21, (22, 28), 10>
- <23, (11, 27), 20>
- <16, (11, 29), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are [19] chordless cycles in the graph.
