Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 25) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 8) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 22) (3, 8) (15, 20) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 29) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 4) (20, 19) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 2) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 2) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 7) (26, 20) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 25) (26, 17) (6, 22) (21, 10) (21, 23) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 12) (10, 21) (10, 19) (25, 0) (25, 27) (25, 26) (25, 19) (16, 1) (16, 13) (24, 1) (29, 27) (29, 15) (29, 5) (2, 15) (2, 11) (2, 28) (2, 9) (7, 13) (7, 19) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 29) (19, 20) (19, 10) (19, 25) (19, 7) (17, 26) (17, 23) (17, 4) (22, 3) (22, 28) (22, 6) (22, 12) (23, 0) (23, 21) (23, 17) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 22) (4, 20) (4, 17) (8, 27) (8, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <0, 27, 29, 8>
        - <1, 3, 8, 2>
        - <15, 20, 4, 17>
        - <11, 2, 28, 22>
        - <13, 26, 18, 5>
        - <7, 19, 25, 0>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - <0, 27, 29, 8> has chord (27, 8)
        - <1, 3, 8, 2> has chord (1, 2)
        - <15, 20, 4, 17> has chord (20, 17)
        - <11, 2, 28, 22> has chord (2, 28)
        - <13, 26, 18, 5> has chord (26, 5)
        - <7, 19, 25, 0> has chord (19, 25)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
        There are a total of 6 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Putting the final number inside brackets, the answer is [6].
