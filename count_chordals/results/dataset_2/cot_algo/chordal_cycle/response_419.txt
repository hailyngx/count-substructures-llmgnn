Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 0) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0)

- Cycle 5: (3, 9, 12, 8)
- Cycle 6: (3, 9, 12, 6)
- Cycle 7: (3, 1, 0, 4)
- Cycle 8: (3, 1, 0, 2)
- Cycle 9: (3, 1, 10, 13)
- Cycle 10: (5, 14, 4, 6)
- Cycle 11: (5, 14, 4, 12)
- Cycle 12: (5, 14, 3, 0)
- Cycle 13: (5, 12, 9, 3)
- Cycle 14: (5, 12, 4, 0)

- Cycle 20: (4, 7, 2, 8)
- Cycle 21: (4, 7, 8, 11)
- Cycle 22: (4, 12, 6, 13)
- Cycle 23: (7, 8, 11, 13)
- Cycle 24: (1, 10, 13, 6)
- Cycle 25: (0, 1, 3, 5)
- Cycle 26: (0, 1, 3, 9)
- Cycle 27: (0, 1, 10, 13)
- Cycle 28: (0, 4, 7, 8)
- Cycle 29: (0, 4, 7, 2)
- Cycle 30: (0, 4, 6, 13)
- Cycle 31: (0, 2, 7, 4)
- Cycle 32: (0, 2, 7, 8)
- Cycle 33: (0, 2, 13, 6)
- Cycle 34: (10, 1, 0, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 5, 12, 9> (Chord: (5, 9))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]
