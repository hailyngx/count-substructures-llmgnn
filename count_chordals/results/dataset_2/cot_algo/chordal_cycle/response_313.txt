Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 0-1-3-4-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-2-3-4-0
        - Cycle 3: 0-3-6-0
        - Cycle 4: 1-3-4-7-1
        - Cycle 5: 2-3-4-9-2
        - Cycle 6: 4-7-8-5-4
        - Cycle 7: 7-8-5-2-7
        - Cycle 8: 8-5-2-9-8
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - <0, 1, 3, 4, 0> has one chord 4-1
        - <0, 2, 3, 4, 0> has one chord 4-2
        - <4, 7, 8, 5, 4> has one chord 5-8
        - <7, 8, 5, 2, 7> has one chord 5-2
        - <8, 5, 2, 9, 8> has one chord 2-9
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [5].
