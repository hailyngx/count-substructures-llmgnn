Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 14) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 7) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-14-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-12-2-14-1
- Cycle 3: 3-5-0-10-3
- Cycle 4: 3-12-6-7-3
- Cycle 5: 8-9-4-2-8
- Cycle 6: 8-0-11-7-8
- Cycle 7: 10-0-11-7-10
- Cycle 8: 13-8-0-11-13
- Cycle 9: 13-2-4-14-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <1, (5, 14), 4, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
