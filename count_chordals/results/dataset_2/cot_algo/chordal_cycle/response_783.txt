Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (1, 12) (1, 2) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- 5-9-2-5
- 5-9-0-8-5
- 5-10-0-8-5
- 5-12-13-8-5
- 5-12-10-7-5
- 5-3-2-5
- 5-3-4-8-5
- 9-2-5-12-9
- 9-2-11-13-9
- 9-0-8-13-9
- 8-0-4-3-8
- 8-14-7-10-8
- 8-14-6-13-8
- 8-7-11-13-8
- 13-11-7-14-13
- 10-7-11-13-10
- 10-0-8-13-10
- 10-12-1-2-10
- 11-7-14-6-11
- 4-0-8-13-4
- 7-8-13-6-7
- 7-14-8-0-7
- 7-14-6-3-7
- 12-10-0-8-12
- 12-7-11-13-12
- 2-3-4-8-2
- 3-4-0-8-3
- 1-2-3-6-1
- 6-3-4-0-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 9, 2, 12> (Chord: (5, 12))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1].
