Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- The cycles in the graph are:  
<4, 7, 8, 9, 4>  
<4, 6, 2, 5, 4>  
<4, 6, 2, 1, 4>  
<4, 6, 3, 5, 4>  
<7, 8, 2, 5, 7>  
<7, 8, 2, 1, 7>  
<7, 8, 9, 6, 7>  
<6, 2, 5, 3, 6>  
<6, 2, 1, 4, 6>  
<9, 8, 2, 1, 9>  
<9, 8, 7, 4, 9>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- The chordal cycles in the graph are:  
<4, (6, 9), 7>  
<4, (2, 5), 6>  
<4, (2, 1), 6>  
<4, (3, 5), 6>  
<7, (2, 5), 8>  
<7, (2, 1), 8>  
<7, (8, 9), 6>  
<6, (5, 3), 2>  
<6, (1, 4), 2>  
<9, (2, 1), 8>  
<9, (7, 4), 8>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.  
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
