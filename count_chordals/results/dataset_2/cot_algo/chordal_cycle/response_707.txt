Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (5, 4, 7, 12)
2. (9, 8, 10, 11)
3. (4, 1, 9, 0)
4. (7, 11, 1, 14)
5. (12, 13, 0, 9)
6. (0, 6, 14, 7)
7. (2, 5, 4, 7)
8. (8, 9, 0, 13)
9. (1, 10, 6, 3)
10. (13, 14, 7, 4)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <1, (4, 7), 12>
2. <2, (8, 10), 11>
3. <4, (0, 9), 1>
4. <7, (1, 14), 11>
5. <9, (12, 0), 13>
6. <0, (6, 14), 7>
7. <5, (4, 7), 2>
8. <8, (0, 13), 9>
9. <10, (1, 6), 3>
10. <13, (14, 7), 4>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
