Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 13) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-10-2-5 (length 4)
- Cycle 2: 5-9-1-0-7-6-5 (length 6)
- Cycle 3: 4-7-11-14-4 (length 4)
- Cycle 4: 4-7-0-12-2-14-4 (length 6)
- Cycle 5: 4-11-14-2-10-9-4 (length 6)
- Cycle 6: 7-0-12-2-10-9-7 (length 6)
- Cycle 7: 7-4-13-1-6-3-7 (length 6)
- Cycle 8: 10-9-1-6-3-13-10 (length 6)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-10-2-5 has 1 chord (9-2)
- Cycle 2: 5-9-1-0-7-6-5 has 1 chord (9-6)
- Cycle 3: 4-7-11-14-4 has 1 chord (7-14)
- Cycle 4: 4-7-0-12-2-14-4 has 1 chord (7-2)
- Cycle 5: 4-7-11-14-2-10-9-4 has 1 chord (7-10)
- Cycle 6: 7-0-12-2-14-4 has 1 chord (0-14)
- Cycle 7: 7-4-13-1-6-3-7 has 1 chord (4-1)
- Cycle 8: 10-9-1-6-3-13-10 has 1 chord (9-6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 9, 10, 2, (9, 2)>
<5, 9, 1, 0, 7, 6, (9, 6)>
<4, 7, 11, 14, (7, 14)>
<4, 7, 0, 12, 2, 14, (7, 2)>
<4, 7, 11, 14, 2, 10, 9, (7, 10)>
<7, 0, 12, 2, 14, (0, 14)>
<7, 4, 13, 1, 6, 3, (4, 1)>
<10, 9, 1, 6, 3, 13, (9, 6)>
