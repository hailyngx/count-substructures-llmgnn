Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph. I will list them below:
1. Cycle: 0-5-4-7-0
2. Cycle: 0-1-8-6-0
3. Cycle: 0-4-8-6-0
4. Cycle: 0-6-5-8-0
5. Cycle: 4-5-6-8-4
6. Cycle: 4-7-6-8-4
7. Cycle: 6-9-7-3-6
8. Cycle: 6-8-2-7-6
9. Cycle: 6-8-1-0-6

Step 2: 
- Now, I will check each of these cycles for the presence of exactly one chord:
1. Cycle: 0-5-4-7-0 <(0, 4)>
2. Cycle: 0-1-8-6-0 <(0, 8)>
3. Cycle: 0-4-8-6-0 <(4, 8)>
4. Cycle: 0-6-5-8-0 <(0, 5)>
5. Cycle: 4-5-6-8-4 <(4, 6)>
6. Cycle: 4-7-6-8-4 <(4, 6)>
7. Cycle: 6-9-7-3-6 <(6, 7)>
8. Cycle: 6-8-2-7-6 <(6, 2)>
9. Cycle: 6-8-1-0-6 <(6, 1)>

Step 3: 
- Since all the cycles listed above have exactly one chord each, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 5, 4, 7> with a chord (0, 4)
<0, 1, 8, 6> with a chord (0, 8)
<0, 4, 8, 6> with a chord (4, 8)
<0, 6, 5, 8> with a chord (0, 5)
<4, 5, 6, 8> with a chord (4, 6)
<4, 7, 6, 8> with a chord (4, 6)
<6, 9, 7, 3> with a chord (6, 7)
<6, 8, 2, 7> with a chord (6, 2)
<6, 8, 1, 0> with a chord (6, 1)
