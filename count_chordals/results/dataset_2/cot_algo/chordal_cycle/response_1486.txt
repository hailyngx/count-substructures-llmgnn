Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (17, 1) (17, 6) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 19) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 13) (1, 17) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 16) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 9) (16, 3) (16, 6) (2, 13) (2, 9) (9, 14) (9, 2) (5, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 7, 8, 13>  (cycle of length 4)
- <0, 15, 5, 15> (cycle of length 4)
- <1, 13, 8, 12> (cycle of length 4)
- <1, 17, 6, 8>  (cycle of length 4)
- <1, 17, 6, 16> (cycle of length 4)
- <2, 13, 8, 12> (cycle of length 4)
- <2, 13, 19, 3> (cycle of length 4)
- <3, 11, 15, 5> (cycle of length 4)
- <3, 11, 15, 18> (cycle of length 4)
- <3, 14, 9, 2>  (cycle of length 4)
- <3, 16, 6, 17>  (cycle of length 4)
- <4, 18, 15, 0> (cycle of length 4)
- <4, 18, 6, 17> (cycle of length 4)
- <6, 8, 13, 2>  (cycle of length 4)
- <6, 16, 3, 11> (cycle of length 4)
- <6, 16, 3, 14> (cycle of length 4)
- <7, 0, 15, 11> (cycle of length 4)
- <8, 12, 14, 9> (cycle of length 4)
- <10, 11, 15, 18> (cycle of length 4)
- <13, 19, 11, 3> (cycle of length 4)

Step 2: List of cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, (7, 8), 13>
- <0, (15, 5), 15>
- <1, (13, 8), 12>
- <1, (17, 6), 8>
- <1, (17, 6), 16>
- <2, (13, 8), 12>
- <2, (13, 19), 3>
- <3, (11, 15), 5>
- <3, (11, 15), 18>
- <3, (14, 9), 2>
- <3, (16, 6), 17>
- <4, (18, 15), 0>
- <4, (18, 6), 17>
- <6, (8, 13), 2>
- <6, (16, 3), 11>
- <6, (16, 3), 14>
- <7, (0, 15), 11>
- <8, (12, 14), 9>
- <10, (11, 15), 18>
- <13, (19, 11), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, therefore the final count is [20].
