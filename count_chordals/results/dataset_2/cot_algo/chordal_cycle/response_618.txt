Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:

<1, 6, 10, 5>
<1, 6, 14, 0>
<1, 6, 10, 8>
<1, 14, 11, 2>
<1, 14, 6, 9>
<1, 14, 11, 13>
<6, 10, 8, 4>
<6, 10, 1, 5>
<6, 10, 13, 7>
<6, 10, 4, 8>
<6, 14, 0, 8>
<6, 14, 11, 13>
<10, 8, 4, 10>
<10, 8, 4, 13>
<10, 8, 4, 10>
<10, 8, 4, 13>
<10, 1, 5, 7>
<10, 1, 5, 2>
<10, 13, 7, 11>
<10, 13, 7, 5>
<10, 13, 11, 14>
<10, 13, 11, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
<[1, 6, 10, 5]>
<[1, 14, 11, 2]>
<[10, 8, 4, 13]>
<[10, 1, 5, 7]>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the answer is [4].
