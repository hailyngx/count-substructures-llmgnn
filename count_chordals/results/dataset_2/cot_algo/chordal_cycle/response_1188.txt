- Cycle 17: (9, 0, 15, 5, 21)
- Cycle 18: (10, 2, 29, 7, 26)
- Cycle 19: (10, 26, 20, 11, 28)
- Cycle 20: (11, 3, 13, 15, 5)

- Cycle 23: (12, 1, 11, 28, 23)
- Cycle 24: (16, 6, 8, 0, 19)
- Cycle 25: (16, 25, 27, 14, 22)
- Cycle 26: (16, 23, 12, 4, 27)
- Cycle 27: (17, 27, 4, 15, 1)
- Cycle 28: (17, 16, 6, 8, 22)
- Cycle 29: (21, 5, 15, 1, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <2, (29, 3), 1>
- <2, (29, 8), 6>
- <2, (22, 8), 6>
- <2, (10, 7), 26>
- <3, (29, 7), 26>
- <3, (11, 1), 15>
- <3, (13, 15), 5>
- <4, (27, 14), 22>
- <4, (12, 1), 11>
- <4, (15, 1), 11>
- <7, (29, 3), 11>
- <7, (26, 20), 11>
- <7, (10, 24), 22>
- <8, (29, 3), 11>
- <8, (6, 16), 25>
- <9, (18, 27), 14>
- <9, (0, 15), 5>
- <10, (2, 29), 7>
- <10, (26, 20), 11>
- <11, (3, 13), 15>
- <11, (1, 15), 5>
- <12, (4, 15), 5>
- <12, (1, 11), 28>
- <16, (6, 8), 0>
- <16, (25, 27), 14>
- <16, (23, 12), 4>
- <17, (27, 4), 15>
- <17, (16, 6), 8>
- <21, (5, 15), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 28 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [28].
