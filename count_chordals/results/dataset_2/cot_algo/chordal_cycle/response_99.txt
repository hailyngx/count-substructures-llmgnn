Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 26) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 10) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 23) (27, 12) (27, 26) (4, 9) (4, 17) (28, 16) (28, 6) (28, 19) (29, 0) (0, 1) (0, 29) (0, 14) (0, 22) (0, 26) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 25) (6, 12) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 15) (6, 26) (5, 24) (19, 28) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 24) (17, 4) (17, 18) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 19) (24, 18) (24, 10) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 21) (22, 0) (7, 20) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 7) (21, 20) (21, 25) (21, 2) (21, 15) (26, 11) (26, 27) (26, 0) (26, 6) (2, 13) (2, 21) (23, 12) (23, 25) (10, 16) (10, 19) (10, 24) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 21) (15, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 24) (18, 15) (25, 14) (25, 21) (25, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- <11, 16, 28, 6, 11>
- <11, 16, 1, 0, 11>
- <16, 1, 0, 29, 16>
- <1, 0, 29, 14, 1>
- <0, 14, 13, 8, 0>
- <14, 13, 8, 1, 14>
- <13, 8, 1, 3, 13>
- <8, 13, 14, 25, 8>
- <13, 14, 0, 1, 13>
- <12, 27, 26, 0, 12>
- <27, 26, 0, 29, 27>
- <4, 9, 19, 28, 4>
- <16, 10, 19, 28, 16>
- <16, 10, 24, 6, 16>
- <16, 11, 18, 17, 16>
- <16, 11, 15, 6, 16>
- <1, 20, 7, 9, 1>
- <2, 21, 7, 9, 2>
- <12, 6, 24, 5, 12>
- <12, 6, 15, 21, 12>
- <12, 27, 26, 6, 12>
- <16, 11, 15, 21, 16>
- <16, 1, 20, 21, 16>
- <18, 17, 4, 9, 18>
- <18, 15, 21, 25, 18>
- <24, 6, 28, 16, 24>
- <24, 6, 15, 11, 24>
- <24, 19, 10, 16, 24>
- <24, 19, 9, 7, 24>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle:
- <16, 10, 24, 6, 16> (Chord: 10, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
