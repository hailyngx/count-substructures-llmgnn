Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle with nodes (6, 9, 2, 1) with edges ((6, 9), (9, 2), (2, 1), (1, 6))
- Cycle with nodes (6, 4, 0, 7) with edges ((6, 4), (4, 0), (0, 7), (7, 6))
- Cycle with nodes (6, 3, 5, 8) with edges ((6, 3), (3, 5), (5, 8), (8, 6))

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle (6, 9, 2, 1) has 1 chord: (9, 1)
- Cycle (6, 4, 0, 7) has 1 chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle (6, 3, 5, 8) has 1 chord: (3, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<6, 9, 2, 1> with chord (9, 1)
<6, 4, 0, 7> with chord (6, 7)
<6, 3, 5, 8> with chord (3, 8)
