Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 8, 6, 9)
- Cycle 4: (4, 3, 1, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 0, 8, 9, 7)
- Cycle 6: (3, 2, 1, 4, 3)
- Cycle 7: (6, 8, 9, 6)
- Cycle 8: (2, 0, 8, 9, 7, 3, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- The cycle <5, 4, 1, 2, 5> has no chord.
- The cycle <5, 7, 9, 6, 5> has no chord.
- The cycle <9, 8, 6, 9> has no chord.
- The cycle <4, 3, 1, 4> has no chord.
- The cycle <7, 0, 8, 9, 7> has no chord.
- The cycle <3, 2, 1, 4, 3> has no chord.
- The cycle <6, 8, 9, 6> has no chord.
- The cycle <2, 0, 8, 9, 7, 3, 2> has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 7 chordless cycles found.
The final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
