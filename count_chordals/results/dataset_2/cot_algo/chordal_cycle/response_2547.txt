Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 7-4-1-3-7
- Cycle 2: 7-4-1-9-7
- Cycle 3: 7-5-3-1-7
- Cycle 4: 7-5-3-9-7
- Cycle 5: 7-5-2-3-7
- Cycle 6: 7-5-2-9-7
- Cycle 7: 7-2-3-1-7
- Cycle 8: 7-2-3-5-7

Step 2: 
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- <7, (4, 1), 3>
- <7, (4, 9), 1>
- <7, (5, 3), 1>
- <7, (5, 9), 3>
- <7, (5, 2), 3>
- <7, (5, 9), 2>
- <7, (2, 3), 1>
- <7, (2, 5), 3>

Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].
