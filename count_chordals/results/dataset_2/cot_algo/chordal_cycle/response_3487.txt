Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 0) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle: (3, 1, 14, 9, 3)
2. Cycle: (8, 10, 7, 4, 3, 9, 8)
3. Cycle: (0, 14, 2, 13, 10, 8, 12, 6, 9, 3, 12)
4. Cycle: (9, 3, 4, 11, 6, 12, 8, 9)
5. Cycle: (7, 4, 11, 0, 14, 2, 13, 10, 7)
6. Cycle: (3, 12, 6, 11, 0, 8, 9, 14, 1, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the cycles listed above, only one of them has exactly one chord:
<8, 10, 7, (4, 3), 9, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
