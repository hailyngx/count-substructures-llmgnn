Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-9-3-4-1 (chords: 9-4)
- Cycle 2: 1-9-3-7-1 (chords: 9-7)
- Cycle 3: 1-9-3-5-1 (chords: 9-5)
- Cycle 4: 1-8-4-3-1 (chords: 8-3)
- Cycle 5: 1-8-4-2-1 (chords: 8-2)
- Cycle 6: 1-7-3-5-1 (chords: 7-5)
- Cycle 7: 1-7-3-9-1 (chords: 7-9)
- Cycle 8: 2-9-3-4-2 (chords: 9-4)
- Cycle 9: 2-9-3-7-2 (chords: 9-7)
- Cycle 10: 2-9-3-5-2 (chords: 9-5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 9, 3, 4, (9, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 8, 4, 3, (8, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 7, 3, 5, (7, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, 9, 3, 4, (9, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 9, 3, 7, (9, 7)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
- There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
