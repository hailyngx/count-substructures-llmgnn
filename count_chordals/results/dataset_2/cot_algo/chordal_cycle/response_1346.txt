Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle <0, 9, 2, 13>
- Cycle <0, 9, 2, 14>
- Cycle <0, 9, 11, 1>
- Cycle <0, 9, 11, 4>
- Cycle <0, 5, 13, 2>
- Cycle <0, 5, 13, 4>
- Cycle <0, 5, 13, 8>
- Cycle <0, 5, 3, 10>
- Cycle <1, 11, 9, 2>
- Cycle <1, 11, 9, 0>
- Cycle <1, 11, 4, 7>
- Cycle <1, 14, 2, 13>
- Cycle <1, 14, 2, 12>
- Cycle <2, 9, 11, 1>
- Cycle <3, 5, 13, 8>
- Cycle <3, 5, 13, 4>
- Cycle <3, 5, 13, 2>
- Cycle <3, 5, 0, 9>
- Cycle <3, 5, 0, 11>
- Cycle <3, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle <3, 10, 2, 9>
- Cycle <4, 11, 9, 0>
- Cycle <4, 11, 9, 2>
- Cycle <4, 11, 1, 14>
- Cycle <4, 7, 5, 6>
- Cycle <4, 7, 5, 8>
- Cycle <4, 13, 2, 9>
- Cycle <5, 6, 8, 13>
- Cycle <5, 7, 4, 11>
- Cycle <5, 7, 4, 13>
- Cycle <5, 8, 6, 12>
- Cycle <5, 8, 6, 10>
- Cycle <5, 8, 13, 2>
- Cycle <5, 8, 13, 4>
- Cycle <5, 13, 2, 9>
- Cycle <5, 13, 2, 14>
- Cycle <6, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle <6, 5, 7, 5>
- Cycle <6, 5, 3, 10>
- Cycle <6, 8, 4, 13>
- Cycle <7, 4, 11, 9>
- Cycle <7, 5, 8, 13>
- Cycle <8, 6, 5, 7>
- Cycle <8, 6, 5, 3>
- Cycle <8, 13, 5, 7>
- Cycle <9, 0, 5, 13>
- Cycle <9, 0, 5, 3>
- Cycle <9, 0, 11, 1>
- Cycle <10, 3, 5, 13>
- Cycle <10, 3, 5, 0>
- Cycle <10, 2, 9, 0>
- Cycle <11, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle <12, 6, 5, 7>
- Cycle <12, 6, 8, 13>
- Cycle <13, 4, 11, 9>
- Cycle <14, 1, 11, 4>
- Cycle <14, 1, 11, 0>
- Cycle <14, 2, 9, 11>
- Cycle <14, 2, 13, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 9, 11, 1> with chord (9, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 57 chordless 4-cycles.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
