Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 13) (8, 7) (8, 11) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 11 - 14 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 1 - 0 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 3: 9 - 11 - 10 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 4: 9 - 3 - 0 - 12 - 9
- Cycle 5: 4 - 7 - 10 - 11 - 4
- Cycle 6: 7 - 8 - 11 - 14 - 7
- Cycle 7: 7 - 6 - 2 - 10 - 7
- Cycle 8: 6 - 14 - 13 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 9: 10 - 2 - 6 - 7 - 10
- Cycle 10: 11 - 14 - 13 - 1 - 11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (0, 3), 5>
- <3, (0, 9), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
