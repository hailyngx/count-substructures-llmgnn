This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 22) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 6) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 22) (2, 1) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 0) (18, 20) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 8) (19, 13) (26, 5) (26, 6) (26, 12) (26, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 23) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 28) (3, 16) (3, 8) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 27) (4, 26) (4, 24) (4, 14) (22, 20) (22, 17) (22, 6) (5, 25) (5, 11) (5, 26) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 25) (6, 26) (6, 22) (6, 1) (6, 12) (29, 7) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 7) (8, 15) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 27) (24, 2) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 8) (24, 27) (9, 10) (9, 23) (9, 12) (27, 16) (27, 8) (27, 24) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 16) (13, 14) (12, 26) (12, 6) (12, 9) (23, 0) (23, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <20, 25, 5, 11, (20, 5)>    (chord: 20-5)
- <20, 25, 6, 26, (20, 26)>    (chord: 20-26)
- <20, 25, 6, 1, 2, (1, 25)>    (chord: 1-25)
- <20, 25, 6, 1, 2, 24, (2, 24)>    (chord: 2-24)
- <10, 15, 20, 25, (10, 20)>    (chord: 10-20)
- <10, 15, 20, 18, (15, 18)>    (chord: 15-18)
- <10, 15, 20, 22, (15, 22)>    (chord: 15-22)
- <10, 15, 8, 3, (8, 3)>    (chord: 8-3)

- <11, 5, 25, 6, (5, 6)>    (chord: 5-6)
- <11, 5, 26, 6, (5, 6)>    (chord: 5-6)
- <17, 10, 15, 20, (10, 15)>    (chord: 10-15)
- <17, 10, 15, 8, (10, 15)>    (chord: 10-15)
- <2, 1, 6, 25, (1, 6)>    (chord: 1-6)
- <2, 1, 6, 26, (1, 6)>    (chord: 1-6)
- <2 ,1, 6, 22, (1, 6)>    (chord: 1-6)
- <2, 24, 4, 26, (24, 26)>    (chord: 24-26)
- <2, 24, 4, 14, (24, 14)>    (chord: 24-14)
- <18, 20, 25, 5, (20, 25)>    (chord: 20 - 25)
- <15, 20, 25, 5, (20, 25)>    (chord: 20 - 25)
- <15, 20, 25, 11, (15, 25)>    (chord: 15-25)
- <15, 20, 22, 17, (15, 22)>    (chord: 15-22)
- <15, 20, 18, 20, (15, 18)>    (chord: 15-18)
- <15, 10, 17, 22, (10, 17)>    (chord: 10-17)
- <19, 13, 14, 4, (13, 14)>    (chord: 13-14)
- <26, 5, 25, 20, (5, 25)>    (chord: 5-25)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Since all cycles we found have a single chord, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [27].
