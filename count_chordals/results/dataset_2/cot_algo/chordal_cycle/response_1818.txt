Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-5-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-8-9-1

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (4, 2)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (4, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 4, 2, 5> with chord (4, 2)
- <1, 4, 8, 9> with chord (4, 8)
