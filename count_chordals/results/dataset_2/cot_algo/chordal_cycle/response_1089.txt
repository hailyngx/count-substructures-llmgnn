Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 16) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 2) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 15) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 15) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (15, 11) (15, 0) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 3) (12, 1) (16, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (5, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 3 - 7 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 10 - 17 - 11 - 1
- Cycle 3: 2 - 9 - 14 - 13 - 2
- Cycle 4: 3 - 8 - 13 - 12 - 3
- Cycle 5: 4 - 6 - 14 - 13 - 4
- Cycle 6: 1 - 12 - 18 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 12 - 13 - 14 - 1
- Cycle 8: 11 - 17 - 10 - 1 - 11

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
<1, 3, 7, 9>, chords: (9, 0)
<1, 10, 17, 11>, chords: (11, 1)
<2, 9, 14, 13>, chords: (9, 14)
<3, 8, 13, 12>, chords: (13, 3)
<4, 6, 14, 13>, chords: (14, 4)
<1, 12, 18, 2>, chords: (2, 12)
<1, 12, 13, 14>, chords: (13, 12)
<11, 17, 10, 1>, chords: (10, 17)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
In this case, all the cycles listed have exactly one chord, so the number of chordless cycles is 0.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
