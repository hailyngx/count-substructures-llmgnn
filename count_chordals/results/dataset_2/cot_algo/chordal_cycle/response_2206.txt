Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 29) (22, 15) (22, 11) (1, 21) (1, 28) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 23) (21, 2) (21, 15) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 20) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 12) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 18) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 28) (20, 11) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 16) (29, 13) (29, 10) (29, 19) (29, 24) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (26, 24) (24, 29) (24, 26) (24, 4) (24, 18) (5, 8) (5, 27) (19, 29) (19, 25) (15, 22) (15, 21) (15, 10) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 2) (16, 28) (16, 6) (4, 2) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 23) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 4) (25, 0) (25, 19) (25, 27) (27, 5) (27, 25) (27, 14) (7, 10) (7, 6) (11, 22) (11, 20) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 23) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 23) (14, 20) (14, 27) (18, 0) (18, 24) (23, 21) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 21, 15, 22, 1)
- (2, 21, 15, 10, 2)
- (2, 21, 15, 10, 17, 12, 13, 29, 24, 4, 2)
- (4, 2, 21, 15, 10, 17, 12, 4)
- (8, 9, 21, 15, 10, 17, 12, 4, 23, 6, 7, 10, 2, 9, 8)
- (21, 15, 10, 17, 12, 4, 23, 6, 7, 10, 2, 21)
- (21, 15, 22, 11, 20, 28, 1, 21)
- (24, 29, 13, 12, 4, 24)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (21, 15), 22, (1, 21)>
- <2, (21, 15), 10, (2, 21)>
- <2, (21, 15), 10, 17, 12, 4, (2, 21)>
- <4, (2, 21), 15, 10, (17, 12), 4>
- <8, (9, 21), 15, 10, 17, 12, 4, 23, 6, 7, 10, 2, (9, 8)>
- <21, (15, 22), 11, 20, 28, 1, 21>
- <24, 29, 13, 12, (4, 24)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
