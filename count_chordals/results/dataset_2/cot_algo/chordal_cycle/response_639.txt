Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 5) (27, 0) (27, 28) (27, 1) (27, 16) (1, 27) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 17) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 15) (7, 15) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 21) (29, 11) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 4) (26, 25) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 11) (20, 21) (20, 10) (2, 17) (2, 16) (22, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 5) (16, 27) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 14) (23, 26) (23, 10) (23, 9) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 8) (28, 4) (28, 5) (6, 17) (6, 4) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 26) (15, 11) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 10) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 28) (4, 6) (9, 23) (9, 24) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 20) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 28) (5, 24) (24, 9) (24, 5) (10, 25) (10, 20) (10, 23) (10, 14) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 27, 1, 8) with edges (0, 27), (27, 1), (1, 8), (8, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 27, 16, 2) with edges (0, 27), (27, 16), (16, 2), (2, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 15, 13, 1) with edges (0, 15), (15, 13), (13, 1), (1, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 5, 18, 8) with edges (0, 5), (5, 18), (18, 8), (8, 0)
- Cycle 5: (27, 16, 2, 17) with edges (27, 16), (16, 2), (2, 17), (17, 27)
- Cycle 6: (1, 8, 13, 15) with edges (1, 8), (8, 13), (13, 15), (15, 1)
- Cycle 7: (8, 18, 19, 4) with edges (8, 18), (18, 19), (19, 4), (4, 8)
- Cycle 8: (13, 15, 11, 26) with edges (13, 15), (15, 11), (11, 26), (26, 13)
- Cycle 9: (15, 26, 25, 21) with edges (15, 26), (26, 25), (25, 21), (21, 15)
- Cycle 10: (4, 19, 26, 23) with edges (4, 19), (19, 26), (26, 23), (23, 4)
- Cycle 11: (9, 23, 26, 11) with edges (9, 23), (23, 26), (26, 11), (11, 9)
- Cycle 12: (21, 25, 26, 19) with edges (21, 25), (25, 26), (26, 19), (19, 21)
- Cycle 13: (10, 20, 21, 25) with edges (10, 20), (20, 21), (21, 25), (25, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (27, 8), 0>
- Cycle 2: <2, (27, 16), 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, (15, 13), 0>
- Cycle 4: <8, (5, 18), 0>
- Cycle 5: <17, (16, 2), 27>
- Cycle 6: <1, (13, 8), 15>
- Cycle 7: <18, (19, 4), 8>
- Cycle 8: <26, (11, 15), 13>
- Cycle 9: <15, (25, 26), 21>
- Cycle 10: <26, (19, 23), 4>
- Cycle 11: <26, (11, 23), 9>
- Cycle 12: <26, (19, 25), 21>
- Cycle 13: <25, (20, 21), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
