Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) 

Response:
There are multiple chordal 4-cycles in this graph. Let's identify and count them step by step:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 12, 10, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 11, 3, 4, 9)
- Cycle 3: (10, 2, 7, 4, 10)
- Cycle 4: (11, 1, 6, 13, 11)
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 2, 5, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 10)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (11, 3)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (2, 7)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (7, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles in total.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, (9, 10)>
<9, (11, 3)>
<10, (2, 7)>
<11, (1, 6)>
<4, (7, 2)>
