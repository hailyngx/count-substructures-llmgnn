Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (9, 10) (9, 16) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 16) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 11) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 12) (19, 18) (19, 12) (12, 16) (12, 19) (0, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 14) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <1, 6, 5, 8, 7, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 0, 3, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 13, 14, 10, 15, 11, 5, 6, 1>
- Cycle 4: <3, 1, 2, 18, 16, 7, 13, 3>
- Cycle 5: <10, 9, 16, 7, 1, 6, 5, 11, 15, 18, 16, 10>
- Cycle 6: <16, 9, 10, 17, 4, 11, 15, 18, 2, 1, 13, 14, 10>
- Cycle 7: <16, 9, 10, 14, 13, 2, 18, 15, 11, 4, 17, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, 6, 5, 8, 7, 1> - Chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 0, 3, 1> - No chord
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 13, 14, 10, 15, 11, 5, 6, 1> - Chord: (3, 5)
- Cycle 4: <3, 1, 2, 18, 16, 7, 13, 3> - Chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 5: <10, 9, 16, 7, 1, 6, 5, 11, 15, 18, 16, 10> - Chord: (9, 15)
- Cycle 6: <16, 9, 10, 17, 4, 11, 15, 18, 2, 1, 13, 14, 10> - Chord: (9, 18)
- Cycle 7: <16, 9, 10, 14, 13, 2, 18, 15, 11, 4, 17, 10> - Chord: (9, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
