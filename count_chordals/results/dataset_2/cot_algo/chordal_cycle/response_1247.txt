Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- 0-3-7-5-0
- 0-4-1-8-5-0
- 0-4-6-1-8-7-3-0
- 0-4-6-9-8-7-3-0
- 0-2-7-3-0
- 0-2-7-5-0
- 1-4-6-9-1
- 1-4-8-6-9-1
- 2-6-4-1-2
- 2-6-8-1-2
- 2-6-9-1-2
- 2-7-3-5-2
- 2-7-5-3-2
- 3-7-5-0-3
- 4-6-1-8-4
- 5-7-3-0-5
- 5-7-8-1-5

Step 2:
Following cycles have exactly one chord:
- <0, (8, 5), 2>
- <0, (1, 8), 4>
- <0, (3, 7), 5>
- <1, (6, 9), 4>
- <3, (5, 7), 0>
- <6, (2, 9), 4>
- <8, (1, 4), 5>

Step 3:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [7].
