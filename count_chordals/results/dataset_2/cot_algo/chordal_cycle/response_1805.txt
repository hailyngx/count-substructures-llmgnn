Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 17) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 15) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 1) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 18) (3, 5) (14, 6) (14, 16) (14, 5) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 19) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) (16, 10) (16, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 6) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 1) (15, 4) (15, 12)

- Cycle 30: 18-2-4-15-18
- Cycle 31: 18-9-10-16-18
- Cycle 32: 0-8-9-10-0

- Cycle 46: 19-2-18-10-19
- Cycle 47: 19-6-14-5-19
- Cycle 48: 12-13-17-7-12
- Cycle 49: 12-0-8-9-12
- Cycles with length 5 or more do not exist in this graph.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <8, (0, 1), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <8, 4, (2, 6), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, (10, 11), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (4, 2), 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <11, (10, 17), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <13, (12, 15), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <17, (7, 1), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <19, (4, 15), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [8].
