Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 8, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (9, 6, 0, 2, 9)
        - Cycle 3: (9, 6, 0, 1, 9)
        - Cycle 4: (6, 0, 2, 7, 6)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 8, 7, 2, 4)
        - Cycle 6: (8, 7, 2, 3, 8)
        - Cycle 7: (2, 3, 7, 0, 2)
        - Cycle 8: (0, 7, 8, 4, 0)
        - Cycle 9: (7, 3, 2, 0, 7)
        - Cycle 10: (3, 4, 8, 1, 3)
        - Cycle 11: (1, 0, 6, 9, 1)
        - Cycle 12: (2, 7, 0, 1, 2)
        - Cycle 13: (7, 1, 9, 5, 7)
        - Cycle 14: (4, 9, 1, 0, 4)
        - Cycle 15: (8, 5, 3, 2, 8)
        - Cycle 16: (3, 5, 8, 7, 3)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 1: <5, (9, 4), 8, 5>
        - Cycle 2: <9, (6, 0), 2, 9>
        - Cycle 3: <9, (6, 0), 1, 9>
        - Cycle 4: <6, (0, 2), 7, 6>
        - Cycle 5: <4, (8, 7), 2, 4>
        - Cycle 6: <8, (7, 2), 3, 8>
        - Cycle 7: <2, (3, 7), 0, 2>
        - Cycle 8: <0, (7, 8), 4, 0>
        - Cycle 9: <7, (3, 2), 0, 7>
        - Cycle 10: <3, (4, 8), 1, 3>
        - Cycle 11: <1, (0, 6), 9, 1>
        - Cycle 12: <2, (1, 0), 7, 2>
        - Cycle 13: <7, (1, 9), 5, 7>
        - Cycle 14: <4, (9, 1), 0, 4>
        - Cycle 15: <8, (5, 3), 2, 8>
        - Cycle 16: <3, (5, 8), 7, 3>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [16].
