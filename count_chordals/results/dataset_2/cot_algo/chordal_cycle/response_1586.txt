Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:  
- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 6 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 6 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 6 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 3 - 2 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 3 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 7: 2 - 3 - 9 - 2
- Cycle 8: 4 - 5 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 9: 4 - 6 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 10: 4 - 6 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 11: 4 - 6 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 12: 4 - 7 - 2 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 13: 4 - 8 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 14: 6 - 8 - 4 - 6
- Cycle 15: 6 - 9 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 16: 7 - 8 - 0 - 7

Step 2: 
Checking cycles for exactly one chord: 
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (6, 4), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (6, 8), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (6, 9), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (3, 2), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (3, 6), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, (5, 0), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, (6, 1), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, (6, 9), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (7, 2), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <4, (8, 0), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <6, (8, 4), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <6, (9, 3), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <7, (8, 0), 4>

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [13].
