Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 6) (14, 3) (14, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 3-4-7-1-3
- Cycle 2: 4-6-2-9-4
- Cycle 3: 5-13-8-10-5
- Cycle 4: 6-14-3-12-6
- Cycle 5: 7-0-1-6-7
- Cycle 6: 7-0-12-3-7
- Cycle 7: 8-13-2-9-8
- Cycle 8: 9-12-7-4-9
- Cycle 9: 10-13-8-11-10
- Cycle 10: 11-0-7-1-11
- Cycle 11: 12-0-7-4-12
- Cycle 12: 12-2-6-14-12
- Cycle 13: 13-8-10-5-13
- Cycle 14: 14-6-4-3-14

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2: 4-6-2-9-4 has one chord (6, 9) 
- Cycle 7: 8-13-2-9-8 has one chord (2, 13)

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
