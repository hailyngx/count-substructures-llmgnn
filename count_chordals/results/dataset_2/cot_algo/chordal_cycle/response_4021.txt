- Cycle 24: (8, 3, 1, 5) 
- Cycle 25: (8, 4, 9, 7) 
- Cycle 26: (9, 4, 1, 5) 
  
Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle: 
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (3, 8).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (4, 8).
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has a chord (5, 2).
- Cycle 6 has a chord (0, 8).
- Cycle 7 has a chord (0, 5).
- Cycle 8 has no chord.
- Cycle 9 has no chord.
- Cycle 10 has no chord.
- Cycle 11 has a chord (1, 6).
- Cycle 12 has a chord (2, 8).
- Cycle 13 has a chord (4, 8).
- Cycle 14 has no chord.
- Cycle 15 has no chord.
- Cycle 16 has a chord (4, 6).
- Cycle 17 has no chord.
- Cycle 18 has no chord.
- Cycle 19 has a chord (2, 8).
- Cycle 20 has a chord (8, 9).
- Cycle 21 has a chord (3, 5).
- Cycle 22 has a chord (5, 9).
- Cycle 23 has a chord (0, 6).
- Cycle 24 has a chord (3, 5).
- Cycle 25 has a chord (4, 7).
- Cycle 26 has no chord.
  
Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 13 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count is [13].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (3, 8), 4>
- <1, (4, 8), 9>
- <1, (5, 2), 6>
- <1, (0, 8), 6>
- <1, (0, 5), 2>
- <2, (1, 6), 3>
- <2, (2, 8), 4>
- <4, (4, 6), 8>
- <5, (2, 8), 6>
- <8, (8, 9), 7>
- <9, (4, 7), 5>
- <3, (3, 5), 7>
- <7, (0, 6), 1>
