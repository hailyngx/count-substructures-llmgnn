Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 15) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 13) (1, 3) (1, 24) (21, 7) (21, 11) (21, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 17) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 26) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 28) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 19) (25, 27) (25, 3) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 23) (11, 21) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 29) (14, 21) (14, 8) (14, 16) (17, 27) (17, 6) (17, 5) (22, 4) (22, 15) (24, 1) (24, 6) (24, 29) (24, 20) (20, 24) (20, 29) (20, 2) (29, 11) (29, 24) (29, 20) (6, 17) (6, 24) (4, 0) (4, 22) (28, 0) (28, 8) (28, 7) (28, 2) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 16) (18, 27) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 15) (23, 9) (23, 10) (15, 9) (15, 22) (15, 18) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 19) (5, 17) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (7, 21, 14, 16)
- (25, 27, 12, 19)
- (10, 11, 8, 13)
- (11, 21, 7, 28)
- (24, 1, 3, 25)
- (2, 20, 29, 24)
- (16, 14, 21, 7)
- (16, 14, 8, 11)
- (27, 12, 13, 10)
- (27, 12, 19, 9)
- (18, 15, 22, 4)
- (18, 15, 9, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <7, 21, 14, 16>
- <25, 27, 12, 19>
- <10, 11, 8, 13>
- <11, 21, 7, 28>
- <24, 1, 3, 25>
- <2, 20, 29, 24>
- <16, 14, 8, 11>
- <27, 12, 13, 10>
- <18, 15, 22, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles = [9].
