Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 7 - 2 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 4 - 0 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 4 - 3 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 2 - 7 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 6: 2 - 6 - 0 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 7: 2 - 6 - 5 - 0 - 2
- Cycle 8: 3 - 4 - 5 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 9: 6 - 5 - 4 - 0 - 6
- Cycle 10: 7 - 0 - 3 - 4 - 7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 7, 2, 6, 0> has a chord: (0, 2)
- The cycle <1, 4, 5, 6, 1> has a chord: (4, 6)
- The cycle <1, 4, 0, 7, 1> has a chord: (1, 7)
- The cycle <1, 4, 3, 7, 1> has a chord: (3, 7)
- The cycle <1, 2, 7, 3, 1> has a chord: (2, 3)
- The cycle <2, 6, 0, 4, 2> has a chord: (0, 4)
- The cycle <2, 6, 5, 0, 2> has a chord: (5, 6)
- The cycle <3, 4, 5, 0, 3> has a chord: (4, 5)
- The cycle <6, 5, 4, 0, 6> has a chord: (5, 4)
- The cycle <7, 0, 3, 4, 7> has a chord: (3, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
In this case, all cycles have chords, so the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
