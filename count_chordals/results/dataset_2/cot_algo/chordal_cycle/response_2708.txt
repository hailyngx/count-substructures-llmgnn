Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 8) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 13) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 16) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 8) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 10) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (15, 12) (15, 10) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 15) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (18, 9) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 2) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 11) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
Let's find the chordal 4-cycle in this graph step-by-step:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- The possible 4-cycles in the graph are: 
1. (0, 3, 16, 9)
2. (0, 3, 16, 14)
3. (0, 13, 7, 12)
4. (0, 13, 7, 19)
5. (0, 13, 5, 8)
6. (2, 3, 16, 9)
7. (2, 3, 16, 14)
8. (2, 7, 12, 15)
9. (2, 7, 12, 8)
10. (2, 7, 13, 5)
11. (2, 0, 3, 16)
12. (2, 0, 13, 7)
13. (2, 0, 13, 5)
14. (2, 11, 4, 6)
15. (2, 11, 4, 19)
16. (2, 11, 0, 3)
17. (2, 11, 0, 13)
18. (5, 13, 7, 12)
19. (5, 13, 7, 19)
20. (5, 13, 0, 3)
21. (5, 13, 0, 11)
22. (5, 8, 14, 16)
23. (5, 8, 14, 10)
24. (5, 8, 12, 7)
25. (5, 8, 12, 15)
26. (8, 14, 16, 3)
27. (8, 14, 10, 5)
28. (8, 14, 10, 15)
29. (8, 6, 9, 16)
30. (8, 6, 9, 18)
31. (8, 6, 4, 11)
32. (8, 6, 4, 19)
33. (9, 6, 4, 11)
34. (9, 6, 4, 19)
35. (9, 6, 8, 12)
36. (9, 16, 14, 10)
37. (13, 17, 7, 12)
38. (13, 17, 7, 19)
39. (13, 17, 0, 3)
40. (13, 7, 12, 15)
41. (15, 12, 7, 19)
42. (15, 12, 8, 5)
43. (15, 10, 14, 8)
44. (15, 10, 14, 16)
45. (16, 14, 10, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
1. <2, (0, 13), 7, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- So, the number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1].
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <2, (0, 13), 7, 12>.
