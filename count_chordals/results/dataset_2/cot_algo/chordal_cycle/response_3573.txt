Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 19) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 18) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 7) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 17) (4, 10) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 6) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 17) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 2) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 17) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 7) (13, 18) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 1, 3, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 14, 1, 19, 18, 13, 7>
- Cycle 3: <2, 17, 0, 14, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 17, 9, 15, 6, 19>
- Cycle 5: <2, 17, 16, 12, 4, 10>
- Cycle 6: <4, 12, 16, 19, 6, 15>
- Cycle 7: <5, 3, 1, 19, 18, 11, 8>
- Cycle 8: <5, 14, 1, 19, 18, 13, 7>
- Cycle 9: <7, 5, 3, 1, 14, 0>
- Cycle 10: <7, 6, 15, 9, 17, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for one chord:

- Cycle 1 has chords: (1, 14)
- Cycle 2 has chords: (19, 18)
- Cycle 3 has chords: (14, 1)
- Cycle 4 has chords: (17, 15)
- Cycle 5 has chords: (12, 10)
- Cycle 6 has chords: (19, 12)
- Cycle 7 has chords: (18, 1)
- Cycle 8 has chords: (19, 18)
- Cycle 9 has chords: (5, 3)
- Cycle 10 has chords: (9, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the provided graph is [0].
