Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 14) (6, 7) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 11) (17, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (0, 15) (0, 7) (14, 15) (14, 1) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 18) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (19, 4) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 19) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 8) (16, 3) (18, 10) (18, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-15-0-7-3
- Cycle 2: 3-8-17-13-3
- Cycle 3: 3-16-7-0-3
- Cycle 4: 3-5-12-9-3
- Cycle 5: 15-9-4-17-15
- Cycle 6: 15-0-7-1-15
- Cycle 7: 7-6-15-0-7
- Cycle 8: 7-1-2-5-7
- Cycle 9: 13-17-4-10-13
- Cycle 10: 4-17-8-12-4

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (0, 7), 3> has exactly one chord 7 connecting non-adjacent vertices 0 and 3.
- <2, (8, 17), 13> has exactly one chord 8 connecting non-adjacent vertices 17 and 13.
- <3, (7, 16), 3> has exactly one chord 16 connecting non-adjacent vertices 7 and 3.
- <4, (5, 9), 3> has exactly one chord 9 connecting non-adjacent vertices 5 and 3.
- <5, (4, 17), 15> has exactly one chord 17 connecting non-adjacent vertices 4 and 15.
- <6, (1, 0), 15> has exactly one chord 0 connecting non-adjacent vertices 1 and 15.
- <7, (0, 7), 15> has exactly one chord 7 connecting non-adjacent vertices 0 and 15.
- <8, (1, 5), 7> has exactly one chord 5 connecting non-adjacent vertices 1 and 7.
- <9, (10, 13), 4> has exactly one chord 13 connecting non-adjacent vertices 10 and 4.
- <10, (8, 12), 17> has exactly one chord 12 connecting non-adjacent vertices 8 and 17.

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [0]
