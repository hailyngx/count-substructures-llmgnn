Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
 - There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.
  
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
