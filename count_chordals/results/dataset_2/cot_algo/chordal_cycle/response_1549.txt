Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 11) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (12, 13) (12, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
      - <5, 6, 1, 5>
      - <5, 9, 7, 4>
      - <5, 14, 8, 4>
      - <5, 9, 11, 4>
      - <9, 11, 6, 7>
      - <9, 7, 4, 8>
      - <9, 14, 8, 4>
      - <4, 8, 14, 5>
      - <4, 14, 9, 11>
      - <4, 11, 6, 7>
      - <4, 3, 10, 0>
      - <7, 6, 5, 9>
      - <7, 9, 14, 8>

Step 2:
      - <5, 6, 1, 5> has one chord: (6, 1)
      - <5, 14, 8, 4> has one chord: (14, 8)
      - <9, 14, 8, 4> has one chord: (14, 8)
      - <4, 8, 14, 5> has one chord: (14, 5)
      - <4, 3, 10, 0> has one chord: (3, 10)

Step 3:
      - Count of chordal 4-cycles: [5]
