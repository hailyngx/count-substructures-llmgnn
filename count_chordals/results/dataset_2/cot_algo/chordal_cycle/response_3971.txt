The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 12) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 3) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 21) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 10) (19, 12) (26, 19) (26, 7) (2, 18) (2, 27) (2, 24) (2, 7) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 22) (6, 20) (3, 4) (3, 29) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 21) (24, 8) (24, 2) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 17) (15, 21) (20, 6) (20, 7) (20, 23) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 27) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 10) (17, 15) (17, 27) (17, 7) (25, 0) (14, 6) (7, 26) (7, 2) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 13) (5, 28) (5, 12) (5, 22) (5, 27) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 5) (23, 4) (23, 20) (23, 13) (0, 1) (0, 25) (0, 22) (22, 6) (22, 5) (22, 0) (27, 2) (27, 9) (27, 17) (27, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 23) (10, 19) (10, 9) (10, 16) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

        <4, 8, 9, 3>
        <4, 8, 12, 19>
        <4, 23, 20, 6>
        <8, 12, 19, 28>
        <8, 24, 2, 7>
        <8, 9, 3, 29>
        <28, 19, 12, 5>
        <29, 3, 9, 27>
        <18, 2, 24, 8>
        <18, 21, 15, 17>
        <19, 12, 5, 22>
        <19, 26, 7, 17>
        <2, 18, 21, 15>
        <2, 7, 17, 27>
        <6, 1, 16, 10>
        <3, 29, 3, 9>
        <8, 8, 24, 2>
        <1, 6, 20, 7>
        <26, 19, 12, 5>
        <6, 14, 6, 22>
        <7, 7, 26, 19>
        <29, 28, 19, 12>
        <7, 7, 17, 27>
        <5, 5, 12, 19>
        <2, 24, 8, 9>
        <7, 17, 27, 5>
        <7, 20, 23, 13>
        <20, 6, 1, 16>
        <12, 19, 26, 7>
        <23, 4, 8, 24>
        <0, 1, 6, 20>
        <22, 6, 1, 16>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

        Chordal 4-cycles:
        <4, 8, 9, 3> (4, 9)
        <4, 8, 12, 19> (8, 19)
        <4, 23, 20, 6> (23, 20)
        <8, 12, 19, 28> (12, 28)
        <8, 24, 2, 7> (2, 7)
        <8, 9, 3, 29> (9, 29)
        <28, 19, 12, 5> (19, 5)
        <29, 3, 9, 27> (3, 27)
        <18, 2, 24, 8> (2, 8)
        <18, 21, 15, 17> (21, 15)
        <19, 12, 5, 22> (12, 22)
        <19, 26, 7, 17> (26, 17)

        <2, 7, 17, 27> (7, 27)
        <6, 1, 16, 10> (1, 16)
        <3, 29, 3, 9> (3, 9)
        <8, 8, 24, 2> (8, 24)
        <1, 6, 20, 7> (6, 20)
        <26, 19, 12, 5> (19, 12)
        <6, 14, 6, 22> (6, 22)
        <7, 7, 26, 19> (7, 19)
        <29, 28, 19, 12> (28, 12)
        <7, 7, 17, 27> (7, 27)
        <5, 5, 12, 19> (5, 19)

        <7, 20, 23, 13> (20, 13)
        <20, 6, 1, 16> (6, 1)
        <12, 19, 26, 7> (19, 7)
        <23, 4, 8, 24> (4, 24)
        <0, 1, 6, 20> (1, 20)
        <22, 6, 1, 16> (6, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [31]
