Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 1 - 6 - 0 
- Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 3 - 7 - 0 
- Cycle 3: 0 - 4 - 8 - 7 - 0 
- Cycle 4: 0 - 6 - 1 - 5 - 0 
- Cycle 5: 0 - 6 - 2 - 7 - 0 
- Cycle 6: 0 - 7 - 2 - 6 - 0 
- Cycle 7: 1 - 4 - 3 - 7 - 1 
- Cycle 8: 1 - 4 - 8 - 7 - 1 
- Cycle 9: 1 - 5 - 2 - 6 - 1 
- Cycle 10: 2 - 3 - 4 - 8 - 2 
- Cycle 11: 2 - 5 - 6 - 1 - 2 
- Cycle 12: 2 - 5 - 7 - 0 - 2 
- Cycle 13: 3 - 4 - 8 - 7 - 3 
- Cycle 14: 3 - 7 - 0 - 6 - 3 

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle: 
<0, (3, 7), 1> 
<0, (4, 8), 2> 
<0, (1, 5), 3> 
<0, (2, 6), 4> 
<1, (4, 8), 2> 
<1, (5, 6), 3> 
<2, (3, 7), 1> 
<2, (5, 7), 4> 
<3, (4, 8), 2> 
<3, (7, 6), 9> 

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
[2]

Therefore, the graph has 2 chordal 4-cycles, which are:
<0, (3, 7), 1>
<1, (5, 6), 3>
