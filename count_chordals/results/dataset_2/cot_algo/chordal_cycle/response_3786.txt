Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 4) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 6) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <5, 9, 13, 7>
2. <5, 9, 13, 3>
3. <5, 7, 12, 9>
4. <5, 7, 11, 12>
5. <5, 7, 11, 3>
6. <9, 13, 3, 11>
7. <9, 13, 7, 12>
8. <7, 12, 11, 3>
9. <12, 11, 3, 0>
10. <2, 11, 7, 12>
11. <2, 11, 3, 0>
12. <2, 11, 7, 14>
13. <0, 12, 7, 11>
14. <0, 12, 11, 3>
15. <14, 7, 11, 2>
16. <3, 11, 7, 5>
17. <11, 7, 5, 14>
18. <11, 7, 14, 5>
19. <11, 2, 4, 6>
20. <4, 6, 10, 1>
21. <1, 10, 13, 9>

Step 2: 
Among the cycles listed above, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 13, 7> with chord (9, 13)

Step 3: 
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <5, 9, 13, 7> with chord (9, 13).
