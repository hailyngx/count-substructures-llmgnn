Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 7, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 11, 10, 6, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 7, 12, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 10, 11, 9, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 6, 10, 2, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 6, 10, 2, 13, 3, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 6, 10, 11, 3, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 7, 4, 1) <7, (4, 7)> - Chord found
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 11, 10, 6, 1) - No chord
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 7, 12, 1) - No chord
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 10, 11, 9, 1) - No chord
- Cycle 5: (1, 6, 10, 2, 8, 5, 1) - No chord
- Cycle 6: (1, 6, 10, 2, 13, 3, 1) <13, (2, 13)> - Chord found
- Cycle 7: (1, 6, 10, 11, 3, 1) - No chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles = [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (4, 7), 3>
- <1, (2, 13), 6>
