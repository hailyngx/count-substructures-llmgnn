Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 14) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (4, 9, 14, 6)
- Cycle 2: (4, 2, 8, 11)
- Cycle 3: (7, 1, 5, 10)
- Cycle 4: (7, 8, 13, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 14, 13, 7)
- Cycle 6: (6, 13, 10, 1)
- Cycle 7: (9, 14, 13, 6)
- Cycle 8: (8, 13, 10, 7)
- Cycle 9: (8, 2, 5, 1)
- Cycle 10: (13, 7, 10, 1)
- Cycle 11: (13, 14, 9, 4)
- Cycle 12: (1, 7, 10, 5)
- Cycle 13: (1, 12, 3, 11)
- Cycle 14: (3, 11, 8, 2)
- Cycle 15: (5, 2, 8, 11)
- Cycle 16: (5, 1, 7, 10)
- Cycle 17: (2, 8, 13, 6)
- Cycle 18: (11, 8, 13, 10)
- Cycle 19: (14, 13, 6, 12)
- Cycle 20: (12, 6, 0, 1)
- Cycle 21: (10, 13, 7, 1)
- Cycle 22: (0, 6, 14, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <4, (9, 14), 6>
- <4, (2, 8), 11>
- <7, (1, 5), 10>
- <7, (8, 13), 6>
- <6, (14, 13), 7>
- <6, (13, 10), 1>
- <9, (14, 13), 6>
- <8, (13, 10), 7>
- <8, (2, 5), 1>
- <13, (7, 10), 1>
- <13, (14, 9), 4>
- <1, (7, 10), 5>
- <1, (12, 3), 11>
- <3, (11, 8), 2>
- <5, (2, 8), 11>
- <5, (1, 7), 10>
- <2, (8, 13), 6>
- <11, (8, 13), 10>
- <14, (13, 6), 12>
- <12, (6, 0), 1>
- <10, (13, 7), 1>
- <0, (6, 14), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 22 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, so the final count is [22].
