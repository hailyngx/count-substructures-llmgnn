Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 9) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 7) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (4, 15) (4, 3) (18, 9) (18, 1) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 6) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 10) (10, 13) (10, 6) (1, 12) (1, 18) (1, 8) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Some of the cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 9, 13, 17, 7, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 15, 4, 3, 16, 11)
- Cycle 3: (11, 7, 17, 13, 15, 11)
- Cycle 4: (11, 6, 7, 12, 0, 2, 5, 8, 1, 12, 6, 11)
- Cycle 5: (16, 3, 4, 15, 11, 6, 7, 3, 19, 6, 10, 13, 15, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the listed cycles above, we can find one unique chordal 4-cycle:
<2, 4, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As we found one unique chordal 4-cycle, the final count is [1].
