Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 11) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 24) (22, 25) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 24) (7, 21) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 20) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 9) (27, 25) (27, 1) (28, 21) (28, 10) (28, 25) (26, 13) (26, 5) (26, 17) (9, 12) (9, 24) (4, 25) (11, 13) (11, 6) (20, 21) (20, 8) (20, 2) (20, 5) (29, 23) (29, 14) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 0) (25, 22) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 4) (25, 2) (5, 26) (5, 20) (5, 8) (5, 18) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 16) (0, 17) (16, 0) (1, 27) (1, 14) (1, 18) (6, 11) (6, 8) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 14) (18, 13) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 10) (14, 29) (14, 1) (14, 2) (24, 22) (24, 15) (24, 9) (10, 28) (10, 18) (10, 23) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 0) (23, 29) (23, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. <3, 15, 24, 22>
2. <9, 12, 3, 15>
3. <25, 22, 24, 15>
4. <5, 26, 13, 21>
5. <21, 13, 22, 24>
6. <6, 11, 13, 21>
7. <20, 21, 13, 22>
8. <8, 20, 21, 13>
9. <0, 19, 15, 3>
10. <18, 13, 21, 7>
11. <1, 27, 25, 22>
12. <14, 1, 27, 25>
13. <17, 26, 5, 20>
14. <29, 23, 10, 28>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

1. <3, 15, 24, 22> - Chord: (15, 22)
2. <9, 12, 3, 15> - Chord: (9, 15)
3. <25, 22, 24, 15> - Chord: (22, 15)
4. <5, 26, 13, 21> - Chord: (26, 21)
5. <21, 13, 22, 24> - Chord: (13, 24)
6. <6, 11, 13, 21> - Chord: (11, 21)
7. <20, 21, 13, 22> - Chord: (21, 22)
8. <8, 20, 21, 13> - Chord: (20, 13)
9. <0, 19, 15, 3> - Chord: (19, 15)
10. <18, 13, 21, 7> - Chord: (13, 21)
11. <1, 27, 25, 22> - Chord: (27, 25)
12. <14, 1, 27, 25> - Chord: (1, 25)
13. <17, 26, 5, 20> - Chord: (26, 5)
14. <29, 23, 10, 28> - Chord: (23, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless cycles found. Thus, the final count is [0].
