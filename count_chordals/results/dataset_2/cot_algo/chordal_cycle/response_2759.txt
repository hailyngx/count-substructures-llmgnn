Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 10) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 14) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 13) (17, 2) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (10, 16) (10, 8) (12, 5) (12, 13) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 18) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (19, 15) (19, 7) (18, 16) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 9, 13, 12, 5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 11)
- Cycle 2: (16, 10, 8, 7, 19, 15, 14, 0, 1, 6, 4, 5, 12, 13, 9, 16)
- Cycle 3: (4, 2, 17, 13, 9, 11, 14, 15, 19, 7, 8, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has multiple chords, so it is not a chordal cycle.
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (16-8), so it forms a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 has multiple chords, so it is not a chordal cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, which is <16, (16, 8), 10, 7>. So, the final answer is [1].
