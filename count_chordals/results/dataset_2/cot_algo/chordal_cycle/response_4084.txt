Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 16) (22, 21) (22, 8) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 8) (6, 24) (6, 26) (6, 20) (9, 3) (9, 0) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 4) (8, 22) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 1) (27, 24) (27, 11) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 7) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 26) (1, 4) (26, 6) (26, 1) (26, 10) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 25) (19, 29) (19, 21) (19, 24) (19, 23) (11, 27) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 0) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 7) (17, 2) (17, 25) (17, 16) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 16) (23, 19) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 16) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 28) (7, 16) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 20) (16, 23) (16, 7) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 17) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 21) (10, 26) (10, 20) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 23) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 28) (29, 19) (29, 21) (21, 22) (21, 19) (21, 24) (21, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <3, 15, 1, 4, 8, 22>
2. <3, 15, 8, 4, 1, 26>
3. <3, 15, 7, 28, 11, 0, 9>
4. <3, 9, 0, 11, 27, 24, 6>
5. <4, 1, 26, 6, 24, 27, 11>
6. <16, 23, 19, 29, 21, 22, 8>
7. <16, 23, 19, 24, 6, 20, 10, 26>
8. <16, 7, 28, 11, 27, 24, 6, 20>
9. <16, 17, 25, 5, 13, 16, 20, 6>
10. <16, 13, 5, 4, 1, 26, 10, 20>
11. <16, 7, 2, 14, 3, 9, 0, 11>
12. <16, 20, 6, 24, 19, 29, 21, 22>
13. <16, 23, 14, 2, 7, 28, 11, 0>
14. <21, 22, 8, 15, 1, 4, 25, 17>

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <3, 15, 1, (4, 26), 8>
2. <16, 7, (28, 11), 27, 24>
3. <16, 23, (19, 24), 6, 20>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [3].
