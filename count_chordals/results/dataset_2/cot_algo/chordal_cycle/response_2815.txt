Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 3 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 5 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 8 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 5: 5 - 6 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 6: 5 - 7 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 7: 6 - 7 - 9 - 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <5, (7, 9), 6>
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <5, (7, 9), 6>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <6, (7, 9), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles in the graph. So, the final number inside brackets is [4].
