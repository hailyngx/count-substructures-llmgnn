    - <14, 15, (22, 20)>
    - <14, 16, (19, 25)>
    - <14, 24, (21, 3)>
    - <17, 19, (25, 27)>
    - <0, 29, (4, 8)>
    - <6, 7, (28, 13)>
    - <2, 18, (29, 4)>
    - <18, 4, (8, 26)>
    - <1, 12, (23, 0)>
    - <26, 8, (24, 21)>
    - <5, 27, (25, 19)>
    - <16, 19, (17, 9)>
    - <10, 15, (14, 16)>
    - <3, 10, (9, 17)>
