Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 8) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (5, 15) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 10) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 9) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 10) (15, 17) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 17) (18, 14) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 9) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 2) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 9) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, and the cycles with all existing edges are:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-12-0
- Cycle 2: 1-3-14-4
- Cycle 3: 1-14-18-9
- Cycle 4: 3-14-18-9
- Cycle 5: 4-8-6-10
- Cycle 6: 7-19-12-0
- Cycle 7: 9-10-6-8
- Cycle 8: 9-10-15-16
- Cycle 9: 9-14-18-13
- Cycle 10: 13-1-3-12

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-12-0 has exactly one chord (3, 12).
- Cycle 5: 4-8-6-10 has exactly one chord (8, 6).
- Cycle 8: 9-10-15-16 has exactly one chord (10, 15).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (3, 12), 0>
- <4, (8, 6), 10>
- <9, (10, 15), 16>
