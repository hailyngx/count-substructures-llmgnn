Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-4-8-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-9-0-4-8-5
        - Cycle 3: 5-9-4-2-5
        - Cycle 4: 5-9-0-2-5
        - Cycle 5: 5-9-4-0-5
        - Cycle 6: 5-6-1-8-5
        - Cycle 7: 6-1-3-8-6
        - Cycle 8: 6-1-0-4-6
        - Cycle 9: 1-3-8-4-1
        - Cycle 10: 1-3-5-2-1
        - Cycle 11: 1-2-4-8-1
        - Cycle 12: 1-2-0-7-1
        - Cycle 13: 3-5-2-1-3
        - Cycle 14: 4-9-0-2-4
        - Cycle 15: 4-9-5-2-4
        - Cycle 16: 8-4-2-0-8
        - Cycle 17: 8-4-9-5-8
        - Cycle 18: 8-4-9-0-8
        - Cycle 19: 8-4-1-6-8
        - Cycle 20: 8-4-0-2-8
        - Cycle 21: 8-1-6-5-8
        - Cycle 22: 8-1-0-9-8
        - Cycle 23: 8-1-3-5-8
        - Cycle 24: 8-1-2-4-8
        - Cycle 25: 2-5-3-1-2
        - Cycle 26: 2-5-9-4-2
        - Cycle 27: 2-0-1-6-2
        - Cycle 28: 2-0-4-8-2
        - Cycle 29: 2-0-7-2
        - Cycle 30: 0-9-5-4-0
        - Cycle 31: 0-9-4-8-0
        - Cycle 32: 0-9-5-3-0
        - Cycle 33: 0-1-6-8-0
        - Cycle 34: 0-1-2-5-0
        - Cycle 35: 0-1-8-4-0
        - Cycle 36: 7-0-9-5-7
        - Cycle 37: 7-0-2-5-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (9, 4), 8, 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (9, 0), 4, 8, 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (9, 4), 2, 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (9, 0), 2, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are [4] chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
