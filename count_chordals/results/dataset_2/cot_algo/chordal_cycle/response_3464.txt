Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 18) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 1) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 2) (16, 15) (16, 9) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 5) (19, 10) (19, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 18) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) (2, 15) (2, 6) (18, 8) (18, 3) (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (4, 7, 9, 15, 14, 10, 19, 1, 13, 17, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (8, 7, 9, 15, 14, 10, 1, 12, 10, 19, 1, 13, 17, 5, 11, 14, 15, 9, 7, 8)
        - Cycle 3: (7, 9, 16, 15, 2, 6, 4, 13, 1, 12, 10, 19, 1, 13, 17, 5, 11, 14, 15, 9)
        - Cycle 4: (15, 9, 7, 4, 6, 2, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - <Cycle 1, (4, 15)>
        - <Cycle 2, (8, 15)>
        - <Cycle 3, (7, 15)>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        There are [3] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
