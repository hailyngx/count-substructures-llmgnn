Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:  
- Cycle <0, 14, 2, 3, 5>
- Cycle <0, 12, 11, 9, 10>
- Cycle <1, 6, 4, 2, 3>
- Cycle <1, 6, 4, 7, 11>
- Cycle <1, 6, 4, 8, 7>
- Cycle <1, 8, 7, 13, 5>
- Cycle <1, 11, 7, 13, 5>
- Cycle <2, 4, 7, 11, 9>
- Cycle <2, 4, 7, 13, 5>
- Cycle <2, 4, 14, 10, 9>
- Cycle <2, 3, 5, 13, 7>
- Cycle <3, 5, 13, 7, 11>
- Cycle <3, 2, 4, 7, 11>
- Cycle <4, 6, 1, 8, 7>
- Cycle <4, 7, 11, 2, 14>
- Cycle <4, 7, 13, 5, 3>
- Cycle <7, 11, 2, 3, 5>
- Cycle <7, 13, 3, 2, 4>
- Cycle <9, 11, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle <9, 10, 14, 2, 4>
- Cycle <10, 0, 12, 11, 7>
- Cycle <10, 13, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle <11, 7, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle <11, 7, 13, 5, 10>
- Cycle <12, 0, 14, 4, 7>
- Cycle <12, 14, 2, 4, 7>
- Cycle <13, 7, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle <13, 5, 3, 2, 4>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:  
- Cycle <1, 6, 4, 7, 11> has a chord (4, 11)
- Cycle <1, 8, 7, 13, 5> has a chord (7, 5)
- Cycle <1, 11, 7, 13, 5> has a chord (7, 5)
- Cycle <2, 4, 14, 10, 9> has a chord (4, 10)
- Cycle <3, 5, 13, 7, 11> has a chord (7, 13)
- Cycle <4, 6, 1, 8, 7> has a chord (1, 8)
- Cycle <4, 7, 11, 2, 14> has a chord (11, 2)
- Cycle <7, 11, 2, 3, 5> has a chord (11, 3)
- Cycle <9, 10, 14, 2, 4> has a chord (10, 2)
- Cycle <10, 0, 12, 11, 7> has a chord (0, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:  
There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
