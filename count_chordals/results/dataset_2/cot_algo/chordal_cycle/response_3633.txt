Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 3, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 3, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 4, 8, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 4, 9, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 3, 1, 9)
- Cycle 8: (6, 3, 9, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 7, 2, 6)
- Cycle 10: (1, 3, 9, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 12: (3, 1, 5, 3)
- Cycle 13: (3, 6, 2, 3)
- Cycle 14: (4, 8, 2, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 9, 5, 4)
- Cycle 16: (8, 2, 6, 8)
- Cycle 17: (8, 0, 1, 8)
- Cycle 18: (2, 6, 7, 2)
- Cycle 19: (2, 1, 3, 2)
- Cycle 20: (2, 7, 0, 2)
- Cycle 21: (0, 1, 5, 0)
- Cycle 22: (0, 8, 4, 0)
- Cycle 23: (7, 2, 6, 7)
- Cycle 24: (7, 0, 1, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (2, 5), 3>
<2, (1, 6), 3>
<2, (1, 7), 8>
<3, (1, 9), 6>
<5, (6, 9), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles is [5].
