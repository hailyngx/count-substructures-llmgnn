Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 12) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 2) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 18) (14, 6) (14, 13) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 15) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 17) (15, 7) (15, 16) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 17) (4, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  

1. Cycle: (0, 9, 5, 18, 11, 4, 11, 0)  
2. Cycle: (1, 7, 19, 17, 0, 13, 14, 6, 1)  
3. Cycle: (1, 7, 19, 17, 16, 8, 2, 1)  
4. Cycle: (1, 6, 14, 13, 0, 17, 16, 8, 2, 1)  
5. Cycle: (2, 19, 17, 0, 12, 3, 11, 18, 7, 1, 2)  
6. Cycle: (4, 11, 3, 12, 17, 0, 13, 14, 6, 1, 7, 18, 5, 9, 19, 2)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).  

From the above cycles, only the last cycle (cycle 6) has exactly one chord: (2, 9).  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].  

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, 11, 3, 12, 17> with a chord (2, 9).
