Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 2-6-1-8-2
        - Cycle 2: 2-7-6-1-2
        - Cycle 3: 2-7-8-1-2
        - Cycle 4: 5-2-6-7-5
        - Cycle 5: 5-4-0-7-5
        - Cycle 6: 5-0-3-7-5
        - Cycle 7: 5-3-9-4-5
        - Cycle 8: 6-1-8-7-6
        - Cycle 9: 6-7-0-9-6
        - Cycle 10: 6-2-7-0-6
        - Cycle 11: 7-6-1-8-7
        - Cycle 12: 7-8-9-0-7
        - Cycle 13: 7-0-5-3-7
        - Cycle 14: 7-3-9-1-7
        - Cycle 15: 0-5-2-7-0
        - Cycle 16: 0-7-6-1-0
        - Cycle 17: 0-3-9-4-0
        - Cycle 18: 3-5-2-6-3
        - Cycle 19: 3-0-7-8-3
        - Cycle 20: 3-7-2-5-3
        - Cycle 21: 3-9-4-1-3
        - Cycle 22: 4-5-0-9-4
        - Cycle 23: 4-0-7-1-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        <5, (4, 0), 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        There is one unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
