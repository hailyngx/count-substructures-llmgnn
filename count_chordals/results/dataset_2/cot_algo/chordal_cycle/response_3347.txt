Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 24) (22, 1) (18, 22) (18, 24) (18, 29) (12, 10) (12, 21) (27, 28) (27, 26) (27, 19) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 14) (24, 22) (24, 18) (24, 1) (24, 25) (26, 27) (26, 21) (26, 3) (7, 25) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (25, 24) (25, 7) (25, 11) (11, 25) (11, 23) (11, 8) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (23, 0) (8, 11) (8, 19) (19, 27) (19, 8) (3, 26) (3, 0) (3, 4) (28, 27) (28, 1) (0, 23) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 23) (5, 0) (5, 4) (16, 2) (16, 29) (16, 10) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 29) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 10) (15, 6) (15, 21) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 10) (10, 12) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) (29, 18) (29, 16) (29, 4) (1, 22) (1, 24) (1, 7) (1, 28) (1, 10) (14, 2) (14, 23) (14, 20) (20, 14) (21, 12) (21, 26) (21, 4) (21, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: <6, 2, 14, 23, 5, 7>
        - Cycle 2: <10, 12, 21, 26, 27, 19, 8, 11, 25, 7>
        - Cycle 3: <10, 1, 7, 25, 11, 23, 14, 2>
        - Cycle 4: <10, 1, 7, 5, 23, 11, 8, 19, 27, 26>
        - Cycle 5: <10, 1, 24, 18, 29, 16, 2, 14, 23, 11>
        - Cycle 6: <10, 1, 22, 18, 24, 25, 11, 8, 19, 27>
        - Cycle 7: <10, 1, 22, 18, 24, 25, 7, 5, 23, 11>
        - Cycle 8: <10, 1, 22, 13, 27, 26, 21, 12>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - <10, 1, 7, 5, 23, 11, 8, (19), 27, 26> (Chord: 19)
        - <10, (1), 22, 18, 24, 25, 11, 8, 19, 27> (Chord: 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are [6] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
