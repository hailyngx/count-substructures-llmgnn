Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 2) (8, 19) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 0) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 4) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 16) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 6) (0, 13) (0, 18) (0, 6) (5, 16) (15, 13) (15, 10) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 9) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 9) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 16) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 13, 0)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 6, 17)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 18, 1)
- Cycle 4: (4, 2, 19, 1)
- Cycle 5: (4, 2, 17, 6)
- Cycle 6: (4, 2, 19, 8)
- Cycle 7: (4, 2, 12, 16)
- Cycle 8: (7, 4, 3, 9)
- Cycle 9: (7, 4, 16, 10)
- Cycle 10: (7, 4, 2, 17)
- Cycle 11: (7, 6, 17, 14)
- Cycle 12: (7, 6, 0, 13)
- Cycle 13: (7, 18, 1, 11)
- Cycle 14: (13, 7, 4, 2)
- Cycle 15: (13, 7, 18, 1)
- Cycle 16: (13, 7, 6, 0)
- Cycle 17: (1, 11, 6, 17)
- Cycle 18: (1, 11, 10, 16)
- Cycle 19: (1, 19, 2, 4)
- Cycle 20: (1, 19, 8, 2)
- Cycle 21: (1, 18, 0, 6)
- Cycle 22: (3, 4, 2, 17)
- Cycle 23: (3, 4, 16, 10)
- Cycle 24: (3, 9, 19, 2)
- Cycle 25: (10, 11, 6, 17)
- Cycle 26: (10, 11, 1, 18)
- Cycle 27: (10, 16, 4, 2)
- Cycle 28: (10, 16, 12, 2)
- Cycle 29: (11, 1, 19, 8)
- Cycle 30: (11, 6, 17, 14)
- Cycle 31: (0, 13, 7, 4)
- Cycle 32: (0, 13, 15, 10)
- Cycle 33: (0, 18, 1, 11)
- Cycle 34: (5, 16, 4, 2)
- Cycle 35: (15, 13, 7, 4)
- Cycle 36: (15, 13, 0, 18)
- Cycle 37: (19, 8, 2, 4)
- Cycle 38: (19, 1, 18, 0)
- Cycle 39: (19, 1, 11, 6)
- Cycle 40: (2, 4, 16, 10)
- Cycle 41: (2, 17, 6, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (4, 2), 19>
- <2, (4, 7), 17>
- <3, (7, 4), 9>
- <4, (11, 1), 19>
- <5, (10, 16), 2>
- <6, (7, 18), 1>
- <7, (13, 7), 4>
- <8, (13, 15), 0>
- <9, (19, 8), 2>
- <10, (1, 18), 0>
- <11, (4, 16), 10>
- <12, (13, 0), 18>
- <13, (6, 17), 14>
- <14, (2, 12), 16>
- <15, (17, 6), 0>
- <16, (3, 9), 19>
- <17, (18, 0), 1>
- <18, (15, 13), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 18 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, so the final answer is [18].
