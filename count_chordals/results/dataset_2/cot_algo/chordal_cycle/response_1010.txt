Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (16, 17) (13, 22) (13, 20) (13, 24) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 10) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 14) (9, 29) (9, 2) (9, 15) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 26) (20, 13) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 14) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 2) (24, 13) (24, 28) (24, 4) (26, 0) (26, 20) (26, 2) (26, 27) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 19) (1, 8) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 7) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 27) (10, 22) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 18) (21, 5) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 23) (19, 1) (19, 15) (7, 28) (7, 15) (7, 29) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 26) (2, 4) (4, 24) (4, 2) (17, 16) (27, 22) (27, 26) (27, 29) (23, 15) (23, 21) (23, 14) (23, 25) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 6) (6, 12) (25, 1) (25, 23) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 8) (8, 1) (8, 18) (14, 5) (14, 20) (14, 23) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more where every edge in the cycle exists:

1. <5, 12, 10, 21, 5>
2. <5, 12, 14, 23, 5>
3. <5, 21, 23, 14, 5>
4. <9, 29, 27, 26, 9>
5. <13, 18, 10, 22, 13>
6. <13, 18, 10, 21, 13>
7. <13, 18, 8, 1, 13>
8. <13, 20, 14, 23, 13>
9. <15, 19, 1, 29, 15>
10. <15, 19, 1, 8, 15>
11. <15, 19, 1, 25, 15>
12. <15, 19, 1, 15, 15> (Self-loop)
13. <15, 19, 1, 15, 29, 27, 26, 2, 28, 7, 15> (Big cycle not possible for chordal 4-cycle)
14. <28, 11, 7, 15, 29, 1, 8, 18, 10, 21, 5, 12, 14, 20, 0, 26, 27, 22, 13, 18, 10, 12, 5, 14, 23, 25, 1, 15, 7, 28>
15. <24, 4, 2, 9, 29, 1, 15, 7, 28, 11, 7, 15, 9, 2, 26, 0, 20, 13, 22, 10, 12, 5, 14, 20, 26, 27, 29, 15, 1, 19, 8, 18, 13, 24>
16. <26, 27, 22, 13, 20, 14, 5, 21, 10, 18, 8, 1, 19, 15, 7, 28, 2, 4, 24, 13>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

<13, 18, 10, 21, 13> has a chord (18, 21)
<13, 18, 8, 1, 13> has a chord (18, 1)
<13, 20, 14, 23, 13> has a chord (20, 23)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found = 16 - 3 = 13

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13].
