Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0-9-7-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-9-7-6-2-0
- Cycle 3: 3-1-6-7-3
- Cycle 4: 3-1-6-7-0-3
- Cycle 5: 5-3-1-6-5
- Cycle 6: 5-3-1-6-2-5
- Cycle 7: 5-3-1-8-5
- Cycle 8: 5-3-1-8-2-5
- Cycle 9: 5-3-6-7-5
- Cycle 10: 5-3-6-7-0-5

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (9, 7), 6, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (9, 6), 2, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (1, 6), 7, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, (1, 7), 0, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (3, 1), 6, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, (3, 6), 2, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, (3, 8), 1, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, (3, 1), 8, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <3, (6, 7), 5, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <3, (6, 7), 0, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are [10] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
