Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 8) (16, 19) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 13) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 8) (27, 5) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 9) (23, 22) (23, 28) (23, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 24) (4, 8) (4, 21) (8, 16) (8, 27) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 28) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 19) (14, 0) (14, 27) (17, 26) (17, 2) (29, 7) (29, 28) (29, 5) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 18) (9, 22) (9, 23) (9, 7) (9, 24) (9, 3) (28, 23) (28, 8) (28, 29) (6, 11) (6, 21) (21, 4) (21, 6) (21, 3) (21, 25) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 26) (18, 13) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 19) (25, 21) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 3) (15, 20) (2, 17) (5, 27) (5, 12) (5, 29) (1, 10) (20, 15) (20, 24) (24, 10) (24, 9) (24, 20) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
<0, 27, 5, 12> 
<0, 18, 26, 22> 
<0, 27, 8, 16> 
<0, 27, 18, 13> 
<0, 27, 8, 4> 
<0, 13, 11, 6> 
<0, 13, 18, 26> 
<0, 14, 27, 8> 
<7, 9, 22, 26> 
<7, 18, 26, 22> 
<7, 18, 26, 17> 
<7, 29, 5, 27> 
<7, 29, 28, 8> 
<7, 29, 28, 23> 
<7, 29, 5, 12> 
<12, 7, 0, 13> 
<12, 7, 0, 18> 
<12, 19, 16, 8> 
<14, 0, 27, 8> 
<16, 19, 12, 7> 
<16, 8, 27, 0> 
<16, 8, 4, 21> 
<16, 8, 27, 18> 
<16, 8, 10, 1> 
<19, 12, 7, 0> 
<19, 3, 21, 4> 
<21, 6, 11, 13> 
<21, 3, 9, 22> 
<21, 3, 19, 16> 
<21, 25, 3, 9> 
<22, 26, 18, 27> 
<22, 26, 17, 2> 
<23, 28, 8, 27> 
<24, 20, 15, 1> 

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
<0, 27, 8, 16> 
<0, 13, 11, 6> 
<16, 8, 27, 0> 
<16, 8, 4, 21> 
<7, 18, 26, 22> 
<7, 29, 28, 8> 
<12, 19, 16, 8> 
<19, 3, 21, 4> 
<21, 6, 11, 13> 
<21, 3, 9, 22> 

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [10]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<0, 27, 5, 12> 
<0, 27, 18, 13> 
<0, 13, 18, 26> 
<0, 14, 27, 8> 
<7, 9, 22, 26> 
<7, 18, 26, 17> 
<7, 29, 5, 27> 
<7, 29, 28, 23> 
<7, 29, 5, 12> 
<12, 7, 0, 13>
