Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 21) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 15) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 28) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 27) (3, 18) (3, 29) (17, 16) (17, 29) (17, 24) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 10) (22, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 20) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 15) (27, 3) (27, 14) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 27) (14, 26) (14, 25) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 15) (21, 11) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 2) (10, 1) (10, 29) (10, 19) (19, 10) (8, 5) (8, 25) (28, 5) (28, 2) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 28) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 6) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 24) (23, 9) (23, 18) (23, 13) (23, 12) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 26) (13, 23) (13, 25) (25, 29) (25, 14) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 13) (6, 11) (6, 20) (6, 12) (12, 0) (12, 23) (12, 6) (24, 17) (24, 4) (24, 18) 

Response:

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycles: None

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [52].
