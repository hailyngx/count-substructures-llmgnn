Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more are: 
- Cycle 1: 8-13-1-8
- Cycle 2: 8-3-9-13-8
- Cycle 3: 8-12-6-7-8
- Cycle 4: 8-1-13-0-8
- Cycle 5: 8-7-5-12-8
- Cycle 6: 13-9-3-11-13
- Cycle 7: 13-0-10-12-13
- Cycle 8: 3-11-6-12-3
- Cycle 9: 3-14-7-5-3
- Cycle 10: 11-6-7-14-11
- Cycle 11: 4-10-0-5-4

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are: 
- <1, (13, 9), 8>
- <3, (8, 13), 9>
- <6, (7, 12), 8>
- <0, (10, 13), 12>
- <7, (1, 5), 8>
- <3, (9, 11), 13>
- <5, (3, 7), 12>
- <7, (6, 14), 11>
- <0, (5, 10), 13>
- <4, (0, 10), 12>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
