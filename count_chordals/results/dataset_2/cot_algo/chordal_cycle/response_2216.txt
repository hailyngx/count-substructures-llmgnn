Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 23) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 28) (9, 16) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 29) (25, 3) (25, 13) (25, 18) (25, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 27) (8, 6) (8, 20) (8, 17) (13, 25) (13, 4) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 2) (27, 21) (27, 0) (27, 2) (22, 26) (22, 11) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 23) (24, 3) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 1) (1, 24) (1, 14) (1, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (18, 25) (18, 26) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 15) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 26) (16, 9) (16, 7) (5, 26) (5, 29) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 12) (29, 3) (29, 7) (29, 5) (28, 9) (28, 0) (12, 24) (12, 19) (12, 14) (20, 8) (20, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 10) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 27) (2, 20) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 28, 0, 27, 21, 7, 16, 9)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 16, 7, 21, 27, 0, 28, 9)
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 16, 7, 29, 5, 26, 22, 11, 15, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 9, 16, 7, 29, 3, 25, 13, 4, 17, 8, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 9, 16, 7, 23, 26, 24, 3, 25, 13, 4, 17, 8, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 15, 11, 22, 26, 24, 3, 25, 10, 1, 14, 12, 19, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1: Contains a chord (9, 0)
- Cycle 2: Contains a chord (9, 28)
- Cycle 3: Contains a chord (29, 11)
- Cycle 4: Contains a chord (16, 8)
- Cycle 5: Contains a chord (16, 23)
- Cycle 6: Contains a chord (15, 26)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found, so the final count is [0].
