Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 3, 6, 4, 9)
- Cycle 3: (5, 1, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 7, 3, 9, 1)
- Cycle 6: (3, 6, 0, 4, 3)
- Cycle 7: (6, 9, 8, 1, 6)
- Cycle 8: (4, 7, 2, 1, 4)
- Cycle 9: (7, 3, 0, 6, 7)
- Cycle 10: (2, 8, 9, 1, 2)
- Cycle 11: (8, 1, 7, 2, 8)
- Cycle 12: (0, 4, 7, 3, 0)
- Cycle 13: (6, 0, 2, 8, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 3: (5, 1, 7, 4, 5) has one chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 9, 5, 1) has one chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 6: (3, 6, 0, 4, 3) has one chord: (3, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 7, 2, 1, 4) has one chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 12: (0, 4, 7, 3, 0) has one chord: (0, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 13 cycles in total, and 5 of them have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles is 13 - 5 = 8. 

So, the final answer is [8]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<3, (4, 1), 0>
