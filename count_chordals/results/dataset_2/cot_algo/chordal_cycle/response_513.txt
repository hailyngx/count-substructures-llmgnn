Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 
Here are the cycles:
1. (4, 7, 9, 6, 4)
2. (4, 3, 8, 7, 4)
3. (7, 1, 5, 6, 7)
4. (1, 9, 6, 5, 1)
5. (1, 7, 0, 9, 1)
6. (6, 0, 7, 8, 6)
7. (9, 0, 1, 7, 9)
8. (5, 8, 7, 1, 5)
9. (0, 6, 9, 7, 0)
10. (8, 5, 6, 9, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Only cycle 6, (6, 0, 7, 8, 6), has exactly one chord (7, 8). Thus, we have one chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since we found 1 chordal 4-cycle, the number to put inside brackets is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<6, (7, 8), 0>
