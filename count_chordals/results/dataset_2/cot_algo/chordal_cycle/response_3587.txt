Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 11) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 2: 4 - 5 - 9 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 13 - 14 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 4: 7 - 6 - 3 - 0 - 7
- Cycle 5: 1 - 0 - 3 - 14 - 1
- Cycle 6: 2 - 3 - 6 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 7: 8 - 12 - 7 - 6 - 8
- Cycle 8: 10 - 4 - 13 - 14 - 10
- Cycle 9: 11 - 8 - 12 - 1 - 11
- Cycle 10: 2 - 9 - 8 - 11 - 2
- Cycle 11: 10 - 0 - 1 - 11 - 10
- Cycle 12: 13 - 6 - 9 - 5 - 13
- Cycle 13: 2 - 12 - 8 - 9 - 2
- Cycle 14: 10 - 14 - 3 - 2 - 10
- Cycle 15: 13 - 14 - 0 - 3 - 13

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 7 - 5 has exactly one chord 6-7
- Cycle 3: 4 - 13 - 14 - 1 - 4 has exactly one chord 13-1
- Cycle 6: 2 - 3 - 6 - 7 - 2 has exactly one chord 3-7
- Cycle 7: 8 - 12 - 7 - 6 - 8 has exactly one chord 12-6
- Cycle 10: 2 - 9 - 8 - 11 - 2 has exactly one chord 9-11

Step 3:
Number of unique chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, (6, 7)>
<4, 13, 14, 1, (13, 1)>
<2, 3, 6, 7, (3, 7)>
<8, 12, 7, 6, (12, 6)>
<2, 9, 8, 11, (9, 11)>
