Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- (5, 9, 9, 5)
- (5, 9, 9, 6)
- (5, 9, 9, 7)
- (5, 9, 9, 1)
- (5, 9, 9, 0)
- (5, 9, 9, 8)
- (9, 6, 6, 5)
- (9, 6, 6, 3)
- (9, 6, 6, 2)
- (9, 6, 6, 4)
- (9, 6, 6, 0)
- (5, 7, 7, 4)
- (5, 7, 7, 0)
- (5, 7, 7, 2)
- (5, 1, 1, 8)
- (9, 0, 0, 6)
- (9, 0, 0, 7)
- (9, 0, 0, 8)
- (6, 3, 3, 8)
- (6, 4, 4, 7)
- (1, 8, 8, 3)

Step 2:
- <5, 9, 1, (5, 9)>
- <5, 9, 0, (5, 9)>
- <5, 9, 7, (5, 9)>
- <9, 6, 4, (6, 4)>
- <5, 7, 2, (7, 2)>
- <5, 1, 8, (1, 8)>
- <9, 0, 6, (0, 6)>
- <9, 0, 7, (0, 7)>
- <9, 0, 8, (0, 8)>
- <6, 3, 8, (3, 8)>
- <6, 4, 7, (4, 7)>
- <1, 8, 3, (8, 3)>

Step 3:
After checking for exactly one chord in each cycle, we find that there are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the final count is [11].
