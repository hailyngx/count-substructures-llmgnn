Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 0 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 9 - 7 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 9 - 4 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 5: 5 - 2 - 4 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 6: 5 - 2 - 7 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 7: 5 - 1 - 0 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 8: 5 - 1 - 2 - 6 - 5

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chord (4, 7) => <1, (4, 7), 5>
- Cycle 2: Chord (0, 8) => <2, (0, 8), 5>
- Cycle 3: Chord (7, 2) => <3, (7, 2), 5>
- Cycle 4: Chord (4, 6) => <4, (4, 6), 5>
- Cycle 5: Chord (2, 4) => <5, (2, 4), 5>
- Cycle 6: Chord (2, 7) => <6, (2, 7), 5>
- Cycle 7: Chord (1, 3) => <7, (1, 3), 5>
- Cycle 8: Chord (1, 6) => <8, (1, 6), 5>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
