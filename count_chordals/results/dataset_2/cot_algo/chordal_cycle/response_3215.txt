Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 27) (1, 21) (1, 5) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 2) (14, 28) (17, 20) (17, 7) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 12) (22, 7) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 27) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 11) (13, 10) (15, 18) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 29) (27, 26) (27, 8) (27, 15) (27, 29) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (4, 8) (4, 28) (11, 13) (11, 28) (28, 14) (28, 4) (28, 11) (28, 5) (20, 17) (20, 29) (7, 17) (7, 22) (7, 25) (7, 3) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 6) (25, 24) (29, 9) (29, 15) (29, 27) (29, 20) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 2) (19, 15) (19, 6) (12, 18) (12, 16) (24, 9) (24, 25) (24, 16) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (6, 25) (6, 19) (6, 23) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 28) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 23) (23, 6) (23, 10) (2, 21) (2, 16) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- <1, 21, 13, 8, 1>
- <1, 21, 2, 10, 23, 6, 19, 15, 18, 12, 16, 2>
- <1, 21, 13, 10, 2, 16, 12, 18, 15, 27, 29, 20, 17, 7, 22, 7>
- <1, 21, 13, 11, 28, 4, 8, 13>
- <1, 5, 0, 1>
- <1, 5, 28, 4, 8, 13, 21, 1>
- <21, 2, 16, 12, 18, 15, 27, 29, 9, 26, 27, 15, 19, 6, 25, 7, 17, 20, 29, 15>
- <21, 13, 25, 7, 17, 20, 29, 27, 15, 18, 9, 26, 27, 8, 4, 28, 11, 13>
- <28, 11, 13, 10, 2, 21, 1, 0, 5, 28>
- <7, 17, 20, 29, 27, 8, 4, 28, 11, 13, 21, 1, 5, 0, 3, 7>
- <7, 17, 20, 29, 15, 18, 12, 16, 2, 21, 13, 11, 28, 5, 1, 21>
- <7, 22, 7, 25, 6, 23, 10, 13, 21, 2, 16, 12, 18, 15, 27, 29>

Step 2:

The unique chordal 4-cycle is: 
- <1, 21, 13, 8, 1>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
