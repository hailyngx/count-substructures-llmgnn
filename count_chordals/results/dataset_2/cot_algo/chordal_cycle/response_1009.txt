Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 3) (26, 9) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 25) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 1) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 21) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 28) (17, 12) (17, 20) (17, 3) (17, 7) (20, 17) (20, 22) (20, 14) (20, 24) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 23) (0, 6) (7, 27) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 0) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (16, 19) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 28) (18, 0) (18, 29) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 17) (24, 8) (24, 20) (24, 19) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 23) (11, 1) (11, 22) (11, 21) (23, 0) (23, 15) (23, 1) (29, 18) (29, 22) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 24) (19, 6) (22, 20) (22, 11) (22, 29) (22, 28) (6, 0) (6, 19) (28, 13) (28, 25) (28, 22) (21, 4) (21, 5) (21, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 7-27-12-5-7
- Cycle 2: 3-9-26-12-3
- Cycle 3: 4-8-1-23-15-10-13-4
- Cycle 4: 3-13-10-14-20-17-3
- Cycle 5: 19-12-17-20-24-19

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 (Chordal 4-cycle 1): Chord between 12 and 5
- Cycle 2 (Chordal 4-cycle 2): Chord between 9 and 26
- Cycle 3 (Chordal 4-cycle 3): Chord between 8 and 1
- Cycle 4 (Chordal 4-cycle 4): Chord between 13 and 10
- Cycle 5 (Chordal 4-cycle 5): Chord between 12 and 17

Step 3:
Total number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <7, 27, 12, 5> (Chord: (12, 5))
2. <3, 9, 26, 12> (Chord: (9, 26))
3. <4, 8, 1, 23> (Chord: (8, 1))
4. <3, 13, 10, 14> (Chord: (13, 10))
5. <19, 12, 17, 20> (Chord: (12, 17))
