Step 2:
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following chordal 4-cycle: 
<1, 5, 6, 13>
<1, 5, 25, 9>
<1, 8, 4, 15>
<1, 9, 18, 16>
<1, 9, 25, 12>
<1, 9, 27, 14>
<1, 23, 5, 29>
<2, 12, 25, 9>
<2, 12, 29, 10>
<2, 22, 3, 10>
<2, 22, 21, 4>
<4, 8, 19, 15>
<5, 6, 13, 26>
<5, 25, 12, 29>
<6, 5, 25, 12>
<6, 13, 26, 17>
<6, 15, 19, 8>
<7, 10, 3, 22>
<9, 18, 16, 21>
<9, 25, 5, 1>
<10, 3, 22, 21>
<10, 7, 19, 8>
<10, 24, 21, 26>
<11, 18, 9, 1>
<14, 7, 10, 3>
<14, 20, 0, 29>
<14, 27, 9, 1>
<16, 18, 9, 1>
<16, 21, 22, 2>
<17, 26, 21, 4>
<18, 9, 1, 5>
<19, 8, 1, 5>
<21, 16, 18, 9>
<21, 22, 3, 10>
<21, 24, 10, 3>
<22, 3, 10, 29>
<22, 21, 4, 15>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we get a total of [35].
