Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 6 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 7 - 4 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 3: 2 - 3 - 5 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 4: 3 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 5: 4 - 6 - 7 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 6: 6 - 8 - 9 - 7 - 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (0, 8) and (4, 6)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 3 has 0 chords
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (3, 4)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (8, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 4, 6, 8> with chord (4, 6)
- <1, 7, 4, 8> with chord (4, 8)
- <3, 9, 4, 7> with chord (3, 4)
