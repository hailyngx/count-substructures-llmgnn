    Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 6, 14, 7, 5> (Chord: (6, 7))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 11, 0, 6, 5> (Chord: (11, 0))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 16, 12, 13, 5> (Chord: (12, 13))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6, 3, 19, 16, 6> (Chord: (3, 16))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, 14, 10, 9, 6> (Chord: (10, 9))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, 0, 7, 1, 6> (Chord: (0, 7))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <0, 6, 5, 11, 0> (Chord: (5, 11))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <7, 14, 6, 0, 7> (Chord: (6, 0))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <7, 13, 12, 1, 7> (Chord: (12, 13))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <1, 2, 4, 16, 1> (Chord: (2, 16))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <1, 0, 11, 5, 1> (Chord: (5, 11))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <1, 12, 16, 5, 1> (Chord: (12, 16))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <8, 0, 6, 5, 8> (Chord: (6, 5))

    Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are [13] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
