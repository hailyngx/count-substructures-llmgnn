Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 3) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 16) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (11, 17) (11, 1) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 5) (14, 8) (15, 7) (16, 4) (16, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 4-7-10-17-4
        - Cycle 2: 3-10-17-13-3
        - Cycle 3: 3-18-4-16-3
        - Cycle 4: 1-4-18-3-1
        - Cycle 5: 1-4-7-10-1
        - Cycle 6: 1-5-19-6-1
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Cycle 1 (4-7-10-17-4) has a chord: (7, 17)
        - Cycle 2 (3-10-17-13-3) has a chord: (10, 13)
        - Cycle 3 (3-18-4-16-3) has a chord: (18, 16)
        - Cycle 4 (1-4-18-3-1) has a chord: (4, 3)
        - Cycle 5 (1-4-7-10-1) has a chord: (4, 10)
        - Cycle 6 (1-5-19-6-1) has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [1].

        The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (4, 10), 5>.
