Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (14, 7) (14, 11) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6-5-2-7-6
- Cycle 2: 6-5-11-7-6
- Cycle 3: 6-11-14-7-6
- Cycle 4: 6-11-12-7-6
- Cycle 5: 6-13-10-12-6
- Cycle 6: 9-3-5-2-9
- Cycle 7: 9-3-12-7-9
- Cycle 8: 9-3-8-0-9
- Cycle 9: 9-13-6-4-9
- Cycle 10: 4-6-11-7-4
- Cycle 11: 4-6-13-10-4
- Cycle 12: 4-7-14-11-4
- Cycle 13: 4-7-12-10-4
- Cycle 14: 7-12-10-8-7
- Cycle 15: 7-12-3-9-7
- Cycle 16: 7-12-2-5-7
- Cycle 17: 7-14-11-6-7
- Cycle 18: 8-10-13-9-8
- Cycle 19: 8-10-12-7-8
- Cycle 20: 8-10-0-9-8

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, (5, 7), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, (5, 7), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, (11, 7), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, (11, 7), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, (13, 10), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle <9, (3, 5), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle <9, (3, 12), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle <9, (3, 8), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle <9, (13, 6), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, (6, 11), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, (6, 13), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, (7, 14), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, (7, 12), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, (12, 10), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, (12, 3), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, (12, 2), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, (14, 11), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle <8, (10, 13), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle <8, (10, 12), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle <8, (10, 0), 9>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [21]
