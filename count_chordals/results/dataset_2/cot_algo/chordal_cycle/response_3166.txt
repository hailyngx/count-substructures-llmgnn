Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1-3-7-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-12-9-11-1
- Cycle 3: 2-13-3-1-2
- Cycle 4: 2-13-8-4-7-3-6-2
- Cycle 5: 4-13-5-10-1-11-9-4
- Cycle 6: 4-13-5-10-14-0-6-12-3-7-4

Step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <4, 13, 5, 10>
- <4, 13, 5, 10> (chords: (1, 11))
- <4, 13, 5, 10> (chords: (9, 11))
- <4, 13, 5, 10> (chords: (0, 14))
- <4, 13, 5, 10> (chords: (1, 6))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
