Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 8) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 5) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (2, 12) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 15) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 19) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 7) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 0) (15, 5) (15, 16) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (16, 15) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 19) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (12, 2) (12, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-4-6-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-4-6-5-19-17-2-11-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-4-8-13-7-2-11-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-5-19-17-2-11-0-10-1
- Cycle 5: 1-3-5-19-7-13-8-4-10-1
- Cycle 6: 1-3-4-8-14-13-7-2-11-1
- Cycle 7: 1-3-4-11-2-7-13-8-4-1
- Cycle 8: 1-3-4-11-0-10-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-4-6-5-1 (Chord: 3-5)
- Cycle 4: 1-3-5-19-17-2-11-0-10-1 (Chord: 19-11)
- Cycle 5: 1-3-5-19-7-13-8-4-10-1 (Chord: 13-4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [5] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 3, 4, 6, 5> with chord (3, 5)
<1, 3, 5, 19, 17, 2, 11, 0, 10> with chord (19, 11)
<1, 3, 5, 19, 7, 13, 8, 4, 10> with chord (13, 4)
