2. (18, 22, 9, 10)
3. (22, 9, 12, 13)
4. (20, 25, 4, 14)
5. (10, 27, 6, 16)
6. (11, 7, 3, 22)
7. (1, 10, 9, 22)
8. (1, 17, 28, 14)
9. (1, 2, 5, 3)
10. (1, 16, 6, 27)

20. (21, 18, 22, 9)
21. (19, 15, 5, 3)
22. (3, 22, 18, 21)
23. (3, 7, 11, 17)
24. (3, 5, 2, 28)
25. (2, 1, 10, 9)
26. (2, 5, 15, 19)
27. (5, 3, 7, 11)
28. (5, 2, 1, 10)
29. (5, 29, 8, 14)
30. (15, 19, 4, 25)
31. (14, 20, 25, 29)
32. (14, 8, 29, 21)
33. (14, 28, 2, 1)
