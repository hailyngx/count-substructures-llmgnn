Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 11) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 12) (8, 15) (8, 5) (1, 16) (17, 16) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 16) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 18) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 7) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 18) (2, 10) (2, 19) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 10, 5)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 11, 14)
- Cycle 3: (3, 15, 8, 5)
- Cycle 4: (3, 15, 5, 8)
- Cycle 5: (15, 10, 13, 11)
- Cycle 6: (15, 10, 14, 11)
- Cycle 7: (15, 11, 14, 18)
- Cycle 8: (15, 11, 13, 10)
- Cycle 9: (15, 8, 5, 10)
- Cycle 10: (15, 8, 5, 3)
- Cycle 11: (15, 5, 3, 7)
- Cycle 12: (15, 5, 10, 13)
- Cycle 13: (5, 8, 15, 10)
- Cycle 14: (5, 10, 13, 11)
- Cycle 15: (5, 10, 15, 11)
- Cycle 16: (9, 14, 11, 13)
- Cycle 17: (9, 14, 10, 15)
- Cycle 18: (9, 14, 11, 15)
- Cycle 19: (4, 12, 9, 14)
- Cycle 20: (9, 12, 4, 12)
  
Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are: 
- <1, (3, 15), 4> 
- <2, (3, 15), 14> 
- <3, (3, 15), 8> 
- <4, (3, 15), 5> 
- <5, (3, 15), 11> 
- <6, (3, 15), 10> 
- <7, (3, 15), 13> 
- <8, (3, 15), 18> 
  
Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final count is [8].
