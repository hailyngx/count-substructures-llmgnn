Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 7) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 25) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 16) (27, 4) (27, 23) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 28) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (0, 7) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 12) (21, 10) (21, 2) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 6) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 20) (18, 7) (13, 26) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 23) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 29) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 5) (4, 27) (4, 11) (4, 28) (23, 27) (23, 13) (23, 6) (8, 20) (8, 6) (19, 9) (19, 29) (22, 16) (22, 20) (29, 9) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 29) (24, 11) (28, 14) (28, 4) (28, 25) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 23) (6, 8) (6, 16) (20, 18) (20, 8) (20, 22) (25, 26) (25, 28) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 16) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 22) (16, 6) (16, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <9, 26, 13, 14>
- <9, 26, 25, 28>
- <15, 1, 13, 29>
- <15, 1, 12, 29>
- <15, 12, 13, 29>
- <27, 4, 11, 6>
- <17, 14, 13, 1>
- <17, 14, 3, 29>
- <17, 14, 13, 12>
- <10, 17, 14, 13>
- <10, 17, 14, 3>
- <10, 21, 2, 17>
- <13, 1, 15, 12>
- <13, 1, 12, 29>
- <13, 12, 15, 1>
- <13, 12, 29, 1>
- <13, 12, 29, 9>
- <13, 14, 17, 10>
- <13, 14, 17, 2>
- <13, 14, 3, 29>
- <13, 14, 3, 16>
- <1, 15, 12, 29>
- <1, 12, 15, 16>
- <1, 12, 15, 1>
- <1, 12, 29, 9>
- <1, 12, 29, 13>
- <1, 12, 29, 1>
- <1, 13, 14, 17>
- <1, 13, 14, 3>
- <21, 10, 17, 14>
- <21, 10, 17, 2>
- <14, 17, 10, 21>
- <14, 17, 2, 21>
- <14, 2, 21, 10>
- <14, 2, 21, 17>
- <14, 13, 26, 25>

Step 2:
- <9, 26, 13, 14>: (9, 13) is the chord.
- <15, 1, 12, 29>: (15, 12) is the chord.
- <27, 4, 11, 6>: (4, 11) is the chord.
- <17, 14, 13, 1>: (14, 1) is the chord.
- <10, 17, 14, 3>: (17, 3) is the chord.
- <13, 1, 15, 12>: (1, 15) is the chord.
- <13, 14, 17, 10>: (14, 17) is the chord.
- <13, 14, 17, 2>: (14, 17) is the chord.
- <1, 15, 12, 29>: (15, 12) is the chord.
- <21, 10, 17, 14>: (10, 17) is the chord.

Step 3:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the answer is [10].
