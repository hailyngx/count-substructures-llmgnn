Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.
        - Cycle 1: <0, 1, 8, 4, 0>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 1, 3, 6, 0>
        - Cycle 3: <0, 2, 3, 6, 0>
        - Cycle 4: <1, 3, 6, 7, 1>
        - Cycle 5: <1, 3, 9, 5, 1>
        - Cycle 6: <1, 3, 8, 4, 1>
        - Cycle 7: <1, 7, 6, 0, 1>
        - Cycle 8: <2, 3, 6, 7, 2>
        - Cycle 9: <3, 6, 7, 8, 3>
        - Cycle 10: <4, 8, 7, 6, 4>
        - Cycle 11: <4, 8, 1, 7, 4>
        - Cycle 12: <5, 9, 3, 1, 5>
        - Cycle 13: <5, 9, 4, 8, 5>
        - Cycle 14: <6, 7, 8, 4, 6>
        - Cycle 15: <7, 1, 8, 4, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - <1, 3, 9, 5, 1> has exactly one chord (3, 5) forming the chordal 4-cycle <1, (3, 5), 9>.
        - <1, 7, 6, 0, 1> has exactly one chord (6, 7) forming the chordal 4-cycle <1, (6, 7), 0>.
        - <2, 3, 6, 7, 2> has exactly one chord (3, 6) forming the chordal 4-cycle <2, (3, 6), 7>.
        - <3, 6, 7, 8, 3> has exactly one chord (6, 8) forming the chordal 4-cycle <3, (6, 8), 7>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [4].
