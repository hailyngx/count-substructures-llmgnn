Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:  
1. Cycle 5-1-3-5  
2. Cycle 5-1-2-5  
3. Cycle 5-0-9-6-5  
4. Cycle 5-3-7-4-5  
5. Cycle 9-6-2-1-9  
6. Cycle 9-6-4-7-9  
7. Cycle 9-7-3-5-9  
8. Cycle 9-7-4-8-9  
9. Cycle 6-2-3-7-6  
10. Cycle 6-2-4-8-6  
11. Cycle 1-3-7-9-1  
12. Cycle 1-8-4-6-1  
13. Cycle 3-7-9-0-3  
14. Cycle 3-2-1-8-3  
15. Cycle 4-7-9-0-4  
16. Cycle 4-8-1-5-4  
17. Cycle 7-3-1-5-7  
18. Cycle 7-4-6-2-7  
19. Cycle 8-1-5-0-8  
20. Cycle 8-4-6-2-8  

Step 2:  
The cycles with exactly one chord are:  
- <5, (1, 3), 5>  
- <5, (1, 2), 5>  
- <5, (0, 9), 5>  
- <5, (3, 7), 5>  
- <9, (6, 2), 9>  
- <9, (6, 4), 9>  
- <9, (7, 3), 9>  
- <9, (7, 4), 9>  
- <6, (2, 3), 6>  
- <6, (2, 4), 6>  
- <1, (3, 7), 1>  
- <1, (8, 4), 1>  
- <3, (7, 9), 3>  
- <3, (2, 1), 3>  
- <4, (7, 9), 4>  
- <4, (8, 1), 4>  
- <7, (3, 1), 7>  
- <7, (4, 6), 7>  
- <8, (1, 5), 8>  
- <8, (4, 6), 8>  

Step 3:  
There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final count is [20].
