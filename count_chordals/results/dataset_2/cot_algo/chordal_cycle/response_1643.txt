Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 7) (3, 27) (3, 24) (3, 10) (7, 27) (7, 17) (12, 15) (6, 21) (6, 17) (6, 29) (6, 19) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 2) (4, 27) (4, 28) (4, 20) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 26) (14, 11) (14, 20) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 0) (26, 17) (1, 9) (1, 22) (2, 21) (2, 26) (16, 22) (16, 5) (16, 20) (28, 4) (28, 13) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 13) (29, 6) (29, 18) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 26) (17, 19) (5, 16) (5, 23) (5, 25) (5, 22) (23, 5) (23, 0) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 17) (13, 21) (13, 9) (13, 28) (13, 11) (24, 3) (24, 18) (24, 25) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 24) (25, 0) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 22) (18, 29) (18, 24) (18, 10) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 20) (0, 26) (0, 23) (0, 25) (20, 4) (20, 14) (20, 16) (20, 22) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 15 - 27 - 3 - 10 - 15
- Cycle 2: 6 - 21 - 13 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 21 - 2 - 26 - 6
- Cycle 4: 9 - 13 - 11 - 14 - 9
- Cycle 5: 9 - 13 - 28 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 1 - 22 - 16 - 9
- Cycle 7: 26 - 2 - 21 - 6 - 26
- Cycle 8: 25 - 5 - 16 - 22 - 25
- Cycle 9: 25 - 9 - 13 - 21 - 25

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord 27-3
- Cycle 2 has one chord 21-2
- Cycle 3 has one chord 21-26
- Cycle 4 has one chord 13-11
- Cycle 5 has one chord 13-28

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
- <15, 27, 3, 10> with chord (27, 3)
- <6, 21, 13, 2> with chord (21, 2)
- <9, 13, 11, 14> with chord (13, 11)
- <9, 13, 28, 4> with chord (13, 28)
- <25, 5, 16, 22> with chord (5, 16)

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [5].
