Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-1-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-7-1-5
- Cycle 3: 5-6-1-7-5
- Cycle 4: 5-7-1-6-5
- Cycle 5: 9-8-6-1-9
- Cycle 6: 9-8-3-6-9
- Cycle 7: 4-2-8-6-4
- Cycle 8: 4-2-3-6-4
- Cycle 9: 8-2-3-6-8
- Cycle 10: 1-7-9-5-1

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (9, 1), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (9, 7), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (6, 1), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (7, 1), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (8, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, (8, 3), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, (2, 8), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, (2, 3), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <8, (2, 3), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <1, (7, 9), 5>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we get [10].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <5, (9, 1), 6>
- <5, (9, 7), 1>
- <5, (6, 1), 7>
- <5, (7, 1), 6>
- <9, (8, 6), 1>
- <9, (8, 3), 6>
- <4, (2, 8), 6>
- <4, (2, 3), 6>
- <8, (2, 3), 6>
- <1, (7, 9), 5>
