Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 0) (21, 5) (14, 4) (14, 29) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 9) (7, 23) (7, 8) (0, 21) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 6) (27, 19) (27, 13) (2, 18) (2, 3) (2, 28) (18, 0) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 6) (26, 24) (26, 12) (26, 4) (4, 14) (4, 26) (15, 19) (15, 25) (15, 12) (20, 8) (20, 23) (22, 5) (22, 24) (22, 25) (24, 26) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 19) (11, 0) (23, 7) (23, 20) (23, 19) (10, 1) (10, 16) (13, 17) (13, 27) (13, 24) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 5) (25, 28) (8, 7) (8, 20) (8, 28) (8, 29) (28, 2) (28, 25) (28, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 12) (19, 27) (19, 15) (19, 24) (19, 23) (5, 21) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 25) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 29) (9, 17) (9, 12) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 12) (29, 14) (29, 8) (29, 16) (12, 26) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:  
- <0, 21, 1, 10>  
- <0, 21, 5, 22>  
- <0, 21, 5, 25>  
- <0, 21, 1, 10, 16>  
- <0, 21, 1, 10, 16, 29>  
- <0, 21, 5, 25, 15>  
- <0, 21, 5, 25, 28, 2>
- <0, 21, 5, 22, 24, 26>  
- <0, 21, 1, 10, 16, 29, 14, 4>  
- <0, 21, 1, 10, 16, 29, 8>  
- <0, 21, 1, 10, 16, 29, 8, 20, 23>  
- <18, 6, 3, 2>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:  
- The only cycle with exactly one chord is <0, 21, 1, 10, 16>. The chord is (16, 10).  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:  
- We found 11 chordless cycles. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].  

Unique chordal 4-cycle:  
- <0, 21, 1, 10, 16>
