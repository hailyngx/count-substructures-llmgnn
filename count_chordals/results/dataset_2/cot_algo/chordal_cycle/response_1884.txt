Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 6) (1, 10) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (0, 8, 2, 3, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 8, 7, 2, 3, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 8, 5, 3, 2, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 8, 7, 5, 3, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 14, 7, 2, 3, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 14, 7, 5, 3, 0)
- Cycle 7: (2, 8, 7, 14, 0, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 8, 5, 3, 2)
- Cycle 9: (3, 2, 8, 0, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 2, 7, 0, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 2, 8, 5, 3)
- Cycle 12: (5, 8, 0, 3, 5)
- Cycle 13: (5, 8, 7, 0, 5)
- Cycle 14: (7, 8, 0, 3, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord (2, 3) forming a chordal 4-cycle <2, (2, 3), 0, 8>.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (2, 3) forming a chordal 4-cycle <3, (2, 3), 0, 7>.
- Cycle 3 has a chord (3, 5) forming a chordal 4-cycle <5, (3, 5), 0, 8>.
- Cycle 4 has a chord (5, 7) forming a chordal 4-cycle <7, (5, 7), 0, 8>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.
- There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.

Final answer: [4]
