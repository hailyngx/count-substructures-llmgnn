Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 5) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 15) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 17) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 7) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (14, 3) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 19) (17, 15) (17, 9) (17, 3) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles with length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 11 - 10 - 5 - 13 - 11
- Cycle 2: 11 - 15 - 18 - 4 - 11
- Cycle 3: 10 - 11 - 15 - 18 - 10
- Cycle 4: 10 - 7 - 9 - 2 - 10
- Cycle 5: 2 - 16 - 6 - 1 - 2
- Cycle 6: 2 - 9 - 8 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 7: 18 - 4 - 0 - 13 - 18
- Cycle 8: 18 - 15 - 17 - 9 - 18
- Cycle 9: 4 - 19 - 3 - 14 - 4
- Cycle 10: 5 - 13 - 0 - 4 - 5

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 10 - 13
- Cycle 2 has a chord 15 - 4
- Cycle 3 has a chord 11 - 18
- Cycle 4 has a chord 10 - 9
- Cycle 5 has a chord 16 - 1
- Cycle 6 has a chord 9 - 6
- Cycle 7 has a chord 4 - 13
- Cycle 8 has a chord 15 - 9
- Cycle 9 has a chord 19 - 3
- Cycle 10 has a chord 13 - 4

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found.

Thus, the final answer is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<11, (10, 13), 5)>
<11, (15, 4), 18)>
<10, (11, 18), 15)>
<10, (7, 9), 2)>
<2, (16, 1), 6)>
<2, (9, 6), 8)>
<18, (4, 13), 0)>
<18, (15, 9), 17)>
<4, (19, 3), 14)>
<5, (13, 4), 0)>
