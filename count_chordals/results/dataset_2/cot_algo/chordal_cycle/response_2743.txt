Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <9, (26, 28), 4, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <9, (26, 2), 25, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, (29, 4), 22, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (18, 8), 11, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <26, (28, 4), 22, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <26, (2, 25), 14, 20>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <26, (15, 18), 27, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, (24, 22), 7, 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <6, (3, 2), 25, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <6, (16, 24), 22, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <3, (2, 25), 13, 27>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <25, (2, 26), 15, 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <4, (10, 14), 20, 23>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <17, (7, 8), 18, 27>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <8, (11, 5), 27, 23>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <11, (5, 27), 13, 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <12, (17, 7), 22, 24>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <20, (14, 25), 2, 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <29, (4, 10), 14, 25>
