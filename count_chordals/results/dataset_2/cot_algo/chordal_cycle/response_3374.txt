Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-6-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-4-8-7-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-4-6-5
- Cycle 4: 5-0-3-7-5
- Cycle 5: 5-1-2-4-5
- Cycle 6: 9-0-3-7-9
- Cycle 7: 6-1-2-4-6
- Cycle 8: 4-9-0-3-4
- Cycle 9: 3-0-2-1-3

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has <1, 4> as a chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chords.
- Cycle 7 has <1, 2> as a chord.
- Cycle 8 has no chords.
- Cycle 9 has <0, 1> as a chord.

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <0, 1, 3>
