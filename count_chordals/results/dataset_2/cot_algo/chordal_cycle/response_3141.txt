Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (15, 2) (15, 11) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 13) (17, 10) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 9) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 12) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 5) (19, 10) (19, 7) (19, 13) (2, 15) (2, 16) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 19) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 9) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 1) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 13) (5, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the given graph with length 4 or more. We will list them all:
1. (3, 7, 17, 10)
2. (3, 6, 13, 19)
3. (4, 8, 12, 18)
4. (7, 17, 10, 19)
5. (14, 11, 10, 17)
6. (16, 10, 17, 7)
7. (16, 14, 0, 12)
8. (16, 2, 15, 11)
9. (0, 14, 11, 10)
10. (9, 4, 8, 7)
11. (1, 0, 14, 11)
12. (1, 9, 4, 8)
13. (13, 11, 14, 0)

Step 2:
Now, we will check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle (9, 4, 8, 7) has one chord 4-7

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<9, (4, 7), 8>
