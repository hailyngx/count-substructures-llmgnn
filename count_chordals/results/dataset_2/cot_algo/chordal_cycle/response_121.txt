Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 8-13-4-5-8
- Cycle 2: 8-0-11-5-8
- Cycle 3: 8-6-3-9-8
- Cycle 4: 2-1-5-12-2
- Cycle 5: 10-0-12-2-10

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <1, (13, 4)> is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2 <2, (0, 11)> is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 <3, (6, 9)> is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 4 <4, (1, 5)> is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 5 <5, (0, 12)> is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (13, 4)>
<2, (0, 11)>
<3, (6, 9)>
