Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 11) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 1-6-9-13-1
- Cycle 2: 3-7-12-8-3
- Cycle 3: 1-6-10-9-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-10-13-1  
- Cycle 5: 1-13-11-2-14-1  
- Cycle 6: 4-5-8-0-1-6-9-13-4  
- Cycle 7: 4-5-8-13-1-6-9-13-4  
- Cycle 8: 4-5-1-13-9-6-10-4  
- Cycle 9: 4-14-13-9-6-1-0-4  
- Cycle 10: 4-14-13-11-2-5-1-0-4  
- Cycle 11: 7-12-8-13-11-7  
- Cycle 12: 7-12-3-0-1-6-9-13-7  
- Cycle 13: 7-12-3-5-1-6-9-13-7  
- Cycle 14: 8-0-1-13-9-6-10-8  
- Cycle 15: 8-0-3-5-1-6-9-13-8  
- Cycle 16: 8-5-1-6-9-13-8

Step 2:

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 3: <1, (6, 10), 9>
- Cycle 4: <1, (6, 10), 13>
- Cycle 8: <4, (5, 1), 13>
- Cycle 9: <4, (14, 13), 9>
- Cycle 10: <4, (14, 13), 1>
- Cycle 12: <7, (12, 3), 8>
- Cycle 15: <8, (3, 5), 1>

Step 3:

The number of chordless cycles found is [1]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
