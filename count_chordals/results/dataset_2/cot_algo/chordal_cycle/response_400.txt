Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 5-2-8-0-5
        - Cycle 2: 6-1-9-7-6
        - Cycle 3: 0-5-7-9-0
        - Cycle 4: 1-6-4-2-1
        - Cycle 5: 3-9-1-4-3
        
Step 2: Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord (2, 8)
        - Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 9)
        - Cycle 3 has a chord (5, 7)
        - Cycle 4 has a chord (6, 4)
        - Cycle 5 has a chord (9, 1)
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
