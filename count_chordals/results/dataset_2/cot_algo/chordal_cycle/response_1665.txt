Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle with nodes: 5 - 1 - 9 - 4 - 5
2. Cycle with nodes: 5 - 0 - 8 - 3 - 5
3. Cycle with nodes: 5 - 7 - 6 - 3 - 5
4. Cycle with nodes: 9 - 8 - 2 - 6 - 9
5. Cycle with nodes: 4 - 8 - 2 - 1 - 4
6. Cycle with nodes: 4 - 9 - 1 - 2 - 4
7. Cycle with nodes: 8 - 0 - 6 - 2 - 8
8. Cycle with nodes: 3 - 6 - 2 - 7 - 3
9. Cycle with nodes: 6 - 7 - 2 - 1 - 6
10. Cycle with nodes: 0 - 1 - 2 - 7 - 0

Next, let's check each of these cycles for exactly one chord:

- Cycles with one chord:
1. <5, (1, 9), 4, 5>
2. <5, (0, 8), 3, 5>
3. <5, (7, 6), 3, 5>
4. <9, (8, 2), 6, 9>
5. <4, (8, 2), 1, 4>
6. <4, (9, 1), 2, 4>
7. <8, (0, 6), 2, 8>
8. <3, (6, 2), 7, 3>
9. <6, (7, 2), 1, 6>
10. <0, (1, 7), 2, 0>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
