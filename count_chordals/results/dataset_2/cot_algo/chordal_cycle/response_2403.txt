Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 4) (4, 0) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1:

Cycles of length 4 or more are:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 13, 5>
2. Cycle <5, 13, 10, 14, 5>
3. Cycle <9, 13, 10, 14, 9>
4. Cycle <9, 0, 13, 10, 9>
5. Cycle <9, 0, 12, 14, 9>
6. Cycle <10, 13, 0, 9, 10>
7. Cycle <10, 14, 12, 1, 10>
8. Cycle <13, 10, 14, 12, 13>
9. Cycle <13, 0, 12, 14, 13>
10. Cycle <0, 13, 4, 12, 0>
11. Cycle <12, 14, 10, 13, 12>
12. Cycle <12, 0, 13, 4, 12>
13. Cycle <14, 10, 13, 0, 14>
14. Cycle <14, 12, 0, 9, 14>

Step 2:

Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
1. <9, (5, 13), 10, 14, 9>
2. <9, (0, 12), 14, 10, 9>
3. <10, (13, 0), 9, 14, 10>
4. <13, (12, 0), 14, 10, 13>
5. <12, (0, 13), 14, 10, 12>

Step 3:

The number of chordless cycles found is [9].
