Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (4, 8) (4, 17) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 13) (5, 17) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 11) (17, 4) (17, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 1) (18, 7) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 13) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 0) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 12) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (13, 7) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 0, 8)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 11, 14)
- Cycle 3: (3, 10, 8, 0)
- Cycle 4: (15, 11, 14, 5)
- Cycle 5: (4, 8, 10, 1)
- Cycle 6: (7, 19, 0, 8)
- Cycle 7: (7, 19, 18, 1)
- Cycle 8: (7, 18, 13, 7)
- Cycle 9: (4, 17, 5, 14)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord (0, 8) <1, (0, 8), 1)>
- Cycle 2 has chord (11, 14) <2, (11, 14), 2)>
- Cycle 3 has chord (8, 10) <3, (8, 10), 3)>
- Cycle 4 has chord (11, 14) <4, (11, 14), 4)>
- Cycle 5 has chord (8, 10) <5, (8, 10), 5)>
- Cycle 6 has chord (8, 0) <6, (8, 0), 6)>
- Cycle 7 has chord (1, 18) <7, (1, 18), 7)>
- Cycle 8 has chord (5, 14) <8, (5, 14), 8)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, (3, 15), 2)>
