Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 8, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 9, 2, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 3, 0, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 3, 2, 9, 0, 7)
- Cycle 5: (2, 0, 9, 7, 4, 2)
- Cycle 6: (0, 3, 4, 2, 9, 0)
- Cycle 7: (3, 7, 4, 2, 0, 3)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (7, 2)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (0, 9)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (7, 2)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (7, 4)
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
