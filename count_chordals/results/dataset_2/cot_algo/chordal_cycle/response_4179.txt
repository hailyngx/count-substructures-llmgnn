Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 11) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 4) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 17) (16, 4) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 13) (6, 1) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (18, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 17) (9, 15) (9, 10) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 9) (17, 8) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges are:
1. Cycle: 8 - 13 - 1 - 0 - 8
2. Cycle: 13 - 6 - 1 - 10 - 13
3. Cycle: 7 - 14 - 0 - 13 - 7
4. Cycle: 12 - 17 - 2 - 4 - 12
5. Cycle: 5 - 4 - 16 - 15 - 5
6. Cycle: 19 - 17 - 15 - 4 - 19
7. Cycle: 8 - 14 - 7 - 5 - 8

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes) is:
1. Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (13, 1), 0, 7>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [6].
