Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (1, 4, 7, 3)
2. (1, 4, 8, 7)
3. (1, 4, 2, 5)
4. (1, 7, 5, 0)
5. (1, 7, 8, 4)
6. (1, 3, 7, 5)
7. (2, 4, 1, 7)
8. (2, 4, 8, 5)
9. (2, 1, 7, 0)
10. (5, 2, 4, 8)
11. (5, 7, 1, 3)
12. (5, 7, 8, 4)
13. (5, 6, 3, 7)
14. (5, 0, 1, 7)
15. (5, 0, 3, 7)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (4, 2), 5>
- <1, (7, 8), 4>
- <5, (7, 1), 3>

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
