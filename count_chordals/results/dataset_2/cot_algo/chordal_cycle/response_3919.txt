Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 9) (16, 21) (16, 29) (16, 18) (28, 4) (28, 18) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 4) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 25) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 7) (13, 6) (20, 29) (20, 24) (29, 16) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 0) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 14) (23, 3) (23, 21) (2, 6) (2, 24) (22, 6) (22, 25) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 24) (25, 1) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 4) (25, 18) (26, 10) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 27) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 14) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (7, 13) (14, 23) (14, 15) (12, 1) (12, 6) (0, 29) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 18) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 3) (27, 10) (18, 16) (18, 28) (18, 25) (18, 10) (18, 0) (4, 28) (4, 1) (4, 23) (4, 25) (24, 20) (24, 2) (24, 21) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 3) (3, 23) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 1 -> 17 -> 13 -> 21 -> 1
- Cycle 2: 1 -> 29 -> 20 -> 24 -> 21 -> 1
- Cycle 3: 1 -> 25 -> 22 -> 6 -> 12 -> 1
- Cycle 4: 1 -> 4 -> 28 -> 18 -> 1
- Cycle 5: 1 -> 4 -> 25 -> 22 -> 6 -> 1
- Cycle 6: 1 -> 4 -> 25 -> 18 -> 1
- Cycle 7: 1 -> 4 -> 23 -> 21 -> 24 -> 1
- Cycle 8: 1 -> 12 -> 6 -> 13 -> 21 -> 1
- Cycle 9: 1 -> 12 -> 6 -> 22 -> 25 -> 1
- Cycle 10: 1 -> 25 -> 18 -> 10 -> 27 -> 1
- Cycle 11: 1 -> 25 -> 18 -> 0 -> 29 -> 1
- Cycle 12: 9 -> 11 -> 23 -> 3 -> 9
- Cycle 13: 9 -> 19 -> 15 -> 14 -> 23 -> 9
- Cycle 14: 9 -> 0 -> 29 -> 20 -> 24 -> 9
- Cycle 15: 9 -> 0 -> 18 -> 16 -> 21 -> 9
- Cycle 16: 9 -> 3 -> 23 -> 14 -> 15 -> 9
- Cycle 17: 18 -> 28 -> 4 -> 25 -> 18
- Cycle 18: 18 -> 25 -> 1 -> 12 -> 6 -> 18
- Cycle 19: 18 -> 0 -> 29 -> 20 -> 24 -> 18
- Cycle 20: 18 -> 10 -> 26 -> 27 -> 18
- Cycle 21: 23 -> 4 -> 25 -> 22 -> 6 -> 23
- Cycle 22: 23 -> 21 -> 13 -> 7 -> 23

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <1, 29, 20, 24, 21>: (1, 29) is the chord.
- <1, 4, 28, 18>: (1, 4) is the chord.
- <1, 25, 22, 6, 12>: (1, 25) is the chord.
- <9, 11, 23, 3>: (9, 11) is the chord.
- <18, 0, 29, 20, 24>: (18, 0) is the chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 17 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [17].
