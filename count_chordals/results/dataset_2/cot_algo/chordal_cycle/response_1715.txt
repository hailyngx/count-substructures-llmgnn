Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 8) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 5, 14, 9, 6, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 5, 14, 9, 13, 5)
- Cycle 3: (0, 3, 12, 8, 6, 9, 10, 4)
- Cycle 4: (0, 2, 3, 12, 10, 4, 11, 2)
- Cycle 5: (0, 2, 11, 8, 6, 9, 13, 5)
- Cycle 6: (1, 5, 8, 6, 9, 13, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 3, 12, 10, 4, 11, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 has a chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (3, 12)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (8, 9)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (3, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles with only one chord found.

Therefore, the answer is [7].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (9, 13), 2, 5, 14>
- <3, (6, 8), 12, 10, 4>
- <0, (3, 12), 8, 11, 2>
- <1, (8, 9), 13, 5>
- <5, (5, 8), 6, 9, 13>
- <2, (3, 10), 11, 4>
- <0, (9, 13), 5, 14>
