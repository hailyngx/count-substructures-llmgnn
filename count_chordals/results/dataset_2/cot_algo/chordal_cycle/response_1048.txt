Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 3: (0, 8, 1, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 8, 1, 0, 9, 2, 3, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 9, 2, 7, 6, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 9, 2, 7, 6, 4, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 9, 2, 6, 0)
- Cycle 8: (0, 9, 2, 6, 4, 0)
- Cycle 9: (0, 1, 8, 5, 9, 0)
- Cycle 10: (0, 3, 2, 9, 0)
- Cycle 11: (0, 3, 2, 9, 5, 8, 0)
- Cycle 12: (0, 4, 7, 6, 0)
- Cycle 13: (0, 4, 6, 2, 9, 0)
- Cycle 14: (0, 4, 7, 6, 2, 9, 0)
- Cycle 15: (0, 4, 7, 9, 5, 8, 0)
- Cycle 16: (0, 6, 2, 3, 0)
- Cycle 17: (0, 6, 4, 7, 9, 0)
- Cycle 18: (0, 6, 4, 7, 9, 5, 8, 0)
- Cycle 19: (0, 6, 7, 4, 2, 9, 0)
- Cycle 20: (0, 6, 7, 9, 5, 8, 0)
- Cycle 21: (0, 6, 9, 5, 8, 0)
- Cycle 22: (1, 8, 5, 9, 0, 1)
- Cycle 23: (2, 4, 7, 6, 0)
- Cycle 24: (2, 6, 7, 4, 0)
- Cycle 25: (2, 6, 7, 9, 0, 2)
- Cycle 26: (2, 6, 4, 0, 2)
- Cycle 27: (2, 7, 4, 0, 2)
- Cycle 28: (3, 0, 1, 8, 5, 9, 3)
- Cycle 29: (3, 0, 8, 5, 9, 2, 3)
- Cycle 30: (4, 6, 7, 9, 0, 4)
- Cycle 31: (4, 6, 7, 9, 5, 8, 4)
- Cycle 32: (4, 7, 9, 5, 8, 4)
- Cycle 33: (6, 7, 4, 0, 6)
- Cycle 34: (6, 7, 4, 0, 2, 9, 6)
- Cycle 35: (6, 7, 9, 0, 6)
- Cycle 36: (7, 4, 0, 6, 7)
- Cycle 37: (7, 4, 0, 2, 9, 7)
- Cycle 38: (8, 5, 9, 0, 8)
- Cycle 39: (8, 5, 9, 2, 3, 8)
- Cycle 40: (9, 2, 7, 6, 4, 0, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Only Cycle 25: (2, 6, 7, 4, 0, 2) has exactly one chord: (6, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <25, (6, 4)>.
