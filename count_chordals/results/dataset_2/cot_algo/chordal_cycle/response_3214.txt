Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (15, 6). Adding it to the list of chordal 4-cycles: <1, (15, 6), 28>
- Cycle 2 has one chord (15, 20). Adding it to the list of chordal 4-cycles: <1, (15, 20), 28>
- Cycle 4 has one chord (16, 21). Adding it to the list of chordal 4-cycles: <1, (16, 21), 10>
- Cycle 6 has one chord (1, 29). Adding it to the list of chordal 4-cycles: <1, (1, 29), 22>
- Cycle 13 has one chord (12, 26). Adding it to the list of chordal 4-cycles: <12, (12, 26), 5>
- Cycle 15 has one chord (7, 8). Adding it to the list of chordal 4-cycles: <7, (7, 8), 4>
- Cycle 17 has one chord (27, 24). Adding it to the list of chordal 4-cycles: <27, (27, 24), 25>
- Cycle 18 has one chord (2, 5). Adding it to the list of chordal 4-cycles: <2, (2, 5), 7>
- Cycle 20 has one chord (7, 25). Adding it to the list of chordal 4-cycles: <7, (7, 25), 4>
- Cycle 25 has one chord (11, 14). Adding it to the list of chordal 4-cycles: <11, (11, 14), 23>
- Cycle 27 has one chord (12, 24). Adding it to the list of chordal 4-cycles: <12, (12, 24), 27>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [11].
