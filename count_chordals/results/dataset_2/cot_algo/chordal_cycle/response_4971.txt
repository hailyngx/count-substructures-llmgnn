Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of all cycles of length 4 or more: 
- {5, 9, 3, 1}, with edges (5, 9), (9, 3), (3, 1), (1, 5)
- {5, 9, 1, 4}, with edges (5, 9), (9, 1), (1, 4), (4, 5)
- {5, 9, 3, 4}, with edges (5, 9), (9, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)
- {5, 3, 4, 8}, with edges (5, 3), (3, 4), (4, 8), (8, 5)
- {5, 4, 8, 6}, with edges (5, 4), (4, 8), (8, 6), (6, 5)
- {5, 8, 6, 7}, with edges (5, 8), (8, 6), (6, 7), (7, 5)
- {9, 1, 2, 8}, with edges (9, 1), (1, 2), (2, 8), (8, 9)
- {4, 1, 2, 8}, with edges (4, 1), (1, 2), (2, 8), (8, 4)
- {4, 8, 2, 6}, with edges (4, 8), (8, 2), (2, 6), (6, 4)
- {3, 4, 8, 2}, with edges (3, 4), (4, 8), (8, 2), (2, 3)
- {8, 6, 7, 0}, with edges (8, 6), (6, 7), (7, 0), (0, 8)
- {4, 6, 7, 0}, with edges (4, 6), (6, 7), (7, 0), (0, 4)
- {3, 8, 7, 0}, with edges (3, 8), (8, 7), (7, 0), (0, 3)
- {5, 7, 6, 8}, with edges (5, 7), (7, 6), (6, 8), (8, 5)

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal cycle <5, 9, 3, 1> with the chord (9, 1)
- Chordal cycle <4, 1, 2, 8> with the chord (1, 8)
- Chordal cycle <8, 6, 7, 0> with the chord (6, 7)

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found = [11]
