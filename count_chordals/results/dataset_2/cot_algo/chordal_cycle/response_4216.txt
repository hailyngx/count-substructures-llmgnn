Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (4, 15) (4, 9) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 0) (10, 18) (8, 14) (8, 17) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 6) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 5) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 19) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 16) (11, 18) (11, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1: (3, 15, 4, 9, 7, 3)
2. Cycle 2: (3, 13, 14, 17, 16, 1, 12, 3)
3. Cycle 3: (15, 19, 9, 4, 15)
4. Cycle 4: (14, 8, 17, 16, 1, 7, 9, 19, 15, 14)
5. Cycle 5: (14, 13, 2, 18, 10, 0, 6, 2)
6. Cycle 6: (17, 8, 14, 13, 5, 14, 17)
7. Cycle 7: (8, 17, 16, 12, 11, 18, 2, 13, 3, 12)
8. Cycle 8: (2, 6, 0, 10, 18, 11, 12, 1, 7, 1)
9. Cycle 9: (18, 6, 0, 1, 12, 16, 17, 14, 5, 13)
10. Cycle 10: (16, 1, 12, 11, 18, 6, 2, 13, 5, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<3, 15, 4, 9, 7>: (15, 9) is a chord
<14, 8, 17, 16, 1, 12, 3>: (8, 16) is a chord
<14, 13, 2, 18, 10, 0, 6>: (13, 18) is a chord
<17, 8, 14, 13, 5, 14>: (8, 13) is a chord
<8, 17, 16, 12, 11, 18, 2, 13, 3, 12>: (12, 3) is a chord
<2, 6, 0, 10, 18, 11, 12, 1, 7, 1>: (11, 1) is a chord
<18, 6, 0, 1, 12, 16, 17, 14, 5, 13>: (6, 1) is a chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 3 chordless cycles in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
