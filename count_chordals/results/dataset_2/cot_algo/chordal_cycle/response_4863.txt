Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 18) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 2) (17, 11) (17, 0) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 14) (0, 15) (0, 17) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 3) (3, 6) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 4) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: {11, 16, 13, 8, 11}
- Cycle 2: {11, 5, 7, 8, 11}
- Cycle 3: {9, 14, 19, 2, 9}
- Cycle 4: {1, 15, 7, 8, 1}
- Cycle 5: {1, 4, 2, 15, 1}

Step 2: Checking for chords:
- <1, (4, 15)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (4, 15)> inside <>.
