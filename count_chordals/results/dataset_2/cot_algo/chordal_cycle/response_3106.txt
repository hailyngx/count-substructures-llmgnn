Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 12) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 4) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 4) (16, 14) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 4) (9, 10) (18, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 18) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 19) (4, 16) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (3, 8) (3, 16) (3, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 16, 14, 1, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 12, 15, 1>
- Cycle 4: <4, 0, 16, 3, 4>
- Cycle 5: <8, 14, 17, 12, 8>
- Cycle 6: <12, 17, 14, 16, 12>

Step 2:
- Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
  - Cycle 1: <0, 5, 6, 1, 0> has a chord (6, 1)
  - Cycle 2: <0, 16, 14, 1, 0> has a chord (16, 14)
  - Cycle 3: <1, 6, 12, 15, 1> has a chord (6, 15)
  - Cycle 4: <4, 0, 16, 3, 4> has a chord (0, 16)
  - Cycle 5: <8, 14, 17, 12, 8> has a chord (14, 12)
  - Cycle 6: <12, 17, 14, 16, 12> has a chord (17, 16)

Step 3:
- Count of chordal 4-cycles: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles: <0, 5, 6, 1, (6, 1)>, <0, 16, 14, 1, (16, 14)>, <1, 6, 12, 15, (6, 15)>, <4, 0, 16, 3, (0, 16)>, <8, 14, 17, 12, (14, 12)>, <12, 17, 14, 16, (17, 16)>
