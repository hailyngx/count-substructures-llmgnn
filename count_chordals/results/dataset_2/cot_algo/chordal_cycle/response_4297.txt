Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (2, 11, 10, 6)
- Cycle 2: (2, 11, 1, 6)
- Cycle 3: (2, 1, 6, 10)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 4, 14)
- Cycle 5: (5, 3, 7, 13)
- Cycle 6: (0, 3, 5, 14)
- Cycle 7: (0, 3, 7, 13)
- Cycle 8: (0, 2, 1, 11)
- Cycle 9: (0, 2, 5, 14)
- Cycle 10: (0, 2, 1, 6)
- Cycle 11: (1, 6, 10, 14)
- Cycle 12: (1, 6, 7, 13)
- Cycle 13: (1, 12, 10, 14)
- Cycle 14: (1, 12, 8, 2)
- Cycle 15: (1, 12, 13, 9)
- Cycle 16: (10, 12, 8, 2)
- Cycle 17: (10, 12, 13, 9)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (6, 10), 11>
- <1, (6, 7), 12>
- <2, (10, 14), 11>
- <2, (6, 7), 1>
- <2, (1, 12), 6>
- <10, (8, 2), 12>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [11]
