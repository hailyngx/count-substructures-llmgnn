- Cycle 25: (14, 7, 4, 14)
- Cycle 26: (14, 1, 3, 14)
- Cycle 27: (14, 6, 0, 14)
- Cycle 28: (6, 0, 13, 6)
- Cycle 29: (10, 7, 4, 10)
- Cycle 30: (10, 12, 5, 10)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in the cycles:
- The cycles with exactly one chord are:
    * <1, (11, 13), 4, 1>
    * <3, (1, 2), 4, 3>
    * <5, (7, 4), 7, 5>
    * <11, (0, 6), 13, 11>
    * <14, (6, 0), 4, 14>
    
Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are [5] chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
