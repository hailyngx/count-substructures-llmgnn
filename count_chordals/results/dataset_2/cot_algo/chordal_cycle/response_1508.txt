Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 13) (1, 2) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 16) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 4) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 13) (16, 7) (11, 2) (11, 1) (14, 18) (14, 13) (3, 6) (3, 19) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 6) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 19) 

Response:
Step 1:  
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph, but not all of them have all edges given. We list the cycles with all edges present:
- Cycle 1: (1, 2, 11, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 2, 17, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 17, 18, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 11, 1, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 17, 18, 2)
- Cycle 6: (7, 9, 12, 7)
- Cycle 7: (8, 1, 11, 8)
- Cycle 8: (8, 1, 17, 8)
- Cycle 9: (8, 6, 4, 8)
- Cycle 10: (10, 4, 0, 10)
- Cycle 11: (10, 5, 15, 10)
- Cycle 12: (12, 6, 8, 12)
- Cycle 13: (12, 9, 7, 12)
- Cycle 14: (12, 18, 17, 12)
- Cycle 15: (12, 19, 3, 12)
- Cycle 16: (13, 14, 18, 13)
- Cycle 17: (13, 15, 8, 13)
- Cycle 18: (14, 13, 15, 14)
- Cycle 19: (15, 5, 10, 15)
- Cycle 20: (16, 7, 9, 16)

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, only Cycle 5: (2, 17, 18, 2) has exactly one chord (1-2-3-4-1). All other cycles either have no chords or more than one chord.

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<2, (17, 18), 1>
