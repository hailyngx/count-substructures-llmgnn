Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (2, 10) (2, 13) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 16) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 19) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 19) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 9) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 1) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (1, 19) (1, 12) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 18) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle: 0-3-17-16-13-2-10-6-7-9-4-8-12-1-19-14
2. Cycle: 0-3-17-16-13-2-10-6-7-9-4-8-18-5-15
3. Cycle: 0-9-7-6-12-1-19-14-11-10-2-13-16-17-3-15
4. Cycle: 0-9-7-14-11-13-2-10-6-12-1-19-16-17-3-15
5. Cycle: 0-8-4-9-7-14-11-13-2-10-6-12-1-19-16-17
6. Cycle: 0-8-4-9-7-6-12-1-19-16-13-2-10
7. Cycle: 3-17-16-13-2-10-6-7-9-4-8-12-1-19-14-11
8. Cycle: 3-17-16-13-11-14-7-9-0-8-12-1-19-10-2-5
9. Cycle: 3-17-16-13-11-14-7-6-12-1-19-10-2-5-8-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- The cycle 0-3-17-16-13-2-10-6-7-9-4-8-12-1-19-14 contains one chord: (10, 4)
- The cycle 0-3-17-16-13-2-10-6-7-9-4-8-18-5-15 contains one chord: (18, 10)
- The cycle 0-9-7-6-12-1-19-14-11-10-2-13-16-17-3-15 contains one chord: (14, 12)
- The cycle 0-9-7-14-11-13-2-10-6-12-1-19-16-17-3-15 contains one chord: (2, 1)
- The cycle 0-8-4-9-7-14-11-13-2-10-6-12-1-19-16-17 contains one chord: (12, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 3, 17, 16> with chord (10, 4)
<0, 3, 17, 16> with chord (18, 10)
<0, 9, 7, 6> with chord (14, 12)
<0, 9, 7, 14> with chord (2, 1)
<0, 8, 4, 9> with chord (12, 16)
