Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 0) (6, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 6, 0, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 12, 7, 10, 8, 14, 9, 12)
- Cycle 3: (7, 3, 11, 6, 5, 13, 2, 9, 7)
- Cycle 4: (10, 1, 5, 13, 3, 8, 10)
- Cycle 5: (12, 13, 5, 6, 11, 3, 9, 2, 12)
- Cycle 6: (14, 8, 10, 1, 0, 6, 13, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- From Cycle 1: Chord <4, 6>
- From Cycle 2: Chord <7, 8>
- From Cycle 3: Chord <7, 11>
- From Cycle 4: Chord <1, 13>
- From Cycle 5: No chord found
- From Cycle 6: Chord <14, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, 6, 0, 5> inside <>.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
