Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 9) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 14, 13, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 3, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 3, 11, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 1, 11, 3, 5, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 6, 12, 7, 10, 3, 5, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 13, 6, 12, 7, 14, 13>
- Cycle 8: <1, 6, 12, 0, 5, 3, 11, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 6, 13, 0, 4, 14, 13>
- Cycle 10: <1, 9, 11, 3, 10, 7, 12, 0>
- Cycle 11: <2, 3, 5, 0, 13, 6, 1, 11, 2>
- Cycle 12: <2, 7, 12, 0, 5, 3, 11, 1, 6, 2>
- Cycle 13: <3, 2, 10, 7, 12, 0, 5, 3>
- Cycle 14: <3, 10, 7, 2, 13, 6, 12, 3>
- Cycle 15: <7, 2, 10, 3, 11, 1, 6, 12, 7>
  
Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (a non-adjacent edge) are:
- <0, 4, 8, 2, 0> with chord (4, 14)
- <0, 5, 3, 2, 0> with chord (3, 5)
- <0, 6, 1, 11, 3, 5, 0> with chord (1, 6)
- <0, 13, 6, 12, 7, 14, 13> with chord (6, 14)
- <1, 6, 12, 0, 5, 3, 11, 1> with chord (6, 12)
- <2, 3, 5, 0, 13, 6, 1, 11, 2> with chord (3, 6)

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the total count is [6].
