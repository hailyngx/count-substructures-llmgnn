Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2:
- No chordal 4-cycles were found.

Step 3:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [0].
