Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 9, 4, 1, 5)
- (5, 9, 2, 3, 5)
- (5, 6, 1, 4, 5)
- (5, 2, 3, 1, 5)
- (5, 1, 6, 4, 5)
- (9, 4, 8, 3, 9)
- (9, 2, 3, 8, 9)
- (9, 7, 6, 5, 9)
- (1, 6, 7, 2, 1)
- (1, 3, 2, 5, 1)
- (4, 8, 3, 2, 4)
- (3, 8, 4, 1, 3)
- (8, 6, 7, 2, 8)
- (6, 7, 9, 5, 6)
- (2, 7, 6, 1, 2)
- (7, 2, 3, 8, 7)
- (7, 6, 4, 1, 7)
- (0, 5, 1, 6, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, (1, 4), 9>
- <5, (2, 3), 9>
- <5, (1, 4), 6>
- <5, (1, 4), 6>
- <1, (2, 7), 6>
- <4, (3, 8), 1>
- <6, (7, 2), 8>
- <6, (1, 4), 7>
- <0, (1, 6), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are a total of [9] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
