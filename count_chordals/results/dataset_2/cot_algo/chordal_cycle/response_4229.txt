Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8)

- Cycle 25: (6, 7, 3, 5, 6)
- Cycle 26: (6, 7, 0, 4, 6)
- Cycle 27: (6, 7, 9, 8, 6)
- Cycle 28: (6, 2, 5, 3, 6)
- Cycle 29: (6, 2, 9, 8, 6)
- Cycle 30: (3, 7, 0, 4, 3)
- Cycle 31: (3, 7, 9, 8, 3)
- Cycle 32: (3, 0, 4, 1, 3)
- Cycle 33: (3, 0, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle 34: (4, 0, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 35: (4, 0, 3, 5, 4)
- Cycle 36: (4, 0, 8, 5, 4)
- Cycle 37: (0, 6, 7, 3, 0)
- Cycle 38: (0, 6, 2, 5, 0)
- Cycle 39: (0, 3, 7, 9, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (5, 4), 9> (Cycle 1 has chord 5-4)
- <2, (5, 9), 4> (Cycle 2 has chord 5-9)
- <3, (6, 7), 5> (Cycle 3 has chord 6-7)
- <4, (9, 2), 6> (Cycle 4 has chord 9-2)
- <5, (9, 4), 2> (Cycle 5 has chord 9-4)
- <6, (8, 1), 4> (Cycle 6 has chord 8-1)
- <7, (7, 3), 6> (Cycle 7 has chord 7-3)
- <8, (5, 6), 9> (Cycle 8 has chord 5-6)
- <9, (6, 0), 7> (Cycle 9 has chord 6-0)
- <10, (3, 6), 2> (Cycle 10 has chord 3-6)
- <11, (7, 6), 3> (Cycle 11 has chord 7-6)
- <12, (9, 8), 6> (Cycle 12 has chord 9-8)
- <13, (5, 2), 3> (Cycle 15 has chord 5-2)
- <14, (8, 9), 3> (Cycle 21 has chord 8-9)
- <15, (1, 4), 9> (Cycle 22 has chord 1-4)
- <16, (1, 2), 9> (Cycle 23 has chord 1-2)
- <17, (7, 6), 3> (Cycle 25 has chord 7-6)
- <18, (4, 0), 6> (Cycle 26 has chord 4-0)
- <19, (9, 8), 6> (Cycle 27 has chord 9-8)
- <20, (3, 6), 7> (Cycle 28 has chord 3-6)
- <21, (5, 2), 9> (Cycle 29 has chord 5-2)
- <22, (4, 0), 7> (Cycle 30 has chord 4-0)
- <23, (9, 8), 3> (Cycle 31 has chord 9-8)
- <24, (4, 1), 3> (Cycle 32 has chord 4-1)
- <25, (3, 6), 4> (Cycle 34 has chord 3-6)
- <26, (5, 3), 4> (Cycle 35 has chord 5-3)
- <27, (8, 5), 4> (Cycle 36 has chord 8-5)
- <28, (6, 0), 3> (Cycle 38 has chord 6-0)
- <29, (7, 9), 4> (Cycle 39 has chord 7-9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 29 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
So, the final count is [29].
