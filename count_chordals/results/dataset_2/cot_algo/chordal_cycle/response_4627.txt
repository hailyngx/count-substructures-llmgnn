- Cycle 8: (9, 21, 28, 11)
- Cycle 9: (0, 14, 2, 22)
- Cycle 10: (0, 14, 29, 26)
- Cycle 11: (11, 6, 9, 23)
- Cycle 12: (11, 6, 8, 5)

- Cycle 21: (26, 23, 9, 21)
- Cycle 22: (26, 17, 12, 18)
- Cycle 23: (1, 15, 3, 7)
- Cycle 24: (2, 14, 0, 4)
- Cycle 25: (2, 14, 29, 26)
- Cycle 26: (2, 22, 19, 13)
- Cycle 27: (2, 22, 19, 27)
- Cycle 28: (4, 0, 14, 2)
- Cycle 29: (4, 0, 12, 5)
- Cycle 30: (4, 28, 11, 6)

Step 2:
From the cycles identified above, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (15, 25), 4>
- <2, (14, 29), 26>
- <6, (9, 23), 26>
- <6, (8, 5), 11>
- <9, (21, 28), 4>
- <11, (6, 8), 5>
- <11, (13, 19), 27>
- <14, (0, 2), 4>

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord is [8].
