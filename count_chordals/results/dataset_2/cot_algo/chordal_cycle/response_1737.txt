Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 1, 29, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 23, 0, 3, 11)
- Cycle 3: (11, 18, 26, 5, 11)
- Cycle 4: (11, 2, 7, 1, 11)
- Cycle 5: (16, 24, 29, 1, 16)
- Cycle 6: (16, 9, 17, 22, 16)
- Cycle 7: (16, 5, 26, 14, 16)
- Cycle 8: (15, 20, 7, 1, 15)
- Cycle 9: (15, 6, 18, 13, 15)
- Cycle 10: (20, 4, 13, 28, 20)
- Cycle 11: (4, 18, 26, 22, 4)
- Cycle 12: (18, 6, 15, 20, 18)
- Cycle 13: (18, 13, 25, 0, 18)

- Cycle 15: (22, 26, 14, 25, 22)
- Cycle 16: (1, 16, 1) (Not a valid cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 17: (3, 0, 25, 8) (Not a valid cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 18: (9, 16, 1, 29) (Not a valid cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 19: (23, 0, 25, 14) (Not a valid cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 20: (14, 26, 5, 16) (Not a valid cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 21: (5, 26, 14, 22) (Not a valid cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 22: (2, 7, 1, 29) (Not a valid cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 23: (12, 2, 7, 1) (Not a valid cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 24: (29, 24, 16, 11) (Not a valid cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 25: (13, 18, 11, 16) (Not a valid cycle of length 4)
  
Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (16, 5), 29, 24>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <16, (5, 26), 14, 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (7, 2), 12, 10>

Step 3:
- There are [3] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
