Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are two cycles of length 4 in this graph:
1. Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 5 - 1 - 4
2. Cycle 2: 4 - 6 - 1 - 5 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 5 - 1 - 4 has only one chord: (7, 1)
Cycle 2: 4 - 6 - 1 - 5 - 4 has only one chord: (6, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are <1, (7, 1)> and <2, (6, 5)>.
