Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 4) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 13) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1 - 6 - 9 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 6 - 11 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 11 - 12 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 4: 2 - 5 - 8 - 2
- Cycle 5: 3 - 7 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 6: 3 - 10 - 12 - 3
- Cycle 7: 4 - 9 - 13 - 4
- Cycle 8: 6 - 9 - 13 - 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has chord <6, 4>
- Cycle 2 has chord <6, 11>
- Cycle 3 has chord <11, 12>
- Cycle 4 has chord <5, 8>
- Cycle 5 has chord <7, 8>
- Cycle 6 has chord <10, 12>
- Cycle 7 has chord <9, 13>
- Cycle 8 has chord <9, 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles in this graph. Hence, the final count is [0].
