Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- One cycle of length 4: <6, 5, 10, 13, (9, 12)> 
- One cycle of length 4: <6, 7, 12, 14, (0, 3)> 
- One cycle of length 4: <4, 9, 13, 0, (14, 8)> 
- One cycle of length 4: <4, 8, 1, 2, (5, 3)>
- One cycle of length 4: <7, 12, 9, 13, (0, 5)>
- One cycle of length 4: <9, 4, 1, 11, (3, 13)>


Step 2:
- Checking each of the cycles listed above for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes).

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [0]
