Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 7 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 2 - 7 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 9 - 2 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 5: 5 - 4 - 1 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 6: 5 - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 7: 4 - 7 - 6 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 8: 4 - 7 - 2 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 9: 4 - 7 - 8 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 10: 4 - 0 - 3 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 11: 4 - 0 - 1 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 12: 6 - 1 - 9 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 13: 6 - 1 - 4 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 13: 6 - 7 - 4 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 14: 6 - 7 - 8 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 15: 7 - 4 - 0 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 16: 7 - 4 - 1 - 9 - 7
- Cycle 17: 7 - 4 - 2 - 5 - 7
- Cycle 18: 7 - 4 - 8 - 5 - 7
- Cycle 19: 8 - 7 - 4 - 1 - 8
- Cycle 20: 8 - 7 - 6 - 9 - 8

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 7 - 5 has one chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 7 - 8 - 5 has one chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 3: 4 - 7 - 6 - 9 - 4 has one chord (6, 9)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 9, (6, 8), 7, 5>
<5, 4, (4, 8), 8, 5>
<4, 7, (6, 9), 9, 4>
