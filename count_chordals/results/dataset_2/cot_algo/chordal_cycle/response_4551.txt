Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 12) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 15) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 6) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 5) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 12) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 5) (18, 1) (4, 3) (4, 11) (13, 9) (14, 10) (14, 15) (14, 19) (14, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 10-12-8-2-10
        - Cycle 2: 10-19-6-1-9-10
        - Cycle 3: 10-19-8-2-7-10
        - Cycle 4: 10-19-14-15-11-10
        - Cycle 5: 10-12-5-16-14-19-10
        - Cycle 6: 10-12-6-19-14-15-11-7-3-4-10
        - Cycle 7: 17-2-8-19-6-1-9-17
        - Cycle 8: 17-2-8-12-10-19-6-1-9-17
        - Cycle 9: 17-2-8-12-6-19-14-15-11-7-3-4-17
        - Cycle 10: 10-19-14-16-5-8-2-7-11-15-10
        - Cycle 11: 10-19-14-16-5-8-12-6-1-9-10
        - Cycle 12: 10-12-8-2-7-11-15-14-19-6-10

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 5 has a chord 16-14, making it not chordal
        - Cycle 6 has two chords 14-15 and 12-6, making it not chordal
        - Cycle 9 has two chords 8-12 and 14-15, making it not chordal
        - Cycle 10 has a chord 8-2, making it not chordal
        - Cycle 11 has a chord 8-2, making it not chordal
        - Cycle 12 has two chords 14-15 and 8-12, making it not chordal

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        <10, 19, 6, 1>
        <10, 19, 8, 2>
        <17, 2, 8, 19>
        <17, 2, 8, 12>
