Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <3, (8, 6), 25>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - As there is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle, the number of chordless cycles is [45].
