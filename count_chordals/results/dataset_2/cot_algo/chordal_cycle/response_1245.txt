Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (2, 9, 7, 4, 2)
- Cycle 2: (2, 9, 7, 3, 2)
- Cycle 3: (2, 9, 4, 7, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 9, 4, 0, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 9, 4, 14, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 9, 7, 3, 13, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 9, 7, 4, 0, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 9, 4, 7, 3, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 9, 4, 7, 2, 13, 3, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 9, 4, 7, 3, 13, 6, 1, 12, 2)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (7, 3)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (4, 0)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (4, 14)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (7, 13)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (4, 0)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 9 has multiple chords.
- Cycle 10 has multiple chords.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<2, 9, 7, 4, 2>
<2, 9, 7, 3, 2>
<2, 9, 4, 7, 2>
<2, 9, 4, 0, 2>
<2, 9, 4, 14, 2>
<2, 9, 7, 3, 13, 2>
<2, 9, 4, 7, 3, 2>
