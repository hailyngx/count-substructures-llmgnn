Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-7-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-7-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-7-13-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-7-13-14-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-7-12-1
- Cycle 6: 1-6-7-12-9-1
- Cycle 7: 1-6-7-12-0-1
- Cycle 8: 1-6-7-2-14-1
- Cycle 9: 1-6-7-13-14-2-1
- Cycle 10: 1-7-13-14-2-1
- Cycle 11: 1-7-12-9-1
- Cycle 12: 1-7-12-0-1
- Cycle 13: 1-7-2-14-1
- Cycle 14: 1-7-13-14-2-7
- Cycle 15: 1-7-12-0-3-1
- Cycle 16: 1-7-13-14-2-4-1
- Cycle 17: 1-7-2-4-1
- Cycle 18: 1-7-13-14-2-4-8-1
- Cycle 19: 4-8-13-14-2-7-4
- Cycle 20: 3-0-12-7-2-14-3
- Cycle 21: 3-12-7-2-4-11-3
- Cycle 22: 3-12-7-2-14-9-3
- Cycle 23: 0-12-7-2-4-11-0
- Cycle 24: 0-12-7-2-14-9-0
- Cycle 25: 5-3-9-14-5
- Cycle 26: 5-3-12-7-2-14-5
- Cycle 27: 4-2-7-12-3-4
- Cycle 28: 4-2-7-12-0-13-4
- Cycle 29: 4-2-14-9-12-4
- Cycle 30: 3-0-12-9-14-3
- Cycle 31: 3-0-13-7-12-3
- Cycle 32: 2-4-8-1-7-2
- Cycle 33: 2-4-1-6-7-2
- Cycle 34: 2-14-9-12-7-2
- Cycle 35: 2-14-5-3-12-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The unique chordal 4-cycle is:
- <1, 6, 7, 13, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is [1] chordal 4-cycle found.
