Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (19, 8) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (13, 14) (0, 17) (0, 10) (0, 6) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 9) (12, 1) (12, 5) (10, 1) (10, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 5) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 15) (15, 16) (15, 17) (15, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 6, 8, 3, 2, 11)
- Cycle 2: (17, 14, 13, 9, 7, 6, 16, 15, 17)
- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 15, 17, 0, 10, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 2, 9, 7, 6, 0, 10, 1, 3)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (6, 16)
- Cycle 2 has one chord (14, 17)
- Cycle 3 has one chord (4, 15)
- Cycle 4 has one chord (7, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (6, 16), 2, 11)>
<2, (14, 17), 13, 9)>
<3, (4, 15), 17, 0)>
<4, (7, 9), 3, 2)>
