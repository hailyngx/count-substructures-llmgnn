Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 18) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 15) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 15) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 3) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 2) (2, 19) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 10, 5, 0, 17, 15, 14, 11)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 18, 17, 15, 7, 12, 4, 6)
- Cycle 3: (8, 6, 13, 2, 5, 0, 14, 8)
- Cycle 4: (1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 13, 12, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has chord (10, 15)
- Cycle 2 has chord (9, 12)
- Cycle 3 has chord (6, 5)
- Cycle 4 has chord (4, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles: <1, (10, 15)>, <2, (9, 12)>, <3, (6, 5)>, <4, (4, 13)>
- Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
