Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 5) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 2, 7, 4, 6)  
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 1, 13, 5, 6)  
- Cycle 3: (6, 10, 11, 5, 13, 6)  
- Cycle 4: (6, 4, 7, 0, 13, 6)  
- Cycle 5: (6, 12, 10, 3, 9, 6)  

Step 2:  
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:  
- Cycle 1: Chord (9, 4)  
- Cycle 2: Chord (9, 13)  
- Cycle 3: Chord (10, 5)  
- Cycle 4: Chord (7, 0)  
- Cycle 5: Chord (10, 9)  

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:  
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found.  

Final answer: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:  
<1, (9, 4), 7, 2>  
<2, (9, 13), 1, 13>  
<3, (10, 5), 11, 5>  
<4, (7, 0), 4, 0>  
<5, (10, 9), 12, 10>
