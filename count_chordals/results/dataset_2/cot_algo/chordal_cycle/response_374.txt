Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 4) (22, 23) (22, 9) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 8) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 21) (27, 3) (27, 26) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 23) (7, 26) (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 26) (10, 11) (23, 22) (23, 7) (23, 19) (20, 1) (12, 7) (12, 9) (12, 28) (12, 29) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 17) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 25) (0, 6) (2, 24) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 1) (25, 26) (25, 24) (24, 16) (24, 2) (24, 25) (1, 11) (1, 20) (1, 25) (5, 3) (8, 15) (8, 29) (8, 21) (28, 12) (28, 0) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 18) (14, 6) (14, 3) (3, 27) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (19, 23) (19, 21) (21, 27) (21, 8) (21, 19) (21, 29) (29, 12) (29, 8) (29, 21) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 16) (26, 25) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<3, (5, 3), 6, 14>
<4, (9, 4), 17, 18>
<7, (23, 7), 12, 29>
<11, (16, 11), 24, 2>
<15, (27, 15), 8, 21>
<16, (26, 16), 25, 24>
<21, (27, 21), 29, 19>
<25, (26, 25), 1, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycles are:
<3, (5, 3), 6, 14>
<4, (9, 4), 17, 18>
<11, (16, 11), 24, 2>
<15, (27, 15), 8, 21>
<25, (26, 25), 1, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
