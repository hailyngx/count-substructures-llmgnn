Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-7-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-2-4-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-2-3-1
- Cycle 4: 1-5-8-3-1
- Cycle 5: 1-9-6-1
- Cycle 6: 1-9-7-4-1
- Cycle 7: 1-9-7-3-1
- Cycle 8: 1-9-7-0-1
- Cycle 9: 1-9-6-3-1
- Cycle 10: 1-7-4-3-1
- Cycle 11: 1-7-3-6-1
- Cycle 12: 1-7-3-2-1
- Cycle 13: 1-7-0-1
- Cycle 14: 1-6-9-7-1
- Cycle 15: 1-6-9-5-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle <1, (5, 2), 4>
- Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle <1, (9, 4), 7>
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle <1, (9, 0), 7>
- Cycle 9 is a chordal 4-cycle <1, (9, 6), 1>
- Cycle 10 is a chordal 4-cycle <1, (7, 4), 3>
- Cycle 11 is a chordal 4-cycle <1, (7, 6), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 15 cycles found, and 6 of them are chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 15 - 6 = 9.

So, the final result is [9].
