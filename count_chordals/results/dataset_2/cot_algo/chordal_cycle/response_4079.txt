Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 12) (17, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 5) (16, 8) (16, 5) (18, 11) (18, 15) (19, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 7) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 3) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 3) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 13) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 5) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 11 - 1 - 8 - 4 - 11
- Cycle 2: 13 - 12 - 1 - 11 - 13
- Cycle 3: 6 - 11 - 1 - 12 - 6
- Cycle 4: 7 - 13 - 12 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 5: 2 - 5 - 7 - 13 - 2
- Cycle 6: 3 - 4 - 9 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 11 - 1 - 8 - 4 - 11 has a chord 1 - 4
- Cycle 2: 13 - 12 - 1 - 11 - 13 has a chord 12 - 11
- Cycle 3: 6 - 11 - 1 - 12 - 6 has a chord 11 - 12
- Cycle 4: 7 - 13 - 12 - 1 - 7 has a chord 13 - 1
- Cycle 5: 2 - 5 - 7 - 13 - 2 has a chord 5 - 13
- Cycle 6: 3 - 4 - 9 - 3 has a chord 4 - 9

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
