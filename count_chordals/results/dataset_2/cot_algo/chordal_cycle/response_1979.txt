Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 19) (15, 2) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 13) (11, 17) (1, 5) (1, 8) (16, 0) (16, 19) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 19) (14, 2) (17, 0) (17, 11) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 7) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 16) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle: 3-11-15-2-3
2. Cycle: 3-11-13-7-6-9-3
3. Cycle: 3-11-13-7-5-4-9-3
4. Cycle: 3-11-17-0-16-19-3
5. Cycle: 15-11-13-7-5-2-15
6. Cycle: 15-11-17-0-2-5-15
7. Cycle: 6-9-4-13-7-6
8. Cycle: 6-9-4-5-7-6
9. Cycle: 6-9-4-18-10-7-6
10. Cycle: 6-9-19-16-0-17-11-6
11. Cycle: 6-9-19-12-2-15-11-6
12. Cycle: 9-4-13-7-5-2-15-9
13. Cycle: 9-4-13-7-10-18-8-9
14. Cycle: 9-4-5-7-13-11-15-9
15. Cycle: 9-4-5-2-0-17-11-15-9
16. Cycle: 9-19-16-0-2-5-7-13-9
17. Cycle: 9-19-12-2-5-7-13-9
18. Cycle: 4-13-7-6-9-18-4
19. Cycle: 4-13-7-10-18-8-4
20. Cycle: 4-13-11-15-2-5-4
21. Cycle: 4-13-11-17-0-16-19-4
22. Cycle: 4-5-7-6-9-18-4
23. Cycle: 4-5-7-10-18-8-4
24. Cycle: 4-5-2-0-17-11-13-4
25. Cycle: 18-10-7-5-2-15-11-18
26. Cycle: 18-10-7-13-11-15-2-18
27. Cycle: 18-8-6-9-4-13-11-18
28. Cycle: 18-8-1-5-2-15-11-18
29. Cycle: 5-7-13-4-18-10-5
30. Cycle: 5-2-15-11-13-7-5
31. Cycle: 13-7-6-9-4-5-13
32. Cycle: 13-7-5-2-15-11-13

Next, we need to check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle) and count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

1. Chordal 4-cycles: 
- <3, 15, 11, 5>
- <6, 9, 4, 13>
- <7, 13, 11, 17>
- <16, 0, 17, 11>
- <17, 0, 2, 12>
- <2, 5, 7, 13> 

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [26].
