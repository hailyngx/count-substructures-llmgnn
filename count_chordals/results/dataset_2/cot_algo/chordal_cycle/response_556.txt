This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 19) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 12) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 11) (18, 12) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 0) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 15) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 15) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 6) (1, 8) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 3) (13, 6) (13, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 2-6-3-4-2
        - Cycle 2: 2-6-13-15-2
        - Cycle 3: 2-14-3-7-2
        - Cycle 4: 2-14-15-12-2
        - Cycle 5: 2-14-1-8-2
        - Cycle 6: 2-0-8-1-2
        - Cycle 7: 2-0-10-15-2
        - Cycle 8: 6-3-4-8-6
        - Cycle 9: 6-3-7-14-6
        - Cycle 10: 6-13-15-12-6
        - Cycle 11: 4-8-0-10-4
        - Cycle 12: 4-8-1-14-4
        - Cycle 13: 4-3-7-14-4
        - Cycle 14: 8-0-10-15-8
        - Cycle 15: 8-0-2-6-8
        - Cycle 16: 0-8-4-3-0
        - Cycle 17: 0-8-1-14-0
        - Cycle 18: 0-10-15-12-0
        - Cycle 19: 7-3-4-8-7
        - Cycle 20: 7-3-14-1-7
        - Cycle 21: 7-14-15-10-7
        - Cycle 22: 10-15-13-6-10

Step 2: List of cycles with exactly one chord:
        - <2, (6, 13), 15>
        - <2, (14, 1), 8>
        - <4, (8, 1), 14>
        - <6, (3, 7), 14>
        - <8, (0, 2), 6>
        - <10, (15, 13), 6>
        - <12, (15, 9), 18>
        - <14, (1, 3), 7>
        - <15, (12, 10), 0>

Step 3: Count of unique chordal 4-cycles: [9]
