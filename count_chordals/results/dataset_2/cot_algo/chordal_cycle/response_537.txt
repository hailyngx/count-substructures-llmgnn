Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 8) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 7, 4, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 3, 8, 9)
- Cycle 6: (4, 3, 13, 4)
- Cycle 7: (7, 4, 12, 7)
- Cycle 8: (6, 0, 9, 6)
- Cycle 9: (1, 11, 2, 1)
- Cycle 10: (3, 13, 0, 3)
- Cycle 11: (2, 11, 8, 2)
- Cycle 12: (8, 6, 3, 8)
- Cycle 13: (8, 2, 12, 8)
- Cycle 14: (12, 2, 0, 13, 12)
- Cycle 15: (0, 6, 8, 0)
- Cycle 16: (10, 1, 11, 10)
- Cycle 17: (14, 8, 10, 14)
- Cycle 18: (13, 3, 4, 13)

Step 2:  
Out of the above cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1, (2, 11), 1>
2. <2, (0, 13), 2>
3. <2, (8, 12), 2>
4. <3, (4, 13), 3>
5. <4, (7, 12), 4>
6. <5, (6, 9), 5>
7. <5, (7, 4), 5>
8. <6, (3, 8), 6>
9. <8, (6, 3), 8>
10. <9, (4, 7), 9>
11. <10, (11, 8), 10>
12. <11, (1, 2), 11>
13. <12, (2, 0), 12>
14. <13, (0, 4), 13>
15. <14, (10, 8), 14>

Step 3:  
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [15]
