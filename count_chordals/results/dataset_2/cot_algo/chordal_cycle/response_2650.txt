Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 7 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 2 - 8 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 1 - 9 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 6 - 4 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 7 - 8 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 4 - 6 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 7: 9 - 1 - 5 - 2 - 9
- Cycle 8: 4 - 3 - 1 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 9: 4 - 6 - 7 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 10: 7 - 8 - 6 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 11: 7 - 0 - 3 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 12: 1 - 5 - 6 - 3 - 1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (3, 5)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (0, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 5 chordless cycles found. Therefore, the final answer is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<5, 1, 4, 9>
