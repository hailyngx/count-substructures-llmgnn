Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 

    - Cycle 1: <1, 7, 8, 5>
    - Cycle 2: <1, 7, 9, 13>
    - Cycle 3: <1, 7, 6, 11>
    - Cycle 4: <3, 0, 11, 2>
    - Cycle 5: <3, 0, 11, 6>
    - Cycle 6: <3, 14, 4, 7>
    - Cycle 7: <3, 14, 12, 5>
    - Cycle 8: <0, 3, 14, 12>
    - Cycle 9: <9, 7, 6, 13>
    - Cycle 10: <9, 8, 3, 14>
    - Cycle 11: <6, 7, 1, 2>
    - Cycle 12: <6, 7, 9, 13>
    - Cycle 13: <6, 11, 5, 10>
    - Cycle 14: <5, 8, 3, 14>
    - Cycle 15: <5, 8, 9, 13>
    - Cycle 16: <12, 3, 0, 11>
    - Cycle 17: <12, 3, 14, 4>
    - Cycle 18: <12, 5, 8, 9>
    - Cycle 19: <10, 14, 3, 8>
    - Cycle 20: <10, 14, 12, 5>
    - Cycle 21: <10, 13, 9, 7>
    - Cycle 22: <2, 1, 7, 4>

Step 2:

    - Chordal 4-Cycle 1: <1, (2, 8), 7>

Step 3:

    As there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
