Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 22) (11, 8) (16, 21) (3, 15) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 9) (15, 29) (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 8) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 29) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 1) (21, 16) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 24) (14, 20) (17, 3) (17, 20) (17, 19) (17, 2) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 23) (8, 25) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 1) (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 26) (1, 2) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 12) (20, 7) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 13) (28, 21) (28, 27) (28, 18) (22, 11) (22, 6) (22, 26) (22, 29) (2, 17) (2, 23) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 25) (18, 26) (18, 28) (18, 24) (29, 15) (29, 9) (29, 22) (29, 25) (5, 27) (19, 17) (19, 24) (12, 21) (12, 26) (12, 4) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 24) (25, 8) (25, 4) (25, 29) (24, 21) (24, 18) (24, 19) (24, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <7, 21, 16, 1, 7>
2. <3, 15, 9, 6, 3>
3. <3, 15, 23, 1, 3>
4. <3, 17, 20, 7, 3>
5. <9, 6, 22, 11, 9>
6. <9, 15, 29, 25, 9>
7. <21, 7, 1, 26, 21>
8. <21, 7, 20, 17, 21>
9. <21, 16, 21, 28, 21>
10. <21, 12, 4, 2, 21>
11. <21, 24, 19, 17, 21>
12. <21, 28, 18, 26, 21>
13. <17, 20, 14, 20, 17>
14. <15, 9, 6, 22, 15>
15. <15, 9, 29, 25, 15>
16. <15, 3, 17, 20, 15>
17. <15, 23, 1, 7, 15>
18. <20, 7, 1, 26, 20>
19. <20, 17, 2, 4, 20>
20. <20, 13, 26, 22, 20>
21. <20, 14, 17, 19, 20>
22. <27, 4, 12, 21, 27>
23. <27, 5, 27, 28, 27>
24. <26, 1, 7, 21, 26>
25. <26, 18, 28, 27, 26>
26. <26, 13, 24, 19, 26>
27. <22, 26, 18, 28, 22>
28. <22, 6, 9, 15, 22>
29. <22, 29, 25, 8, 22>
30. <22, 11, 8, 6, 22>
31. <25, 29, 15, 3, 25>
32. <25, 29, 22, 26, 25>
33. <4, 2, 17, 19, 4>
34. <4, 12, 21, 16, 4>
35. <12, 26, 13, 24, 12>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<15, 9, 6, 22, (25, 22)>

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the count is [1].
