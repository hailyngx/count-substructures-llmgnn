Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 2) (1, 11) (1, 27) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 2) (14, 15) (17, 25) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 15) (22, 24) (22, 29) (22, 25) (22, 8) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 25) (0, 12) (27, 1) (27, 0) (27, 4) (8, 22) (8, 19) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 6) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 29) (29, 22) (29, 4) (29, 23) (29, 11) (13, 26) (13, 19) (13, 23) (6, 21) (6, 19) (6, 20) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 11) (16, 10) (16, 23) (3, 12) (28, 8) (28, 7) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 0) (7, 28) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 15) (24, 22) (24, 5) (24, 20) (20, 6) (20, 24) (2, 26) (2, 21) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 24) (23, 29) (23, 13) (23, 16) (23, 12) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        There are several cycles in the graph, but the cycles of interest (with length 4) are:
        - Cycle 1: 12-0-27-1-11-15-8-4-29-22-25-0-12
        - Cycle 2: 12-3-12-9-26-13-19-8-4-27-0-10-21-12
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        There are no cycles with exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are two chordless 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        - <12, 0, 27, 1, 11, 15, 8, 4, 29, 22, 25, 0, 12>
        - <12, 3, 12, 9, 26, 13, 19, 8, 4, 27, 0, 10, 21, 12>
