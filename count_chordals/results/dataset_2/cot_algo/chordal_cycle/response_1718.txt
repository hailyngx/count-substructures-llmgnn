Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 0) (4, 2) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
- (1, 3, 7, 5, 1)
- (1, 5, 13, 2, 1)
- (1, 8, 9, 6, 1)
- (1, 8, 12, 14, 1)
- (1, 3, 10, 11, 1)
- (1, 5, 11, 10, 1)
- (1, 14, 12, 8, 1)
- (3, 10, 12, 8, 3)
- (3, 0, 2, 13, 3)
- (3, 0, 7, 11, 3)
- (14, 12, 10, 11, 14)
- (5, 7, 0, 3, 5)
- (5, 14, 2, 0, 5)
- (5, 11, 10, 12, 5)
- (5, 1, 8, 2, 5)
- (7, 0, 3, 1, 7)
- (7, 3, 10, 11, 7)
- (7, 11, 5, 14, 7)
- (7, 5, 1, 8, 7)
- (7, 0, 6, 9, 7)
- (8, 9, 13, 5, 8)
- (8, 12, 14, 1, 8)
- (8, 12, 10, 3, 8)
- (9, 13, 2, 0, 9)
- (0, 2, 14, 1, 0)
- (0, 6, 9, 8, 0)
- (2, 13, 5, 7, 2)
- (2, 14, 1, 3, 2)
- (10, 11, 7, 5, 10)
- (10, 7, 0, 3, 10)
- (11, 10, 3, 1, 11)
- (11, 7, 5, 1, 11)
- (11, 5, 13, 9, 11)
- (13, 9, 8, 12, 13)
- (12, 8, 1, 3, 12)
- (12, 10, 11, 5, 12)
- (14, 1, 5, 7, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (5, 14), 7, 8>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles found is [40].
