Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 11) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 12) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (6, 9, 4, 13, 3, 8, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 2: (6, 9, 1, 7, 0, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 3: (6, 5, 8, 9, 1, 7, 13, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 4: (9, 1, 7, 13, 4, 12, 8, 9)
        - Cycle 5: (3, 14, 12, 8, 3)
        - Cycle 6: (3, 14, 12, 11, 2, 8, 3)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 8, 9, 4, 13, 3)
        - Cycle 8: (7, 1, 9, 4, 13, 7)
        - Cycle 9: (5, 0, 7, 13, 4, 5)
        - Cycle 10: (2, 8, 5, 0, 11, 2)
        - Cycle 11: (12, 8, 5, 0, 11, 12)
        - Cycle 12: (10, 2, 8, 5, 14, 12, 10)
        - Cycle 13: (11, 2, 10, 12, 14, 3, 11)
        - Cycle 14: (13, 3, 4, 12, 10, 13)
        - Cycle 15: (0, 7, 13, 3, 14, 0)
        - Cycle 16: (4, 9, 1, 7, 0, 11, 4)
        - Cycle 17: (11, 0, 7, 1, 9, 4, 11)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - <1, (5, 6)> - Chorded
        - <2, (1, 7)> - Chorded
        - <3, (5, 8)> - Chorded
        - <4, (1, 9)> - Chorded
        - <5, (8, 12)> - Chorded
        - <6, (2, 8)> - Chorded
        - <7, (8, 9)> - Chorded
        - <8, (1, 9)> - Chorded
        - <9, (0, 7)> - Chorded
        - <10, (11, 2)> - Chorded
        - <11, (12, 8)> - Chorded
        - <12, (12, 14)> - Chorded
        - <13, (13, 11)> - Chorded
        - <14, (4, 12)> - Chorded
        - <15, (5, 14)> - Chorded
        - <16, (7, 1)> - Chorded

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        - There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Putting the final number inside brackets - [16].
