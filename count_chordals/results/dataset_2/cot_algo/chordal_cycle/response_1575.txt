Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 10, 11, 5)
- Cycle 2: (2, 6, 14, 1, 4, 3, 7, 2)
- Cycle 3: (2, 8, 10, 4, 1, 12, 8)
- Cycle 4: (5, 1, 12, 8, 7, 5)
- Cycle 5: (11, 5, 1, 4, 7, 11)
- Cycle 6: (6, 14, 3, 4, 10, 6)
- Cycle 7: (11, 7, 3, 14, 6, 2, 8, 11)
- Cycle 8: (12, 1, 4, 10, 11, 12)
- Cycle 9: (13, 6, 14, 3, 4, 1, 12, 13)
- Cycle 10: (8, 12, 1, 4, 10, 2, 7, 8)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (9, 10), 5> (Chord: (9, 10))
- <2, (6, 1), 4> (Chord: (6, 1))
- <3, (8, 4), 12> (Chord: (8, 4))
- <4, (1, 8), 7> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <5, (5, 4), 7> (Chord: (5, 4))
- <6, (14, 3), 6> (Chord: (14, 3))
- <7, (7, 14), 11> (Chord: (7, 14))
- <8, (10, 1), 12> (Chord: (10, 1))
- <9, (6, 3), 13> (Chord: (6, 3))
- <10, (12, 2), 8> (Chord: (12, 2))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
