- Cycle <0, 8, 12, 5, 6, 0>
- Cycle <1, 0, 2, 7, 14, 12, 1>
- Cycle <1, 2, 7, 14, 5, 12, 1>
- Cycle <1, 2, 4, 14, 7, 10, 1>
- Cycle <1, 10, 7, 14, 5, 12, 1>
- Cycle <2, 0, 8, 12, 5, 6, 2>
- Cycle <2, 0, 8, 12, 1, 2>

- Cycle <4, 9, 11, 5, 12, 14, 7, 4>
- Cycle <4, 9, 14, 7, 10, 6, 2, 4>
- Cycle <4, 13, 3, 6, 5, 12, 14, 4>
- Cycle <5, 6, 10, 7, 14, 12, 8, 0, 5>
- Cycle <5, 6, 12, 14, 7, 10, 3, 13, 5>
- Cycle <6, 5, 12, 1, 10, 7, 14, 3, 6>
- Cycle <6, 10, 7, 14, 5, 11, 9, 4, 6>
- Cycle <7, 2, 1, 8, 12, 5, 6, 10, 7>
- Cycle <9, 4, 13, 3, 6, 10, 7, 14, 9>
- Cycle <11, 5, 12, 1, 10, 7, 14, 9, 11>
- Cycle <13, 3, 6, 10, 7, 14, 5, 11, 13>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 8, 1, (2), 0>
- <0, 8, 12, (5), 14, 7, 2, 0>
- <0, 8, 12, (5), 6, 0>
- <1, 0, (2), 7, 14, 12, 1>
- <1, 2, 7, (14), 5, 12, 1>
- <1, (2), 4, 14, 7, 10, 1>
- <1, 10, 7, (14), 5, 12, 1>
- <2, 0, 8, 12, (5), 6, 2>
- <2, 0, 8, (12), 1, 2>
- <2, 1, 12, (5), 14, 7, 2>
- <2, 3, 6, 5, 12, 1, (0), 2>
- <2, 3, 6, 5, 14, 7, (2)>
- <2, (4), 14, 7, 10, 6, 2>
- <2, 7, 10, 6, 5, 12, 1, (2)>
- <3, 6, 5, 14, 7, 10, (3)>
- <3, 6, 5, 12, 1, (10), 7, 3>
- <4, 9, 11, 5, 12, 14, 7, (4)>
- <4, 9, (14), 7, 10, 6, 2, 4>
- <4, 13, 3, 6, 5, 12, 14, (4)>
- <5, 6, 10, 7, 14, 12, 8, 0, (5)>
- <5, 6, 12, 14, 7, 10, (3), 13, 5>
- <6, 5, 12, 1, 10, 7, 14, (3), 6>
- <6, 10, 7, 14, 5, 11, 9, 4, (6)>
- <7, 2, 1, 8, 12, 5, 6, 10, (7)>
- <9, 4, 13, 3, 6, 10, 7, 14, (9)>
- <11, 5, 12, 1, 10, 7, 14, 9, (11)>
- <13, 3, 6, 10, 7, 14, 5, 11, (13)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 23 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, thus the final count is [23].
