Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-10-5-6
- Cycle 2: 9-10-11-14-9
- Cycle 3: 6-7-5-10-6
- Cycle 4: 9-14-11-12-9
- Cycle 5: 6-12-11-10-6
- Cycle 6: 1-13-4-5-1
- Cycle 7: 11-8-14-9-11
- Cycle 8: 12-7-0-6-12

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- Chordal 4-Cycle 1: <6, (5, 10), 9>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [7].
