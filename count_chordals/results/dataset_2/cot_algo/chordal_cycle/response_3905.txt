Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 19) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 16) (0, 14) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 15) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 19) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 7) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 1) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 18) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 1) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5-6-1-19-17-14-0
- Cycle 2: 5-6-7-9-18-16-14-3
- Cycle 3: 5-6-7-13-2-11-8-9
- Cycle 4: 5-2-13-4-16-14-0
- Cycle 5: 5-2-13-15-11-8-9
- Cycle 6: 5-2-11-8-9-18-10-19
- Cycle 7: 5-2-11-12-6-7-13-15
- Cycle 8: 5-6-12-11-8-9-18-16
- Cycle 9: 5-6-12-2-11-8-19-17

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (17, 3), 19> (Cycle 1 with chord 17-3)
- <2, (16, 14), 0> (Cycle 4 with chord 16-14)
- <3, (15, 13), 11> (Cycle 5 with chord 15-13)
- <4, (10, 18), 9> (Cycle 6 with chord 10-18)
- <5, (11, 8), 18> (Cycle 8 with chord 11-8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (17, 3), 19>
<2, (16, 14), 0>
<3, (15, 13), 11>
<4, (10, 18), 9>
<5, (11, 8), 18>
