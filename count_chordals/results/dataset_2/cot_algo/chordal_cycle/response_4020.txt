This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 19) (25, 20) (25, 19) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 6) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 29) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 11) (22, 5) (22, 29) (26, 20) (26, 27) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 13) (28, 11) (28, 24) (28, 15) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 14) (27, 26) (27, 18) (27, 16) (16, 0) (16, 27) (16, 24) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 12) (7, 3) (7, 29) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (29, 4) (29, 22) (29, 7) (29, 5) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 9) (24, 13) (24, 14) (6, 20) (6, 8) (6, 15) (2, 20) (2, 23) (2, 17) (2, 10) (21, 0) (21, 23) (12, 23) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (13, 11) (13, 24) (13, 12) (9, 24) (9, 12) (5, 22) (5, 29) (18, 8) (18, 27) (18, 15) (15, 28) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 18) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 10) (10, 2) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (3, 7, 29, 5, 3)
- (3, 19, 25, 20, 2, 17, 3)
- (3, 19, 14, 4, 29, 22, 5, 3)
- (25, 20, 26, 27, 16, 0, 21, 23, 2, 25)
- (25, 20, 6, 8, 4, 1, 12, 23, 21, 0, 16, 27, 26, 25)
- (4, 8, 6, 20, 25, 19, 14, 4)
- (8, 4, 29, 22, 5, 29, 7, 3, 17, 2, 20, 26, 27, 18, 8)
- (0, 16, 27, 26, 20, 6, 15, 28, 24, 9, 12, 1, 4, 8, 18, 27, 16)
- (22, 5, 29, 7, 3, 17, 15, 6, 20, 26, 27, 18, 15, 28, 24, 13, 12, 23, 21, 0, 11, 28, 24, 14, 19, 25, 20, 2, 17, 15)
- (26, 20, 6, 8, 18, 15, 17, 3, 19, 14, 24, 13, 12, 1, 4, 29, 22, 5, 29, 7, 3)
- (11, 0, 16, 27, 26, 20, 6, 15, 18, 8, 4, 29, 22, 5, 29, 7, 3, 17, 2, 23, 21, 0, 11)
- (28, 11, 0, 16, 27, 26, 20, 6, 8, 18, 15, 17, 2, 23, 12, 1, 4, 8, 18, 27, 16, 24, 13, 12, 9, 24)
- (19, 3, 7, 29, 22, 5, 29, 4, 8, 18, 27, 16, 0, 21, 23, 12, 13, 24, 14, 19)
- (27, 26, 20, 6, 15, 17, 3, 7, 29, 22, 5, 29, 4, 1, 12, 23, 21, 0, 16, 27)
- (16, 0, 11, 28, 15, 6, 20, 25, 19, 14, 4, 8, 18, 27, 26, 20, 2, 23, 21, 0)
- (23, 2, 17, 15, 28, 11, 13, 12, 1, 4, 29, 22, 5, 29, 7, 3, 19, 25, 20, 26)


Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <3, 19, 25, 20>
- <3, 19, 14, 4>
- <6, 8, 18, 27>
- <7, 29, 5, 22>
- <16, 27, 26, 20>
- <23, 21, 0, 11>
- <12, 1, 4, 8>
- <24, 9, 12, 13>
- <19, 25, 20, 26>


Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are a total of [9] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
