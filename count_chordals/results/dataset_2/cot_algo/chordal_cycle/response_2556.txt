Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, (1, 8), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <15, (0, 5), 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <10, (17, 6), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <11, (7, 17), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <17, (10, 7), 14> 
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <17, (6, 14), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <17, (2, 0), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, (1, 8), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (19, 8), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <8, (3, 1), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <8, (12, 18), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <5, (0, 15), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <6, (17, 14), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <7, (11, 19), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <12, (15, 0), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <13, (18, 12), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <16, (19, 5), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 17 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [17].
