Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 5) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 19) (17, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 16) (8, 11) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 6) (5, 15) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 16) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 19) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 0) (6, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 9) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 14) (16, 8) (16, 13) (14, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 7 - 2 - 1 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 2: 3 - 15 - 5 - 13 - 3
- Cycle 3: 4 - 17 - 19 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 4: 4 - 17 - 19 - 14 - 4

Step 2: Checking for one chord in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (0, 1)
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.

Step 3: Counting chordal 4-cycles found:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, which is <0, (0, 1), 7, 2, 6>.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
