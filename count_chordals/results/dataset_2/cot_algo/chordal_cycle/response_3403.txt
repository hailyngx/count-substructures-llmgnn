Continuing this list for all possible cycles...

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 2: <(1, 7), (3, 9)>
- Cycle 3: <(1, 7), (2, 9)>
- Cycle 7: <(1, 7), (3, 4)>
- Cycle 17: <(1, 7), (8, 4)>
- Cycle 18: <(1, 7), (3, 0)>
- Cycle 19: <(1, 7), (3, 9)>
- Cycle 22: <(1, 2), (7, 9)>
- Cycle 32: <(1, 2), (4, 9)>
- Cycle 48: <(1, 3), (2, 9)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [46]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <(1, 7), (3, 9)>
- <(1, 7), (2, 9)>
- <(1, 7), (3, 4)>
- <(1, 7), (8, 4)>
- <(1, 7), (3, 0)>
- <(1, 2), (7, 9)>
- <(1, 2), (4, 9)>
- <(1, 3), (2, 9)>
