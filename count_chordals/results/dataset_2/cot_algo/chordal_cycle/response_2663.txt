Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-4-3-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-4-3-0
- Cycle 4: 0-2-3-6-0
- Cycle 5: 1-4-6-3-1
- Cycle 6: 2-0-3-4-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (1, 3).
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (2, 4).
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has no chords.
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (0, 3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, (1, 3), 4, 6>
- <0, (2, 4), 3, 6>
- <2, (0, 3), 4, 6>
