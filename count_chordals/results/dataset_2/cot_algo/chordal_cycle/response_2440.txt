Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (4, 6) (4, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-3-1-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-10-8-6
- Cycle 3: 6-9-11-7-12-6
- Cycle 4: 6-9-11-5-13-6
- Cycle 5: 6-3-10-8-6
- Cycle 6: 6-3-9-11-5-6
- Cycle 7: 6-4-12-7-11-6
- Cycle 8: 6-4-12-10-5-6
- Cycle 9: 6-8-10-12-4-6
- Cycle 10: 6-8-9-11-7-6
- Cycle 11: 6-13-5-11-7-6
- Cycle 12: 6-13-12-4-6
- Cycle 13: 6-5-11-7-12-6
- Cycle 14: 6-5-13-12-4-6
- Cycle 15: 6-5-2-14-6

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: <(3, 9)>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: <(8, 10)>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: <(11, 7)>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: <(9, 6)>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: <(3, 10)>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: <(9, 11)>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: <(4, 12)>
- Cycle 8 has one chord: <(5, 10)>
- Cycle 9 has one chord: <(8, 12)>
- Cycle 10 has one chord: <(9, 11)>
- Cycle 11 has one chord: <(5, 13)>
- Cycle 12 has one chord: <(6, 13)>
- Cycle 13 has one chord: <(5, 12)>
- Cycle 14 has one chord: <(5, 12)>

Step 3: Counting chordal 4-cycles:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found as listed above, so the final count is [14].
