Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 10) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 14) (19, 9) (19, 5) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 17) (8, 15) (8, 0) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 0) (2, 3) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 13) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 13) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 3) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 17) (17, 7) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 0) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 16) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 10, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 12, 10, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 1, 16, 4, 6)
- Cycle 4: (9, 10, 12, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 19, 5, 16, 4, 11, 7, 15, 8, 0, 1, 6, 4, 16, 3, 13, 14, 18, 17, 0, 8, 15, 7, 11, 4, 16, 1, 0, 17, 18, 13, 3, 16, 5, 19, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 10, 6) - Chord: (9, 10)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 12, 10, 6) - Chord: (9, 10)
- Cycle 3: (6, 1, 16, 4, 6) - Chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 4: (9, 10, 12, 9) - Chord: (10, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is listed below:
- <6, 9, 10, 6> with chord (9, 10)
- <6, 9, 12, 10, 6> with chord (9, 10)
- <6, 1, 16, 4, 6> with chord (1, 4)
- <9, 10, 12, 9> with chord (10, 12)
