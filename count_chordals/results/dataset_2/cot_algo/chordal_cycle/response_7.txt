Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 3) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 18) (13, 10) (13, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 16) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 18) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 3) (15, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 15) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 10, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 4, 16, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 3, 18, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 18, 8, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 4, 8, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 14, 0, 2, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 14, 0, 2, 15, 2, 19, 16, 1, 17, 5)
- Cycle 8: (9, 5, 14, 0, 2, 19, 16, 1, 17, 3, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 5, 14, 0, 2, 19, 16, 4, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 5, 14, 0, 2, 19, 16, 1, 7, 12, 11, 10, 6, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 5, 14, 0, 2, 19, 16, 4, 8, 18, 9)
- Cycle 12: (6, 9, 4, 8, 5, 14, 0, 2, 15, 10, 6)
- Cycle 13: (5, 14, 0, 2, 15, 10, 13, 8, 18, 3, 17, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (3, 18), 4, 5>
- <2, (0, 14), 15, 5>
- <3, (10, 6), 13, 8>
- <4, (19, 16), 1, 17>
- <5, (0, 14), 15, 2>
- <6, (0, 14), 15, 10>
- <7, (18, 8), 4, 9>
- <8, (18, 3), 17, 5>
- <9, (16, 4), 9, 5>
- <10, (14, 0), 2, 19>
- <11, (14, 0), 2, 15>
- <12, (2, 15), 10, 6>
- <13, (2, 15), 10, 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 13 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
