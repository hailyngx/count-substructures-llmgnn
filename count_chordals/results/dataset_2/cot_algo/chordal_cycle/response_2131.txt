Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- (4, 8, 2, 4)
- (4, 11, 5, 3, 12, 4)
- (4, 11, 1, 7, 12, 4)
- (4, 11, 1, 6, 13, 4)
- (4, 2, 9, 13, 4)
- (7, 12, 10, 8, 2, 7)
- (7, 12, 10, 3, 5, 11, 7)
- (7, 12, 11, 1, 6, 13, 7)
- (7, 12, 3, 5, 11, 4, 2, 8, 7)
- (7, 13, 9, 8, 2, 4, 11, 7)
- (8, 2, 9, 13, 6, 1, 11, 4)
- (12, 7, 1, 11, 5, 3, 10, 12)
- (12, 9, 13, 6, 1, 11, 4, 8, 10, 12)
- (2, 8, 9, 13, 6, 1, 11, 4, 12, 7, 10, 2)
- (5, 11, 1, 6, 13, 9, 2, 4, 12, 3, 5)
- (13, 7, 1, 11, 4, 2, 9, 6, 14, 10, 3, 13)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following chordal 4-cycles:
1. <4, (8, 2), 4>
2. <4, (11, 1), 4>
3. <4, (11, 5), 4>
4. <4, (3, 12), 4>
5. <4, (13, 6), 4>
6. <7, (10, 8), 7>
7. <7, (10, 3), 7>
8. <7, (11, 1), 7>
9. <7, (13, 6), 7>
10. <7, (2, 9), 7>
11. <8, (9, 13), 8>
12. <12, (11, 1), 12>
13. <12, (13, 6), 12>
14. <2, (9, 13), 2>
15. <5, (3, 12), 5>
16. <13, (9, 2), 13>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have a total of [16].
