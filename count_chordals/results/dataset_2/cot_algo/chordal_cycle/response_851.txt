Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Here are the cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 1 - 4 - 12 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 1 - 3 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 13 - 2 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 5: 6 - 7 - 3 - 10 - 6
- Cycle 6: 9 - 0 - 2 - 11 - 9
- Cycle 7: 9 - 14 - 4 - 12 - 9
- Cycle 8: 8 - 7 - 3 - 0 - 8
- Cycle 9: 1 - 7 - 3 - 11 - 1
- Cycle 10: 1 - 14 - 4 - 10 - 1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

After checking each cycle, we find that Cycle 1 (5 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 5) and Cycle 5 (6 - 7 - 3 - 10 - 6) are chordal cycles with exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles found is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, (1, 9), 8>
- <6, (3, 10), 7>
