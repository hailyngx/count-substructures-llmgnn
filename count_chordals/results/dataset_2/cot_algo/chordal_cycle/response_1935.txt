Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (11, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 12) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 10, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 1, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 7, 14, 2, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 9, 7, 14, 2, 5, 4, 1, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 9, 7, 14, 3, 10, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 10, 6) - No chord
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 1, 6) - No chord
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 7, 14, 2, 6) - Chord: (7, 2)
- Cycle 4: (6, 9, 7, 14, 2, 5, 4, 1, 6) - Chord: (2, 4)
- Cycle 5: (6, 9, 7, 14, 3, 10, 6) - No chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count is [2].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are <3, (7, 14), 10, 6)> and <4, (2, 4), 1, 6)>.
