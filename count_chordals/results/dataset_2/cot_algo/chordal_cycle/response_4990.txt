Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-2-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-3-4-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-0-12-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-9-4-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-12-13-1
- Cycle 6: 1-6-13-3-1
- Cycle 7: 1-7-3-4-1
- Cycle 8: 1-7-11-10-1
- Cycle 9: 1-7-11-14-1
- Cycle 10: 1-7-8-4-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <1, 4, 13, 3>
- <1, 6, 0, 12>
- <1, 7, 11, 10>
- <1, 7, 8, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [0] chordless cycles found.
