Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 3-0-12-4-3
- Cycle 2: 1-14-2-13-1
- Cycle 3: 8-10-4-12-8
- Cycle 4: 1-7-5-6-1
- Cycle 5: 9-0-12-8-9
- Cycle 6: 6-5-10-13-6
- Cycle 7: 2-14-9-1-2
- Cycle 8: 7-5-10-8-7

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 0-12
- Cycle 2 has a chord 14-13
- Cycle 3 has a chord 4-8
- Cycle 4 has a chord 5-6
- Cycle 5 has a chord 0-8
- Cycle 6 has a chord 10-13
- Cycle 7 has a chord 14-9
- Cycle 8 has a chord 5-8

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: There are no unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
