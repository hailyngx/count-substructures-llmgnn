Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 3) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 12) (3, 13) (3, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 14) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 1 - 11 - 13 - 3 - 9 - 2 - 10 - 6 - 5 - 1 - 0
2. Cycle 2: 1 - 7 - 0 - 4 - 2 - 8 - 9 - 10 - 12 - 3 - 13 - 11 - 5 - 6 - 14 - 9 - 2 - 1

Step 2:
Checking for chordal cycles:
Cycle 1 has two chords: (1, 9) and (11, 5).
Cycle 2 has no chords.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, 9, 11, 5, 1>
