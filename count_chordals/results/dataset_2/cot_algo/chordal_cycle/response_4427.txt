Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 2) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 19) (5, 16) (5, 17) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (18, 12) (18, 10) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 3) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 19) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 11 - 14 - 15 - 9 - 11
- Cycle 2: 11 - 17 - 15 - 9 - 11
- Cycle 3: 11 - 4 - 9 - 15 - 11
- Cycle 4: 11 - 8 - 1 - 14 - 11
- Cycle 5: 16 - 7 - 3 - 2 - 16
- Cycle 6: 16 - 5 - 17 - 2 - 16
- Cycle 7: 16 - 5 - 17 - 15 - 16
- Cycle 8: 14 - 1 - 19 - 13 - 14
- Cycle 9: 17 - 2 - 3 - 7 - 17
- Cycle 10: 17 - 5 - 16 - 2 - 17
- Cycle 11: 6 - 9 - 15 - 10 - 6
- Cycle 12: 6 - 12 - 19 - 1 - 6

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, (8, 11), 14> (Chord: (8, 11))
2. <2, (17, 5), 16> (Chord: (17, 5))
3. <3, (7, 16), 17> (Chord: (7, 16))
4. <6, (9, 15), 10> (Chord: (9, 15))
5. <9, (4, 15), 11> (Chord: (4, 15))
6. <12, (6, 19), 1> (Chord: (6, 19))
7. <13, (10, 15), 14> (Chord: (10, 15))
8. <16, (5, 17), 2> (Chord: (5, 17))

Step 3:
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles is [8].
