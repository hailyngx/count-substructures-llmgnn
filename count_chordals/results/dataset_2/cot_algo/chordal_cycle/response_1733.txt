Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 19) (15, 0) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (11, 13) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 16) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 12) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 16) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 6) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 9) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 18) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1, 14) (6, 16) (6, 7) (4, 10) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-8-12-2-0
- Cycle 2: 1-18-12-2-1
- Cycle 3: 5-10-4-5
- Cycle 4: 5-10-17-19-5
- Cycle 5: 5-16-0-15-5
- Cycle 6: 5-16-7-13-5
- Cycle 7: 7-13-11-13-7
- Cycle 8: 7-13-5-19-7
- Cycle 9: 7-13-5-16-7
- Cycle 10: 7-16-1-14-7
- Cycle 11: 7-16-0-8-7
- Cycle 12: 9-3-2-12-9
- Cycle 13: 9-17-7-13-9
- Cycle 14: 9-17-10-5-9
- Cycle 15: 9-12-18-14-9
- Cycle 16: 10-17-19-15-10
- Cycle 17: 12-18-14-1-12

Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, only one of them has exactly one chord:
- <9, (17, 12), 3>

Step 3:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
