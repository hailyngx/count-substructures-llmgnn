Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: 1-9-3-1
- Cycle 2: 1-9-12-3-1
- Cycle 3: 1-9-12-8-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-12-4-11-1
- Cycle 5: 1-9-12-0-4-11-1
- Cycle 6: 1-3-12-8-1
- Cycle 7: 1-3-12-4-11-1
- Cycle 8: 1-3-12-0-4-11-1
- Cycle 9: 1-8-12-3-1
- Cycle 10: 1-6-8-12-3-1
- Cycle 11: 3-12-8-1
- Cycle 12: 3-12-4-11-1
- Cycle 13: 3-12-0-4-11-1
- Cycle 14: 8-12-4-11-1
- Cycle 15: 8-12-0-4-11-1

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (9, 3).
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (9, 12).
- Cycle 4 has 2 chords.
- Cycle 5 has 3 chords.
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (3, 12).
- Cycle 7 has 2 chords.
- Cycle 8 has 3 chords.
- Cycle 9 has 2 chords.
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (1, 12).
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (3, 8).
- Cycle 12 has 2 chords.
- Cycle 13 has 3 chords.
- Cycle 14 has 3 chords.
- Cycle 15 has 4 chords.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found.

Final Answer: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<1, 9, 3, 1>, <1, 9, 12, 3, 1>
