Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-9-7-5-4
- Cycle 2: 1-4-6-5-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-5-7-1
- Cycle 4: 1-8-2-5-1
- Cycle 5: 3-1-8-9-3
- Cycle 6: 3-5-2-6-3
- Cycle 7: 3-8-9-0-3
- Cycle 8: 5-7-9-0-5
- Cycle 9: 6-4-5-7-6
- Cycle 10: 0-9-7-5-0

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (4, 6), 9> (Cycle 1)
- <2, (5, 6), 1> (Cycle 2)
- <3, (1, 5), 7> (Cycle 3)
- <4, (2, 8), 1> (Cycle 4)
- <5, (1, 8), 3> (Cycle 5)
- <6, (2, 5), 3> (Cycle 6)
- <7, (8, 9), 3> (Cycle 7)
- <8, (7, 9), 5> (Cycle 8)
- <9, (4, 5), 7> (Cycle 9)
- <10, (0, 9), 7> (Cycle 10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [10].
