Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 2, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 3, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 8, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 5, 1, 6)
- Cycle 5: (9, 8, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 8, 1, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 5, 7, 9)
- Cycle 8: (1, 0, 9, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 5, 7, 1)
- Cycle 10: (3, 6, 9, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 6, 5, 3)
- Cycle 12: (3, 1, 5, 3)
- Cycle 13: (4, 8, 5, 4)
- Cycle 14: (5, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 15: (5, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 16: (5, 1, 3, 5)
- Cycle 17: (0, 9, 6, 0)
- Cycle 18: (2, 9, 6, 2)
- Cycle 19: (2, 9, 4, 2)
- Cycle 20: (7, 9, 6, 7)

Step 2:
- Checking for chords in the cycles above:
    - <1, (6, 9), 5>: (6, 9) is the chord in this cycle.
    - <2, (6, 9), 3>: (6, 9) is the chord in this cycle.
    - <3, (6, 9), 8>: (6, 9) is the chord in this cycle.
    - <4, (6, 5), 1>: (6, 5) is the chord in this cycle.
    - <5, (8, 9), 4>: (8, 9) is the chord in this cycle.
    - <6, (8, 9), 1>: (8, 9) is the chord in this cycle.
    - <7, (5, 7), 9>: (5, 7) is the chord in this cycle.
    - <8, (0, 9), 1>: (0, 9) is the chord in this cycle.
    - <9, (1, 5), 3>: (1, 5) is the chord in this cycle.
    - <10, (3, 6), 9>: (3, 6) is the chord in this cycle.
    - <11, (1, 5), 6>: (1, 5) is the chord in this cycle.
    - <12, (1, 5), 6>: (1, 5) is the chord in this cycle.
    - <13, (4, 8), 5>: (4, 8) is the chord in this cycle.
    - <14, (9, 5), 6>: (9, 5) is the chord in this cycle.

Step 3: 
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [14]
