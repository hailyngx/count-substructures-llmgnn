Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 15) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 19) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 18) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 5) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 19) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 11) (5, 14) (5, 17) (5, 12) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 18) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 10) (12, 0) (12, 5) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 16) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 10) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 7, 2, 10>
2. <0, 7, 6, 18>
3. <0, 14, 7, 2>
4. <0, 14, 5, 12>
5. <3, 7, 2, 10>
6. <3, 7, 6, 18>
7. <3, 9, 8, 4>
8. <4, 8, 9, 19>
9. <4, 11, 19, 9>
10. <5, 14, 7, 2>
11. <5, 17, 19, 11>
12. <6, 18, 10, 2>
13. <7, 0, 14, 6>
14. <7, 2, 10, 18>
15. <8, 4, 11, 19>
16. <9, 3, 7, 6>
17. <9, 19, 11, 4>
18. <10, 2, 7, 0>
19. <10, 16, 13, 15>
20. <11, 4, 8, 9>
21. <12, 0, 14, 6>
22. <13, 15, 1, 15>
23. <13, 16, 2, 7>
24. <13, 18, 6, 14>
25. <15, 1, 15, 13>
26. <15, 4, 11, 19>
27. <16, 13, 15, 1>
28. <17, 0, 14, 6>
29. <17, 5, 12, 0>
30. <18, 6, 14, 0>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 7, 14, 6> (chord: (7, 14))
2. <0, 14, 7, 2> (chord: (14, 7))
3. <3, 9, 8, 4> (chord: (9, 8))
4. <4, 11, 19, 9> (chord: (11, 9))
5. <5, 17, 19, 11> (chord: (17, 11))
6. <6, 18, 10, 2> (chord: (18, 10))
7. <7, 0, 14, 6> (chord: (0, 14))
8. <8, 4, 11, 19> (chord: (4, 11))
9. <9, 3, 7, 6> (chord: (3, 7))
10. <10, 16, 13, 15> (chord: (16, 13))
11. <13, 15, 1, 15> (chord: (15, 1))
12. <16, 13, 15, 1> (chord: (13, 15))
13. <17, 5, 12, 0> (chord: (5, 12))

Step 3:
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [13].
