Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 0) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 9, 13, 0> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 10, 12, 0> 
- Cycle 3: <0, 12, 2, 5, 0> 
- Cycle 4: <1, 10, 12, 3, 1> 
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 5, 2, 1> 
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 3, 11, 1> 
- Cycle 7: <2, 12, 3, 11, 2> 
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 3, 14, 2> 
- Cycle 9: <3, 9, 1, 7, 3> 
- Cycle 10: <3, 12, 10, 1, 3> 
- Cycle 11: <4, 8, 13, 9, 4> 
- Cycle 12: <4, 10, 6, 2, 4> 
- Cycle 13: <5, 7, 1, 10, 5> 
- Cycle 14: <5, 12, 3, 9, 5> 
- Cycle 15: <6, 10, 1, 7, 6> 
- Cycle 16: <6, 14, 2, 12, 6> 
- Cycle 17: <7, 1, 9, 13, 7> 
- Cycle 18: <7, 5, 2, 12, 7> 
- Cycle 19: <8, 13, 9, 3, 8> 
- Cycle 20: <10, 1, 9, 13, 10> 
- Cycle 21: <11, 3, 12, 10, 11> 
- Cycle 22: <11, 7, 5, 2, 11> 
- Cycle 23: <12, 3, 9, 1, 12> 
- Cycle 24: <14, 3, 12, 0, 14> 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 9, 13, 1, (10, 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 7, 5, 2, (12, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, 5, 3, 14, (12, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <10, 1, 9, 13, (12, 3)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found. There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [4].
