Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1:

- Cycle 4: (4, 1, 6, 3, 9, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 2, 1, 8, 5, 6, 4, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 8, 1, 6, 5, 2, 7)
- Cycle 7: (5, 0, 4, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 6, 1, 2, 4, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 8, 7, 4, 0, 5)
- Cycle 10: (6, 1, 2, 7, 8, 5, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 3, 9, 4, 0, 5, 6)
- Cycle 12: (2, 4, 0, 5, 8, 7, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 5, 8, 7, 4, 0, 2)
- Cycle 14: (1, 4, 0, 5, 6, 1)
- Cycle 15: (1, 6, 5, 8, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 16: (1, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1)
- Cycle 17: (1, 8, 7, 4, 0, 5, 1)
- Cycle 18: (3, 6, 5, 0, 4, 9, 3)
- Cycle 19: (9, 4, 0, 5, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 20: (9, 7, 8, 5, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 21: (9, 1, 2, 7, 8, 5, 6, 9)

Step 2: 
List of cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles):
- <1, (2, 8), 7, 4>
- <2, (1, 5), 6, 4>
- <3, (4, 0), 5, 6>
- <4, (5, 1), 2, 7>
- <5, (6, 3), 4, 9>

Step 3: 
Count of chordless cycles found: [16]
