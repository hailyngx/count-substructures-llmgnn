Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 2, 1, 4) with edges (5, 2), (2, 1), (1, 4), (4, 5)
- (5, 6, 7, 4) with edges (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 4), (4, 5)
- (9, 8, 7, 4) with edges (9, 8), (8, 7), (7, 4), (4, 9)
- (3, 2, 1, 4) with edges (3, 2), (2, 1), (1, 4), (4, 3)
- (3, 8, 9, 7) with edges (3, 8), (8, 9), (9, 7), (7, 3)
- (0, 5, 6, 7) with edges (0, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal cycles are:
- <1, (4, 5), 2>
- <4, (7, 6), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 4 chordless cycles found: 
<ul>
<li>[4]</li>
</ul>
