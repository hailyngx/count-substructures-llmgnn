Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 4) (9, 2) (26, 22) (26, 27) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 24) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 28) (28, 13) (29, 16) (29, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 11) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 27) (22, 10) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 12) (6, 1) (6, 21) (6, 0) (6, 16) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 5) (16, 29) (16, 6) (16, 25) (16, 20) (23, 20) (23, 27) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 5) (4, 11) (11, 2) (11, 4) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 27) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 24) (18, 10) (18, 25) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 23) (27, 19) (27, 10) (3, 13) (3, 29) (3, 19) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 18) (10, 27) (20, 16) (20, 23) (12, 8) (12, 14) (17, 15) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 16) (25, 18) (25, 15) (24, 1) (24, 5) (15, 17) (15, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are a total of 4-cycles in the graph: <1, 6, 21, 4>, <6, 21, 4, 5>, <21, 4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 8, 25>, <5, 8, 25, 16>, <8, 25, 16, 29>, <25, 16, 29, 3>, <16, 29, 3, 13>, <29, 3, 13, 8>, <3, 13, 8, 2>, <13, 8, 2, 11>, <8, 2, 11, 4>, etc. (Total number of 4-cycles is too long to list all here)

Step 2:
Checking for each 4-cycle if there is exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges):
- <1, 6, 21, 4> has a chord (1, 21)
- <6, 21, 4, 5> has a chord (21, 5)
- <21, 4, 5, 8> is chordless
- <4, 5, 8, 25> is chordless
- <5, 8, 25, 16> has a chord (8, 16), also has a chord (5, 25)
- <8, 25, 16, 29> has a chord (8, 29), also has a chord (25, 16)
- <25, 16, 29, 3> is chordless
- <16, 29, 3, 13> is chordless
- <29, 3, 13, 8> is chordless
- <3, 13, 8, 2> has a chord (13, 2), also has a chord (3, 8)
- <13, 8, 2, 11> is chordless
- <8, 2, 11, 4> has a chord (2, 4), also has a chord (8, 11)

Step 3:
Number of unique chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
The unique chordal 4-cycles are: <1, 6, 21, 4>, <6, 21, 4, 5>, <5, 8, 25, 16>, <8, 25, 16, 29>, <8, 2, 11, 4>
