Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 11) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 13, 11, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 7, 6, 3, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 10, 7, 4, 5, 9)
- Cycle 4: (10, 7, 6, 12, 8, 10)
- Cycle 5: (11, 1, 8, 12, 3, 11)
- Cycle 6: (14, 9, 2, 13, 11, 14)
- Cycle 7: (4, 0, 8, 12, 6, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 14, 3, 12, 6, 7)
- Cycle 9: (0, 8, 12, 3, 14, 0)
- Cycle 10: (1, 11, 13, 2, 9, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, 9, 2, 13, 11> (Chord: (9, 11))
- <5, 4, 7, 6, 3> (Chord: (4, 6))
- <9, 10, 7, 4, 5> (Chord: (10, 4))
- <10, 7, 6, 12, 8> (Chord: (7, 12))
- <11, 1, 8, 12, 3> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <14, 9, 2, 13, 11> (Chord: (9, 11))
- <4, 0, 8, 12, 6> (Chord: (0, 8))
- <7, 14, 3, 12, 6> (Chord: (14, 12))
- <0, 8, 12, 3, 14> (Chord: (8, 3))
- <1, 11, 13, 2, 9> (Chord: (11, 2))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
