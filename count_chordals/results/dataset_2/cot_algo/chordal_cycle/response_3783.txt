Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 19) (15, 8) (15, 19) (19, 18) (19, 15) (17, 6) (17, 8) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 16) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 7, 16, 2, 12)
- Cycle 2: (0, 7, 18, 10, 14)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 8, 4, 7)
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 17, 6, 14)
- Cycle 5: (1, 13, 9, 12, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 16, 5, 4, 7)
- Cycle 7: (2, 14, 6, 17, 8)
- Cycle 8: (3, 4, 8, 15, 19)
- Cycle 9: (3, 13, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 10: (4, 7, 18, 19, 15)
- Cycle 11: (4, 8, 17, 6, 14)
- Cycle 12: (5, 4, 8, 17, 6)
- Cycle 13: (5, 7, 18, 19, 15)
- Cycle 14: (6, 14, 10, 18, 7)
- Cycle 15: (8, 1, 0, 7, 4)
- Cycle 16: (8, 4, 7, 18, 10)
- Cycle 17: (9, 12, 2, 16, 5)
- Cycle 18: (9, 13, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 19: (10, 14, 6, 17, 8)
- Cycle 20: (13, 1, 8, 17, 6)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (2, 12), 3>
- Cycle 2: <2, (0, 18), 10>
- Cycle 3: <3, (1, 8), 4>
- Cycle 4: <5, (6, 14), 17>
- Cycle 5: <7, (9, 12), 13>
- Cycle 7: <8, (6, 14), 17>
- Cycle 10: <11, (4, 18), 7>
- Cycle 11: <14, (6, 17), 8>
- Cycle 16: <16, (7, 18), 10>
- Cycle 17: <17, (2, 16), 5>
- Cycle 18: <18, (0, 7), 13>
- Cycle 19: <19, (14, 17), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, hence [10].
