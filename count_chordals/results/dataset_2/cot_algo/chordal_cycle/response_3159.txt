Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle: (5, 9, 4, 0) with edges (5, 9), (9, 4), (4, 0), (0, 5)
- Cycle: (6, 9, 1, 10) with edges (6, 9), (9, 1), (1, 10), (10, 6)
- Cycle: (6, 4, 2, 10) with edges (6, 4), (4, 2), (2, 10), (10, 6)
- Cycle: (14, 0, 12, 10) with edges (14, 0), (0, 12), (12, 10), (10, 14)
- Cycle: (13, 6, 4, 2) with edges (13, 6), (6, 4), (4, 2), (2, 13)
- Cycle: (7, 5, 9, 11) with edges (7, 5), (5, 9), (9, 11), (11, 7)
- Cycle: (7, 14, 3, 2) with edges (7, 14), (14, 3), (3, 2), (2, 7)
- Cycle: (1, 0, 4, 9) with edges (1, 0), (0, 4), (4, 9), (9, 1)
- Cycle: (1, 10, 2, 4) with edges (1, 10), (10, 2), (2, 4), (4, 1)

Step 2: 
- Chordal 4-cycle found:
    - <(5, 9), (4, 0)>

Step 3: 
Number of chordless 4-cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <(5, 9), (4, 0)>
