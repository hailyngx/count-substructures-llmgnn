        - Cycle 5: <16, 13, 17, 13>
        - Cycle 6: <16, 15, 7, 5>
        - Cycle 7: <16, 15, 6, 14>
        - Cycle 8: <7, 15, 16, 11>
        - Cycle 9: <7, 15, 6, 14>
        - Cycle 10: <12, 7, 15, 16>
        - Cycle 11: <12, 7, 5, 13>

        - Cycle 13: <2, 12, 10, 1>
        - Cycle 14: <2, 14, 6, 15>
        - Cycle 15: <2, 14, 19, 16>
        - Cycle 16: <14, 19, 16, 15>
        - Cycle 17: <5, 7, 15, 16>
        - Cycle 18: <5, 7, 12, 2>
        - Cycle 19: <5, 13, 16, 15>
        - Cycle 20: <13, 17, 13, 16>
        - Cycle 21: <13, 17, 13, 5>
        - Cycle 22: <17, 13, 5, 7>
        - Cycle 23: <19, 14, 2, 12>
        - Cycle 24: <19, 14, 0, 3>
        - Cycle 25: <6, 15, 16, 11>
        - Cycle 26: <6, 15, 7, 12>
        - Cycle 27: <6, 14, 2, 12>
        - Cycle 28: <6, 14, 19, 16>
        - Cycle 29: <1, 11, 16, 15>
        - Cycle 30: <1, 11, 18, 11>
        - Cycle 31: <1, 11, 4, 10>
        - Cycle 32: <1, 9, 8, 10>
        - Cycle 33: <1, 9, 8, 10>
        - Cycle 34: <1, 10, 12, 7>
        - Cycle 35: <1, 10, 12, 2>
        - Cycle 36: <1, 10, 4, 11>
        - Cycle 37: <1, 0, 14, 19>
        - Cycle 38: <1, 0, 3, 0>
        
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
        - <7, 15, 16, 11> has one chord (11, 16): <7, 15, (11, 16), 11>
        - <5, 7, 15, 16> has one chord (7, 15): <5, (7, 15), 16, 11>
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
