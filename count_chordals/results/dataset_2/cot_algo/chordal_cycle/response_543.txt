Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-2-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-8-5
- Cycle 3: 5-4-8-5
- Cycle 4: 5-7-2-5
- Cycle 5: 9-1-4-8-9
- Cycle 6: 8-6-2-5-8
- Cycle 7: 8-3-7-5-8
- Cycle 8: 1-7-5-8-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

After checking each cycle, we find that Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 4, and Cycle 7 each have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles is [4].

Therefore, in this graph, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <5, 9, 2, 5> (Chord: (9, 2))
2. <5, 9, 8, 5> (Chord: (9, 8))
3. <5, 7, 2, 5> (Chord: (7, 2))
4. <8, 3, 7, 5, 8> (Chord: (3, 7))
