Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 6-9-2-5-6
- Cycle 2: 6-11-10-12-6
- Cycle 3: 6-11-8-4-6
- Cycle 4: 6-12-7-10-6
- Cycle 5: 2-9-11-8-2
- Cycle 6: 2-9-3-13-2
- Cycle 7: 4-10-12-7-4
- Cycle 8: 4-10-11-8-4
- Cycle 9: 4-10-7-12-4
- Cycle 10: 4-13-5-14-4
- Cycle 11: 8-11-10-4-8
- Cycle 12: 8-11-12-7-8
- Cycle 13: 7-10-11-8-7
- Cycle 14: 7-12-6-11-7
- Cycle 15: 12-6-7-10-12
- Cycle 16: 12-10-11-8-12
- Cycle 17: 12-5-14-0-12
- Cycle 18: 5-2-9-3-5
- Cycle 19: 5-2-14-0-5
- Cycle 20: 5-12-7-10-5
- Cycle 21: 5-12-13-3-5
- Cycle 22: 13-4-10-7-13
- Cycle 23: 13-4-5-12-13
- Cycle 24: 13-3-9-2-13
- Cycle 25: 1-6-7-12-1
- Cycle 26: 1-6-11-10-1
- Cycle 27: 3-9-2-5-3
- Cycle 28: 3-9-11-8-3
- Cycle 29: 3-13-4-10-3
- Cycle 30: 0-14-5-12-0
- Cycle 31: 0-14-4-13-0
- Cycle 32: 0-1-6-11-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Unique chordal 4-cycles identified: 
  - <2, (9, 5), 3>
  - <4, (10, 12), 7>
  - <8, (11, 4), 7>
  - <11, (6, 7), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
