Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 18) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 6) (16, 2) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 9) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 3) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 18) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 18) (14, 8) (14, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 19) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 2) (18, 10) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle 1: (4, 7, 12, 5, 4)
2. Cycle 2: (10, 17, 1, 11, 10)
3. Cycle 3: (19, 10, 17, 13, 19)
4. Cycle 4: (6, 7, 12, 11, 6)

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
1. <1, (17, 13), 11, (18, 3)> 

Step 3:
Final number of chordless cycles: [3]
