Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4 or more:
  - Cycle 1: (11, 16, 18, 5)
  - Cycle 2: (1, 3, 9, 24)
  - Cycle 3: (10, 8, 23, 27)
  - Cycle 4: (0, 20, 27, 21)
  - Cycle 5: (26, 18, 16, 11)
  - Cycle 6: (13, 26, 0, 25)
  - Cycle 7: (18, 5, 2, 14)
  - Cycle 8: (14, 4, 21, 10)
  - Cycle 9: (5, 2, 14, 6)
  - Cycle 10: (23, 8, 25, 19)
  - Cycle 11: (27, 21, 4, 14)
  - Cycle 12: (12, 23, 8, 25)

Step 2: 
- Checking for chords:
  - Cycle 1 has a chord (11, 18)
  - Cycle 2 has a chord (3, 24)
  - Cycle 3 has a chord (8, 27)
  - Cycle 4 has a chord (20, 27)
  - Cycle 5 has a chord (16, 11)
  - Cycle 6 has a chord (26, 25)
  - Cycle 7 has a chord (5, 14)
  - Cycle 8 has a chord (21, 10)
  - Cycle 9 has a chord (2, 6)
  - Cycle 10 has a chord (8, 19)
  - Cycle 11 has a chord (21, 14)
  - Cycle 12 has a chord (8, 25)

Step 3:
- Count of chordal 4-cycles: [12]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <11, (16, 18), 5>
- <1, (3, 24), 9>
- <10, (8, 27), 23>
- <0, (20, 27), 21>
- <26, (18, 16), 11>
- <13, (26, 0), 25>
- <18, (5, 2), 14>
- <14, (4, 21), 10>
- <5, (2, 14), 6>
- <23, (8, 25), 19>
- <27, (21, 4), 14>
- <12, (23, 8), 25>
