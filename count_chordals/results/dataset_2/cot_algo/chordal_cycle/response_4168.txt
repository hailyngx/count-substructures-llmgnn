Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 12) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 2, 10, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 4, 7, 11, 9)
- Cycle 3: (7, 0, 12, 8, 7)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 6, 2, 1)
- Cycle 5: (12, 10, 2, 6, 12)
- Cycle 6: (11, 14, 13, 0, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Among the listed cycles, the following chordal 4-cycle is found:
  <1, (3, 6), 2, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There is a total of [5] chordless cycles present in the graph.
