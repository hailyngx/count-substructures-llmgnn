Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 2) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 5) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 10) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-9-4
- Cycle 2: 1-12-0-4
- Cycle 3: 1-3-13-0
- Cycle 4: 1-6-0-4
- Cycle 5: 1-3-9-8
- Cycle 6: 1-3-9-11
- Cycle 7: 1-3-10-9
- Cycle 8: 1-3-10-6
- Cycle 9: 1-12-11-9
- Cycle 10: 1-12-11-6

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
<1, (3, 13), 0)>
<1, (6, 0), 4)>
<1, (3, 9), 8)>
<1, (3, 10), 9)>
<1, (12, 11), 9)>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [5].
