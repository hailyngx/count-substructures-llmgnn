Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 4) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 19) (0, 2) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 12) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 6) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 0-14-9-1-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-2-14-3-0
        - Cycle 3: 0-19-5-18-0
        - Cycle 4: 0-19-8-6-0
        - Cycle 5: 3-14-9-1-3
        - Cycle 6: 3-4-18-15-3
        - Cycle 7: 3-1-9-14-3
        - Cycle 8: 4-3-14-2-4
        - Cycle 9: 4-18-15-12-4
        - Cycle 10: 4-6-8-9-4
        - Cycle 11: 4-6-15-7-4
        - Cycle 12: 5-18-4-11-5
        - Cycle 13: 5-19-0-2-5
        - Cycle 14: 5-19-8-9-5
        - Cycle 15: 6-4-18-12-6
        - Cycle 16: 6-8-9-13-6
        - Cycle 17: 6-13-9-14-6
        - Cycle 18: 7-15-18-4-7
        - Cycle 19: 7-2-14-0-7
        - Cycle 20: 7-17-14-3-7
        - Cycle 21: 8-19-5-18-8
        - Cycle 22: 8-6-4-18-8
        - Cycle 23: 8-9-14-17-8
        - Cycle 24: 9-14-17-7-9
        - Cycle 25: 12-15-18-4-12
        - Cycle 26: 13-9-1-3-13
        - Cycle 27: 13-6-8-19-13
        - Cycle 28: 14-0-19-5-14
        - Cycle 29: 15-18-4-11-15
        - Cycle 30: 15-6-8-19-15

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - <1, (2, 4), 3>
        - <2, (0, 19), 5>
        - <5, (8, 18), 19>
        - <6, (8, 15), 13>
        - <8, (9, 17), 19>
        - <12, (4, 18), 15>
        - <13, (1, 8), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 30 chordless cycles found, so the final number is [30].
