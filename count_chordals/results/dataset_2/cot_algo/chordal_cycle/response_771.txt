Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
1. Cycle 0-4-7-9-1-5-3
2. Cycle 0-4-5-6-7-9-1
3. Cycle 0-4-5-7-6-2-3
4. Cycle 3-2-6-5-7-4-0
5. Cycle 3-2-6-5-4-0-8
6. Cycle 3-8-9-1-5-4-0
7. Cycle 5-4-0-6-2-3-8
8. Cycle 5-4-0-8-3-2-6
9. Cycle 5-7-6-2-3-4-0
10. Cycle 6-2-3-8-0-4-5

Step 2:
Among the above cycles, the only chordal 4-cycle is:
- <1, (5, 7), 3>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].
