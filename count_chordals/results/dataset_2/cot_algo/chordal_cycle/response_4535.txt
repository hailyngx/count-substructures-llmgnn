Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 8, 4, 1, 10, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 8, 7, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 3, 4, 1, 10, 2, 6, 0, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 4, 7, 6, 2, 10, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 4, 9, 6, 2, 10, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 0, 6, 9, 4, 7, 8, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 0, 1, 4, 7, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 8: (9, 6, 7, 4, 1, 10, 2, 6)
- Cycle 9: (9, 6, 7, 4, 3, 5, 0, 6)
- Cycle 10: (9, 6, 7, 14, 12, 11, 1, 0, 6)
- Cycle 11: (4, 9, 6, 7, 8, 5, 0, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 9, 6, 7, 14, 12, 11, 13, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 9, 6, 0, 1, 10, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 7, 8, 5, 0, 1, 10, 2, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 7, 8, 5, 3, 14, 12, 11, 4)
- Cycle 16: (4, 3, 5, 0, 1, 10, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 17: (4, 3, 5, 0, 6, 2, 10, 1, 4)
- Cycle 18: (7, 8, 5, 0, 1, 10, 2, 6, 7)
- Cycle 19: (7, 8, 5, 3, 14, 12, 11, 1, 7)
- Cycle 20: (6, 9, 4, 7, 8, 5, 0, 6)
- Cycle 21: (6, 9, 4, 1, 10, 2, 6, 0, 6)
- Cycle 22: (6, 9, 4, 3, 5, 0, 6, 7)
- Cycle 23: (6, 7, 8, 5, 3, 4, 9, 6)
- Cycle 24: (6, 7, 8, 5, 0, 1, 4, 6)
- Cycle 25: (6, 7, 4, 1, 10, 2, 6, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <5, (4, 1), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [25] chordless cycles.
