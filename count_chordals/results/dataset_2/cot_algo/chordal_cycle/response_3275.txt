Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <5, 1, 6, 4, 7>
- <5, 1, 3, 0, 9>
- <5, 6, 4, 2, 1>
- <5, 7, 9, 8, 6>
- <9, 7, 1, 3, 0>
- <9, 8, 6, 4, 2>
- <6, 8, 5, 1, 3>
- <1, 3, 5, 7, 9>
- <3, 0, 9, 7, 1>
- <4, 2, 6, 8, 9>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <5, 1, 6, 4, 7> - Chord: (1, 4)
- <5, 1, 3, 0, 9> - Chord: (1, 9)
- <5, 6, 4, 2, 1> - Chord: (2, 4)
- <5, 7, 9, 8, 6> - Chord: (7, 8)
- <9, 7, 1, 3, 0> - Chord: (1, 3)
- <9, 8, 6, 4, 2> - Chord: (6, 4)
- <6, 8, 5, 1, 3> - Chord: (1, 5)
- <1, 3, 5, 7, 9> - Chord: (3, 5)
- <3, 0, 9, 7, 1> - Chord: (0, 9)
- <4, 2, 6, 8, 9> - Chord: (2, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
As there are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, we put the final number inside brackets: [10].
