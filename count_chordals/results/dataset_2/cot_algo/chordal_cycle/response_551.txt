Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (16, 2) (16, 14) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 2) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 18) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 18) (15, 6) (19, 7) (7, 19) (7, 13) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 12) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 4) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 18) (12, 11) (12, 14) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 13, 7)
- Cycle 2: (2, 17, 1, 8)
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 13, 10)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 13, 7)
- Cycle 5: (2, 17, 10, 14)
- Cycle 6: (6, 9, 13, 3)
- Cycle 7: (2, 17, 10, 13)
- Cycle 8: (6, 9, 4, 0)
- Cycle 9: (3, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 10: (1, 4, 0, 9)
- Cycle 11: (1, 4, 0, 2)
- Cycle 12: (1, 4, 0, 3)
- Cycle 13: (1, 4, 9, 13)
- Cycle 14: (1, 4, 9, 6)
- Cycle 15: (1, 5, 18, 8)
- Cycle 16: (1, 5, 18, 6)
- Cycle 17: (1, 5, 18, 15)
- Cycle 18: (1, 5, 18, 8)
- Cycle 19: (1, 17, 2, 16)
- Cycle 20: (0, 4, 9, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, 9, (13, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, 17, (1, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, 9, (13, 10)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 9, (13, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 17, (10, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, 9, (13, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <2, 17, (10, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, 9, (4, 0)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <3, 6, (9, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <0, 4, (9, 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are [10] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
