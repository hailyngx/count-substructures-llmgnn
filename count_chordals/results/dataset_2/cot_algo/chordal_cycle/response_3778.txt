Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (6, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (18, 10) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 19) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 12) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 13) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 14) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 19) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 18) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 17) (0, 19) (17, 2) (17, 0) (14, 7) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (11, 1, 16, 15, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 1, 7, 2, 8, 11)
- Cycle 3: (11, 16, 15, 5, 4, 3, 11)
- Cycle 4: (11, 16, 12, 13, 0, 11)
- Cycle 5: (11, 8, 2, 7, 1, 11)
- Cycle 6: (16, 15, 5, 12, 16)
- Cycle 7: (16, 12, 13, 0, 17, 2, 8, 11, 16)
- Cycle 8: (16, 1, 7, 14, 7, 2, 11, 16)
- Cycle 9: (5, 12, 15, 16, 1, 7, 2, 8, 11, 3, 4, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (8, 11), 16>
- <1, (2, 7), 11>
- <1, (12, 13), 16>
- <1, (7, 2), 11>
- <12, (13, 0), 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
