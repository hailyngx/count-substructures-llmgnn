Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (17, 19) (17, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 18) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (0, 10) (0, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 18) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 15) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (15, 14) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 5) (12, 5) (12, 19) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 12) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 16) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- (1, 6, 7, 3, 5, 0) is a cycle of length 6.
- (1, 6, 11, 4, 2) is a cycle of length 5.
- (8, 9, 14, 15, 2) is a cycle of length 5.
- (8, 9, 14, 15, 5) is a cycle of length 5.
- (8, 9, 19, 12, 5) is a cycle of length 5.
- (10, 7, 6, 11, 4) is a cycle of length 5.
- (10, 7, 6, 1, 2) is a cycle of length 5.
- (10, 7, 3, 5, 12) is a cycle of length 5.
- (10, 19, 17, 7, 6) is a cycle of length 5.
- (10, 19, 9, 8, 10) is a cycle of length 5.
- (11, 6, 7, 3, 16) is a cycle of length 5.
- (14, 9, 8, 10, 7) is a cycle of length 5.
- (14, 9, 19, 17, 7) is a cycle of length 5.
- (14, 15, 7, 6, 11) is a cycle of length 5.
- (15, 2, 4, 11, 6) is a cycle of length 5.
- (15, 2, 1, 6, 7) is a cycle of length 5.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Among the listed cycles, the following have exactly one chord:
  <1, (6, 7), 3, 5>
  <1, 6, 11, (4, 2)>
  <8, 9, (14, 15), 2>
  <8, 9, (14, 15), 5>
  <8, 9, 19, 12, 5>
  <10, 7, (6, 11), 4>
  <10, 7, (6, 1), 2>
  <10, 7, 3, 5, 12>
  <10, 19, 17, 7, 6>
  <10, 19, 9, (8, 10)>
  <11, 6, 7, 3, (16, 4)>
  <14, 9, 8, 10, (7, 19)>
  <14, 9, 19, (17, 7)>
  <14, 15, 7, 6, (11, 14)>
  <15, (2, 1), 6, 7>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.
- Therefore, the final count is [15].
