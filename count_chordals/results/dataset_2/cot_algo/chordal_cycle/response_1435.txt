Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10)

- Cycle 27: (14, 9, 6, 1, 14)
- Cycle 28: (14, 0, 13, 3, 14)
- Cycle 29: (14, 12, 7, 8, 14)
- Cycle 30: (14, 3, 0, 13, 14)
- Cycle 31: (14, 1, 4, 10, 14)
- Cycle 32: (5, 8, 13, 11, 5)

- Cycle 34: (3, 13, 8, 7, 3)
- Cycle 35: (3, 12, 6, 1, 3)
- Cycle 36: (3, 0, 9, 6, 3)
- Cycle 37: (3, 14, 10, 4, 3)
- Cycle 38: (11, 6, 1, 4, 11)
- Cycle 39: (1, 6, 12, 7, 1)
- Cycle 40: (1, 13, 8, 7, 1)
- Cycle 41: (1, 14, 10, 4, 1)
- Cycle 42: (10, 0, 9, 6, 10)
- Cycle 43: (10, 14, 3, 13, 10)
- Cycle 44: (10, 5, 8, 13, 10)
- Cycle 45: (4, 11, 13, 8, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

The unique chordal 4-cycle is:

- <1, (6, 9), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There is only one chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
