Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 4) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-10-8-13-1
- Cycle 2: 2-9-5-12-2
- Cycle 3: 2-9-11-7-1-6-10-2
- Cycle 4: 2-9-11-4-10-2
- Cycle 5: 2-9-11-7-1-4-10-2
- Cycle 6: 3-8-10-6-1-7-3
- Cycle 7: 4-10-6-1-7-11-4
- Cycle 8: 4-10-8-13-3-7-11-4
- Cycle 9: 4-10-9-5-12-2-4
- Cycle 10: 4-11-7-1-6-10-4
- Cycle 11: 5-9-11-7-1-12-5
- Cycle 12: 5-9-11-4-10-8-5
- Cycle 13: 5-9-11-7-3-13-5
- Cycle 14: 7-1-6-10-8-13-7
- Cycle 15: 7-1-6-10-4-11-7
- Cycle 16: 7-1-12-5-14-3-7
- Cycle 17: 7-3-0-12-1-4-11-7
- Cycle 18: 10-6-1-7-3-13-10
- Cycle 19: 10-6-1-7-11-4-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, 9, 11, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 19 cycles in total.
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
