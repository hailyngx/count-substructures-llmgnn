        - Cycle 1: (2, 17, 3, 6, 2)
        - Cycle 2: (2, 17, 10, 12, 2)
        - Cycle 3: (2, 16, 12, 6, 2)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 15, 5, 18, 4)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 15, 2, 17, 4)
        - Cycle 6: (4, 9, 16, 12, 4)
        - Cycle 7: (5, 15, 2, 16, 5)
        - Cycle 8: (6, 3, 17, 10, 6)

        - Cycle 14: (8, 1, 18, 5, 8)
        - Cycle 15: (8, 1, 18, 9, 8)
        - Cycle 16: (8, 7, 8, 1, 8)
        - Cycle 17: (10, 17, 2, 15, 10)
        - Cycle 18: (10, 12, 16, 19, 10)
        - Cycle 19: (12, 10, 17, 3, 12)
        - Cycle 20: (12, 16, 9, 18, 12)
        - Cycle 21: (13, 11, 0, 8, 13)

        - Cycle 25: (15, 4, 9, 18, 15)
        - Cycle 26: (16, 2, 15, 5, 16)
        - Cycle 27: (16, 9, 14, 13, 16)
        - Cycle 28: (17, 2, 16, 12, 17)
        - Cycle 29: (17, 10, 12, 16, 17)
        - Cycle 30: (18, 9, 16, 12, 18)
        - Cycle 31: (19, 10, 12, 6, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <2, (3, 6), 17>
        - <2, (10, 12), 17>
        - <2, (12, 16), 4>
        - <4, (15, 5), 18>
        - <4, (15, 2), 17>
        - <4, (16, 12), 9>
        - <5, (15, 2), 16>
        - <6, (10, 17), 3>
        - <6, (10, 17), 12>
        - <6, (12, 16), 9>
        - <6, (16, 2), 19>
        - <8, (0, 5), 15>
        - <8, (0, 11), 13>
        - <8, (1, 18), 5>
        - <8, (1, 18), 9>
        - <8, (1, 8), 7>
        - <10, (2, 15), 17>
        - <10, (12, 16), 19>
        - <12, (10, 17), 3>
        - <12, (16, 9), 18>
        - <13, (11, 0), 14>
        - <14, (9, 16), 2>
        - <15, (2, 16), 12>
        - <15, (4, 9), 18>
        - <16, (2, 15), 5>
        - <16, (9, 14), 13>
        - <17, (2, 16), 12>
        - <17, (10, 12), 16>
        - <18, (9, 16), 12>
        - <19, (10, 12), 6>
