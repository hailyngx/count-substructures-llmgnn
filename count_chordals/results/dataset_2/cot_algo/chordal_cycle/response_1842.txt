Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 5) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 4) (2, 18) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 12) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 11) (3, 2) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 19) (1, 10) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 19) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 0) (16, 14) (16, 12) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle: 14-17-5-13-14
        - Cycle: 14-8-13-5-14
        - Cycle: 14-16-12-18-14
        - Cycle: 14-19-7-2-14
        - Cycle: 17-5-6-10-17
        - Cycle: 8-13-15-1-8
        - Cycle: 8-9-0-12-8
        - Cycle: 13-7-2-11-13
        - Cycle: 10-6-0-12-10
        - Cycle: 10-4-11-2-10
        - Cycle: 2-18-12-16-2
        - Cycle: 5-6-11-19-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle: <14, 17, (5, 13), 14>
        - Cycle: <14, 8, (13, 5), 14>
        - Cycle: <14, 16, (12, 18), 14>
        - Cycle: <14, 19, (7, 2), 14>
        - Cycle: <17, 5, (6, 10), 17>
        - Cycle: <8, 13, (15, 1), 8>
        - Cycle: <8, 9, (0, 12), 8>
        - Cycle: <13, 7, (2, 11), 13>
        - Cycle: <10, 6, (0, 12), 10>
        - Cycle: <10, 4, (11, 2), 10>
        - Cycle: <2, 18, (12, 16), 2>
        - Cycle: <5, 6, (11, 19), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <14, 17, (5, 13), 14>
        <14, 8, (13, 5), 14>
        <14, 16, (12, 18), 14>
        <14, 19, (7, 2), 14>
        <17, 5, (6, 10), 17>
        <8, 13, (15, 1), 8>
        <8, 9, (0, 12), 8>
        <13, 7, (2, 11), 13>
        <10, 6, (0, 12), 10>
        <10, 4, (11, 2), 10>
        <2, 18, (12, 16), 2>
        <5, 6, (11, 19), 5>
