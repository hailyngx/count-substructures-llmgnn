Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 19) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 10) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 0) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 12) (2, 12) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 19) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 2) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (19, 17) (19, 7) (10, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <3, 6, 5, 8, 1> (length 4 cycle)
- <5, 6, 3, 15, 18> (length 4 cycle)
- <5, 6, 16, 1, 9> (length 4 cycle)
- <5, 6, 13, 11, 2> (length 4 cycle)
- <5, 8, 14, 12, 0> (length 4 cycle)
- <8, 14, 7, 16, 6> (length 4 cycle)
- <9, 1, 8, 5, 18> (length 4 cycle)
- <12, 0, 18, 4, 9> (length 4 cycle)
- <12, 14, 7, 11, 2> (length 4 cycle)
- <13, 5, 18, 4, 9> (length 4 cycle)
- <16, 6, 5, 18, 0> (length 4 cycle)
- <16, 7, 14, 12, 0> (length 4 cycle)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
- <3, 6, 5, 8, 1> (Chord: (6, 8))
- <5, 6, 13, 11, 2> (Chord: (6, 11))
- <16, 7, 14, 12, 0> (Chord: (7, 12))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <3, 6, 5, 8, 1> with chord (6, 8)
- <5, 6, 13, 11, 2> with chord (6, 11)
- <16, 7, 14, 12, 0> with chord (7, 12)
