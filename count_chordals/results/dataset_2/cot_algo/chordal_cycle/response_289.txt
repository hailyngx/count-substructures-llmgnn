Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 3, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 2, 0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 0, 1)
- Cycle 5: (2, 3, 7, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 3, 4, 6, 2)
- Cycle 7: (4, 3, 7, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 6, 0, 2, 4)
- Cycle 9: (5, 8, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 8, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 11: (5, 7, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 4, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 13: (7, 3, 4, 9, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 8, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 15: (9, 6, 0, 1, 9)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <1, (2, 3), 6>: Chord is (2, 3)
- <1, (4, 6), 3>: Chord is (4, 6)
- <2, (0, 1), 3>: Chord is (0, 1)
- <2, (4, 6), 3>: Chord is (4, 6)
- <5, (7, 8), 2>: Chord is (7, 8)
- <5, (6, 9), 8>: Chord is (6, 9)
- <5, (4, 6), 7>: Chord is (4, 6)
- <7, (3, 4), 9>: Chord is (3, 4)
- <9, (0, 1), 6>: Chord is (0, 1)
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number inside brackets is [6].
