Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (29, 26) (29, 13) (29, 23) (29, 21) (3, 21) (25, 19) (25, 14) (22, 23) (22, 10) (23, 29) (23, 22) (23, 4) (12, 2) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 11) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 20) (27, 13) (27, 16) (4, 23) (4, 26) (8, 10) (8, 21) (6, 12) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 26) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 24) (5, 16) (13, 29) (13, 27) (13, 18) (26, 29) (26, 4) (26, 6) (26, 28) (26, 14) (21, 29) (21, 3) (21, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (14, 26) (14, 10) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 19) (10, 22) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 0) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 24) (11, 18) (24, 27) (24, 28) (24, 11) (24, 1) (7, 6) (7, 28) (15, 0) (15, 17) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 1) (17, 6) (17, 15) (1, 24) (1, 19) (1, 20) (1, 16) (20, 27) (20, 1) (9, 16) (16, 27) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 9) (18, 13) (18, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles with a length of 4:
- Cycle 1: (2, 12, 11, 2)
- Cycle 2: (2, 14, 10, 2)
- Cycle 3: (2, 11, 24, 27, 12, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 14, 25, 19, 0, 10, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 11, 18, 13, 27, 12, 2)
- Cycle 6: (29, 26, 4, 23, 29)
- Cycle 7: (29, 26, 6, 12, 11, 29)
- Cycle 8: (29, 26, 6, 28, 7, 29)
- Cycle 9: (29, 26, 14, 10, 22, 23, 29)
- Cycle 10: (3, 21, 8, 10, 0, 19, 25, 14, 2, 11, 12, 6, 28, 7, 15, 17, 6, 26, 4, 23, 22, 10, 8, 21, 29, 13, 27, 24, 1, 19, 1, 20, 27, 13, 18, 11, 18, 13, 29)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (10, 14), 25>
- <2, (12, 27), 6>
- <3, (21, 8), 29>
- <4, (26, 23), 29>
- <5, (16, 27), 1>
- <6, (6, 28), 26>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [6].
