Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 18) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 15) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 15) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 4) (15, 14) (15, 2) (15, 5) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 9) (16, 7) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 19) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 18) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 17) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 11) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 7) (12, 0) (13, 1) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 1-3-14-15-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-5-15-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-10-8-1
- Cycle 4: 1-14-15-5-1
- Cycle 5: 3-5-15-14-3
- Cycle 6: 3-5-15-2-3
- Cycle 7: 3-10-9-0-3
- Cycle 8: 3-10-8-1-3
- Cycle 9: 14-15-5-3-14
- Cycle 10: 14-15-2-6-14
- Cycle 11: 14-0-18-3-14
- Cycle 12: 15-5-3-10-15
- Cycle 13: 15-5-18-0-15
- Cycle 14: 5-3-18-0-5
- Cycle 15: 9-10-3-14-9
- Cycle 16: 9-10-8-1-9
- Cycle 17: 0-18-3-10-0
- Cycle 18: 18-5-15-2-18

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 15, 14, 3>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 17 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final chordless cycle count is [17].
