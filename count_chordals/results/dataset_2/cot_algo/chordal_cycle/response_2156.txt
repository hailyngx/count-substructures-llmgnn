Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0-5-1-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-8-1-0
- Cycle 3: 5-1-9-2-5
- Cycle 4: 7-0-5-2-7
- Cycle 5: 4-8-7-2-4
- Cycle 6: 1-9-2-7-1
- Cycle 7: 3-1-8-4-3
- Cycle 8: 0-3-2-4-0
- Cycle 9: 7-0-3-1-7
- Cycle 10: 5-2-7-8-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (2, 5)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (0, 2)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (0, 1)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (2, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 10 cycles with exactly one chord, so the number of chordal 4-cycles is [10].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 3, 2, 4, 0>
- <0, 4, 8, 1, 0>
- <0, 5, 1, 3, 0>
- <1, 9, 2, 7, 1>
- <2, 7, 8, 5, 2>
- <3, 1, 8, 4, 3>
- <4, 8, 7, 2, 4>
- <5, 1, 9, 2, 5>
- <7, 0, 3, 1, 7>
- <7, 0, 5, 2, 7>
