Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 2
- Cycle 2: 2 -> 5 -> 9 -> 8 -> 2
- Cycle 3: 2 -> 5 -> 9 -> 6 -> 2
- Cycle 4: 2 -> 5 -> 9 -> 4 -> 2
- Cycle 5: 2 -> 6 -> 9 -> 8 -> 2
- Cycle 6: 2 -> 6 -> 9 -> 4 -> 2
- Cycle 7: 2 -> 4 -> 9 -> 8 -> 2
- Cycle 8: 2 -> 4 -> 9 -> 6 -> 2
- Cycle 9: 2 -> 8 -> 9 -> 6 -> 2
- Cycle 10: 2 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4 -> 2
- Cycle 11: 2 -> 6 -> 4 -> 8 -> 2
- Cycle 12: 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 6 -> 2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 4)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (6, 4)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (4, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 12 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.

Final answer: [12]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <2, 5, 4, 6> with chord (5, 4)
- <2, 5, 9, 8> with chord (9, 8)
- <2, 5, 9, 6> with chord (9, 6)
- <2, 5, 9, 4> with chord (9, 4)
- <2, 6, 9, 8> with chord (9, 8)
- <2, 6, 9, 4> with chord (9, 4)
- <2, 4, 9, 8> with chord (9, 8)
- <2, 4, 9, 6> with chord (9, 6)
- <2, 8, 9, 6> with chord (9, 8)
- <2, 8, 9, 4> with chord (9, 4)
- <2, 6, 4, 8> with chord (6, 4)
- <2, 4, 8, 6> with chord (4, 8)
