Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 8) (26, 12) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 29) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 28) (17, 23) (17, 22) (6, 2) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 18) (11, 2) (20, 29) (20, 22) (20, 24) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 21) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 21) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 23) (7, 18) (16, 22) (16, 14) (4, 23) (12, 26) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 0) (22, 17) (22, 11) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 19) (8, 26) (8, 27) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 0) (28, 10) (28, 8) (14, 3) (14, 16) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (24, 3) (24, 20) (24, 13) (0, 19) (0, 8) (0, 21) (21, 29) (21, 25) (21, 0) (13, 1) (13, 24) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 11) (18, 7) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle {9, 26, 25, 27}
2. Cycle {9, 26, 8, 27}
3. Cycle {1, 3, 8, 2}
4. Cycle {7, 9, 26, 8}
5. Cycle {7, 9, 27, 8}
6. Cycle {7, 10, 28, 8}
7. Cycle {19, 22, 20, 29}
8. Cycle {21, 29, 20, 24}
9. Cycle {24, 20, 22, 19}
10. Cycle {0, 19, 22, 16}
11. Cycle {2, 9, 26, 8}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle {9, 26, 25, 27} has a chord {26, 27}.
- The cycle {9, 26, 8, 27} has a chord {26, 27}.
- The cycle {1, 3, 8, 2} has a chord {3, 2}.
- The cycle {7, 9, 26, 8} has a chord {9, 8}.
- The cycle {7, 9, 27, 8} has a chord {9, 8}.
- The cycle {7, 10, 28, 8} has a chord {10, 8}.
- The cycle {19, 22, 20, 29} has a chord {22, 20}.
- The cycle {21, 29, 20, 24} has a chord {29, 20}.
- The cycle {24, 20, 22, 19} has a chord {20, 22}.
- The cycle {0, 19, 22, 16} has a chord {19, 22}.
- The cycle {2, 9, 26, 8} has a chord {9, 8}.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
