Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 16) (6, 17) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 13) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 4) (12, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 12) (18, 15) (18, 0) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 7) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (16, 15) (16, 14) (16, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 5, 8, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 8, 19, 5, 3)
- Cycle 3: (9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 10, 8, 3, 5, 19, 11, 9)
- Cycle 5: (3, 5, 19, 11, 14, 13, 7, 17, 6, 3)
- Cycle 6: (15, 18, 0, 1, 13, 14, 16, 2, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (3, 5, 8, 3) <3, 5>
- Cycle 2: (3, 8, 19, 5, 3) <19, 8>
- Cycle 3: (9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 9) <0, 1>
- Cycle 4: (9, 10, 8, 3, 5, 19, 11, 9) <10, 8>
- Cycle 5: (3, 5, 19, 11, 14, 13, 7, 17, 6, 3) <14, 7>
- Cycle 6: (15, 18, 0, 1, 13, 14, 16, 2, 15) <0, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are [5] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <3, 5, 8, 3>
- <3, 8, 19, 5, 3>
- <9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 9>
- <9, 10, 8, 3, 5, 19, 11, 9>
- <15, 18, 0, 1, 13, 14, 16, 2, 15>
