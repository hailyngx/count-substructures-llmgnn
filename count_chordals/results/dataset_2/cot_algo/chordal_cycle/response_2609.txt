Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 1 - 4 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 7 - 8 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 6 - 4 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 0 - 3 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 7: 4 - 3 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 8: 7 - 8 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 9: 1 - 2 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 10: 3 - 0 - 9 - 3
- Cycle 11: 6 - 8 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 12: 8 - 0 - 9 - 8
- Cycle 13: 2 - 1 - 5 - 2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Only Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: 9 - 4

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the number is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<5, 9, 4, 6> with a chord (9, 4)
