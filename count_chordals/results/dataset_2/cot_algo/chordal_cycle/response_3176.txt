Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 15) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 17) (10, 4) (10, 15) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 17) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 3) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 1) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (14, 1) (16, 18) (16, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 15) (6, 8) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 14) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        {0, 2, 7, 3, 11, 15, 17, 4, 8}
        {1, 5, 9, 19}
        {1, 5, 12, 8}
        {1, 14, 13, 6}
        {3, 11, 15, 10}
        {3, 11, 13, 16}
        {4, 8, 12, 3}
        {4, 10, 15, 11}
        {7, 2, 0, 13}
        {7, 2, 1, 5}
        {7, 3, 12, 8}
        {9, 5, 12, 8}
        {9, 19, 18, 16}
        {11, 3, 12, 8}
        {15, 17, 7, 2}

    Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - Chordal cycle: {1, 5, 9, 19} with chord (5, 9) 
    - Chordal cycle: {1, 5, 12, 8} with chord (5, 8)
    - Chordal cycle: {3, 11, 13, 16} with chord (11, 16)
    - Chordal cycle: {11, 3, 12, 8} with chord (3, 8)

    Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = [10]

    Unique chordal 4-cycles:
    <1, (5, 9), 19>
    <1, (5, 12), 8>
    <3, (11, 13), 16>
    <11, (3, 12), 8>
