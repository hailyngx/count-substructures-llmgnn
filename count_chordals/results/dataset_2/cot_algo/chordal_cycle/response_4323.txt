Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 2)
- Cycle 2: (2, 5, 7, 3, 2)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 4, 1, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 3, 8, 5)
- Cycle 5: (7, 4, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 3, 2, 8, 7)
- Cycle 7: (4, 1, 3, 2, 4)
- Cycle 8: (1, 3, 7, 5, 1)

Step 2: 
Checking for a unique chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 2 has chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 3 has chord (4, 1)
- Cycle 4 has chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 5 has chord (3, 1)
- Cycle 6 has chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 7 has chord (3, 2)
- Cycle 8 has chord (3, 1)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (1, 7), 2, 5>
2. <2, (2, 7), 5, 7>
3. <4, (4, 1), 5, 7>
4. <5, (5, 7), 7, 3>
5. <7, (3, 1), 4, 1>
6. <7, (7, 8), 3, 2>
7. <3, (3, 1), 7, 5>
8. <1, (1, 7), 2, 5>
