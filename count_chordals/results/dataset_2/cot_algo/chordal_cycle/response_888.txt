Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 10 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 12 - 5 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 14 - 3 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 5: 1 - 14 - 2 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 6: 2 - 8 - 4 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 7: 2 - 8 - 14 - 1 - 2
- Cycle 8: 2 - 9 - 6 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 9: 2 - 9 - 13 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 10: 2 - 13 - 3 - 5 - 2
- Cycle 11: 2 - 14 - 0 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 12: 3 - 0 - 4 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 13: 3 - 0 - 6 - 9 - 3
- Cycle 14: 3 - 5 - 7 - 4 - 3
- Cycle 15: 3 - 7 - 6 - 0 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 6, 0> has chord (4, 6)
- <2, 8, 4, 6, 2> has chord (4, 6)
- <3, 5, 7, 4, 3> has chord (5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [12]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, (4, 6), 0>
- <2, (4, 6), 8, 2>
- <3, 5, (7, 4), 3>
