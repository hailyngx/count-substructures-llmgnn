Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (1, 7, 4, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 7, 12, 11, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 2, 4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 12, 11, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 8, 14, 7, 3)
- Cycle 6: (5, 1, 7, 14, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 1, 2, 3, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 8, 3, 12, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 8, 14, 7, 5)
- Cycle 10: (0, 1, 7, 14, 0)
- Cycle 11: (0, 1, 2, 3, 0)
- Cycle 12: (0, 9, 11, 12, 0)
- Cycle 13: (0, 9, 10, 13, 0)
- Cycle 14: (0, 5, 14, 7, 0)
- Cycle 15: (0, 5, 8, 3, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, (2, 4), 5>
- <1, (12, 11), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
