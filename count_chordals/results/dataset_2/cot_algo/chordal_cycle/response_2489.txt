Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 1) (3, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-3-13-5
- Cycle 2: 5-3-4-13-5
- Cycle 3: 5-4-7-10-5
- Cycle 4: 5-7-2-13-5
- Cycle 5: 5-0-6-12-5
- Cycle 6: 6-10-7-4-6
- Cycle 7: 6-4-13-2-6
- Cycle 8: 6-2-0-12-6
- Cycle 9: 4-7-10-3-4
- Cycle 10: 4-13-2-12-4

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for a chord, we find that the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (1, 13), 3, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (3, 13), 4, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (4, 7), 10, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (7, 2), 13, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, (7, 10), 4, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (4, 13), 2, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, (2, 12), 0, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, (7, 10), 3, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (13, 2), 12, 4>

Step 3:
Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found, we get a total of [9].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, (1, 13), 3, 5>
<5, (3, 13), 4, 5>
<5, (4, 7), 10, 5>
<5, (7, 2), 13, 5>
<6, (7, 10), 4, 6>
<6, (4, 13), 2, 6>
<6, (2, 12), 0, 6>
<4, (7, 10), 3, 4>
<4, (13, 2), 12, 4>
