Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 9) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 2) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 18) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (0, 16) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 17) (19, 2) (19, 17) (19, 13) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (1, 5) (1, 13) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 16) (18, 15) (18, 3) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 9) (17, 8) (3, 2) (3, 18) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 1) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: 4-10-11-5-4
        - Cycle 2: 4-10-13-7-4
        - Cycle 3: 4-14-5-1-4
        - Cycle 4: 4-17-2-19-4
        - Cycle 5: 7-12-9-10-7
        - Cycle 6: 7-13-1-5-7
        - Cycle 7: 7-8-11-10-7
        - Cycle 8: 10-9-12-7-10
        - Cycle 9: 10-13-1-5-10
        - Cycle 10: 11-5-14-16-11
        - Cycle 11: 12-9-15-18-12
        - Cycle 12: 14-16-0-15-14
        - Cycle 13: 15-9-10-13-15
        - Cycle 14: 15-18-3-2-15
        - Cycle 15: 16-14-5-1-16
        - Cycle 16: 17-2-12-7-17
        - Cycle 17: 17-8-11-5-17
        - Cycle 18: 19-2-12-9-19
        - Cycle 19: 19-13-1-5-19

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - <1, (5, 10), 4>
        - <2, (4, 19), 17>
        - <3, (2, 18), 15>
        - <5, (1, 16), 14>
        - <7, (4, 13), 10>
        - <9, (12, 15), 9>
        - <11, (5, 14), 16>
        - <13, (1, 19), 5>
        - <17, (2, 7), 12>
        - <19, (13, 1), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are [10] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
