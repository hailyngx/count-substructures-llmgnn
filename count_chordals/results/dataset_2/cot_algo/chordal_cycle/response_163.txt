Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 24) (9, 20) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 3) (3, 26) (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 17) (4, 19) (4, 28) (7, 14) (7, 13) (25, 1) (1, 25) (1, 5) (1, 12) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 14) (27, 16) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 22) (20, 9) (20, 26) (20, 0) (20, 21) (2, 17) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 21) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 28) (6, 3) (6, 5) (22, 26) (22, 0) (22, 14) (22, 11) (8, 5) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 8) (24, 9) (24, 0) (24, 11) (11, 22) (11, 24) (11, 28) (28, 4) (28, 5) (28, 11) (28, 17) (10, 15) (10, 16) (10, 14) (13, 7) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 28) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 8) (21, 20) (21, 18) (16, 27) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 10) (14, 7) (14, 27) (14, 22) (14, 10) (14, 29) (29, 27) (29, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: {9, 26, 3, 15, 9}
- Cycle 2: {9, 26, 20, 0, 24, 9}
- Cycle 3: {9, 26, 22, 14, 7, 13, 29, 27, 16, 0, 20, 9}
- Cycle 4: {9, 26, 20, 21, 18, 16, 27, 29, 14, 22, 0, 24, 9}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (3, 15), 9> (Chordal 4-cycle): {9, 26, 3, 15, 9}
- <0, (20, 24), 9> (Chordal 4-cycle): {9, 26, 20, 0, 24, 9}
- <22, (14, 7), 26> (Chordal 4-cycle): {9, 26, 22, 14, 7, 13, 29, 27, 16, 0, 20, 9}
- <18, (16, 27), 21> (Chordal 4-cycle): {9, 26, 20, 21, 18, 16, 27, 29, 14, 22, 0, 24, 9}

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
