Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 17) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 18) (18, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 6) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 13) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 1) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (15, 4) (15, 0) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 16) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 13, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 17, 16, 1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (10, 4, 8, 18, 10)
- Cycle 4: (11, 17, 13, 5, 7, 11)
- Cycle 5: (2, 6, 11, 17, 13, 0, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 6, 0, 15, 4, 10, 11, 6)
- Cycle 7: (2, 6, 0, 15, 4, 8, 18, 10, 11, 6)
- Cycle 8: (2, 6, 0, 15, 4, 10, 14, 12, 2, 6)
- Cycle 9: (11, 6, 2, 12, 14, 10, 4, 15, 0, 6, 11)
- Cycle 10: (11, 6, 2, 12, 14, 10, 4, 15, 0, 13, 17, 11)
- Cycle 11: (11, 6, 2, 0, 15, 4, 10, 11, 17, 16, 1, 5, 7, 3, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, 9, (1, 13), 5>
- <5, 7, (17, 16), 1, 5>
- <10, 4, (8, 18), 10>
- <11, 17, (13, 5), 7, 11>
- <2, (6, 11), 17, 13, 0, 2>
- <2, (6, 0), 15, 4, 10, 11, 6>
- <2, (6, 0), 15, 4, (8, 18), 10, 11, 6>
- <2, (6, 0), 15, 4, 10, (14, 12), 2, 6>
- <11, 6, 2, (12, 14), 10, 4, 15, 0, 6, 11>
- <11, 6, 2, 12, 14, 10, 4, 15, (0, 13), 17, 11>
- <11, 6, 2, (0, 15), 4, 10, 11, 17, 16, 1, 5, 7, 3, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
