Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are two cycles of length 4:
    - Cycle 1: 5-9-4-1-5
    - Cycle 2: 5-8-2-4-5

Step 2:
- Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
    - Cycle 1 (5-9-4-1-5) has a chord (9, 1): <1, (9, 1), 4>
    - Cycle 2 (5-8-2-4-5) has a chord (2, 8): <2, (2, 8), 5>

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are <1, (9, 1), 4> and <2, (2, 8), 5>.
