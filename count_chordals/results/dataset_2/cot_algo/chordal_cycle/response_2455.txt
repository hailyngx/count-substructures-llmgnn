Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 4, 6, 3, 0>
2. <0, 1, 4, 6, 5, 0>
3. <0, 3, 4, 6, 5, 0>
4. <2, 3, 4, 9, 2>
5. <2, 3, 6, 9, 2>
6. <2, 5, 6, 8, 0, 2>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <0, 1, 4, 6, 3, 0> has chord (1, 6)
2. <0, 1, 4, 6, 5, 0> has chord (1, 5)
3. <0, 3, 4, 6, 5, 0> has chord (3, 5)
4. <2, 3, 4, 9, 2> has chord (3, 9)
5. <2, 3, 6, 9, 2> has chord (3, 9)
6. <2, 5, 6, 8, 0, 2> has chord (5, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Thus, the final answer is [6].
