Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 19) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (2, 13) (18, 10) (18, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 9) (8, 11) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 7) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 7) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 18) (12, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 9) (4, 13) (4, 9) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 4) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Here are the cycles of length 4 in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 11 - 16 - 6 - 10 - 11
- Cycle 2: 3 - 15 - 12 - 18 - 3
- Cycle 3: 14 - 17 - 10 - 6 - 14
- Cycle 4: 1 - 15 - 12 - 18 - 1
- Cycle 5: 13 - 2 - 5 - 0 - 13
- Cycle 6: 8 - 15 - 12 - 6 - 8
- Cycle 7: 19 - 14 - 17 - 10 - 19
- Cycle 8: 7 - 3 - 15 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 9: 4 - 13 - 9 - 7 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Out of the cycles listed above, the following chordal 4-cycles are found:
1. <1, (15, 18), 3>
2. <2, (5, 0), 13>
3. <3, (15, 12), 18>
4. <4, (9, 7), 13>
5. <6, (10, 12), 16>
6. <7, (15, 1), 3>
7. <8, (15, 12), 6>
8. <9, (13, 7), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
