Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 14) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 1-3-7-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-12-14-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-14-4-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-4-14-1
- Cycle 5: 3-7-0-4-3
- Cycle 6: 3-12-2-5-3
- Cycle 7: 3-14-9-1-3
- Cycle 8: 10-11-6-5-10
- Cycle 9: 10-11-13-1-10
- Cycle 10: 4-9-12-2-4
- Cycle 11: 4-9-14-5-4
- Cycle 12: 8-7-0-4-8
- Cycle 13: 8-14-5-2-8
- Cycle 14: 7-3-1-9-7
- Cycle 15: 7-8-10-2-7
- Cycle 16: 12-3-1-9-12
- Cycle 17: 12-2-10-8-12
- Cycle 18: 2-5-14-9-2
- Cycle 19: 5-6-11-13-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycles:
  - <1, (13, 4), 9)>
  - <3, (12, 2), 5)>
  - <4, (9, 12), 2)>
  - <5, (6, 11), 10)>
  - <7, (8, 2), 10)>
  - <8, (14, 5), 2)>
  - <9, (1, 13), 11)>
  - <10, (11, 13), 1)>
  - <12, (2, 10), 8)>
  - <14, (4, 9), 5)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 19 cycles listed, and 10 of them are chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 19 - 10 = 9.

Final answer: [9]
