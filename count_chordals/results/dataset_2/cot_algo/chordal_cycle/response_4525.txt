Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 26) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 11) (12, 27) (12, 16) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 17) (26, 0) (26, 25) (26, 7) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 23) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (17, 22) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 7) (3, 2) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 8) (21, 18) (10, 1) (10, 7) (15, 19) (11, 27) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 29) (20, 21) (20, 8) (29, 23) (29, 14) (29, 4) (28, 0) (28, 19) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 16) (16, 12) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 5) (18, 9) (18, 21) (18, 6) (4, 22) (4, 11) (4, 29) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 25) (6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 26) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 6) (24, 0) (24, 25) (8, 1) (8, 21) (8, 20) (8, 16) (8, 6) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 24) (13, 14) (5, 22) (5, 16) (14, 9) (14, 29) (14, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 27, 12, 16, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 27, 12, 16, 8, 1, 17, 22, 4, 11, 27, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 2, 3, 2, 16, 12, 27, 11, 4, 22, 17, 1, 10, 7, 26, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 2, 16, 5, 22, 4, 11, 27, 12, 26, 7, 17, 1, 10, 7, 26, 25, 24, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <0, 27, 12, 16, 8, 1, 17, 22, 4, 11, 27, 0> has exactly one chord: (12, 4)
- <0, 2, 3, 2, 16, 12, 27, 11, 4, 22, 17, 1, 10, 7, 26, 0> has no chords
- <0, 2, 16, 5, 22, 4, 11, 27, 12, 26, 7, 17, 1, 10, 7, 26, 25, 24, 0> has exactly one chord: (16, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, there is 1 chordless cycle.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
