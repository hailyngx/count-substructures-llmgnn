Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 12) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
         - The cycles in the graph are:
           1. (5, 11, 10, 1, 4)
           2. (1, 3, 2, 11, 13)
           3. (1, 3, 2, 14, 0)
           4. (0, 9, 12, 6, 8)
           5. (0, 1, 3, 10, 14)
           6. (0, 1, 4, 8, 10)
           7. (0, 14, 2, 13, 11)
           8. (8, 10, 2, 13, 6)
           9. (8, 12, 9, 4, 1)
           10. (10, 14, 0, 9, 12)
           11. (10, 11, 2, 3, 1)
           12. (12, 9, 4, 1, 7)
           13. (12, 6, 13, 11, 5)
           14. (14, 3, 1, 4, 9)
           15. (14, 2, 11, 13, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
         - The chordal 4-cycle found is: 
           <0, (9, 12), 6, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
         - There is 14 chordless 4-cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [14] as there are 14 chordless 4-cycles in the graph.
