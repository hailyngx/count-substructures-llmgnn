Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<6, 9, 4, 3>, <6, 9, 2, 1>, <6, 9, 7, 8>, <9, 4, 3, 8>, <9, 4, 0, 1>, <9, 4, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 8, 2>, <1, 3, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 9, 6>, <3, 4, 8, 1>, <3, 4, 0, 6>, <4, 8, 3, 1>, <4, 8, 2, 9>, <4, 8, 7, 5>, <8, 3, 1, 2>, <8, 3, 4, 9>, <8, 3, 6, 7>, <0, 4, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 9, 6>, <0, 4, 2, 1>, <2, 8, 4, 9>, <2, 8, 3, 1>, <2, 8, 7, 5>, <7, 8, 4, 9>, <7, 8, 3, 1>, <7, 8, 6, 9>, <5, 0, 4, 9>, <5, 0, 1, 3>, <5, 0, 7, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<6, 9, 4, 3> - <6, 4>, <9, 2, 1> - <9, 1>, <9, 7, 8> - <9, 8>, <4, 3, 8, 1> - <4, 1>, <4, 8, 7, 5> - <4, 5>, <8, 3, 1, 2> - <8, 2>, <0, 4, 3, 6> - <0, 6>, <2, 8, 3, 1> - <2, 1>, <7, 8, 4, 9> - <7, 9>, <5, 0, 4, 9> - <5, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 10 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
