Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 12) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (4, 6, 10, 13)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 3, 8)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 1, 0)
- Cycle 4: (4, 0, 8, 13)
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 9, 13)
- Cycle 6: (4, 6, 5, 11)
- Cycle 7: (4, 7, 14, 1)
- Cycle 8: (7, 3, 13, 9)
- Cycle 9: (7, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 10: (7, 14, 5, 10)
- Cycle 11: (3, 8, 0, 13)
- Cycle 12: (3, 2, 5, 14)
- Cycle 13: (1, 0, 8, 13)
- Cycle 14: (1, 7, 9, 13)
- Cycle 15: (10, 6, 5, 11)
- Cycle 16: (10, 14, 7, 1)
- Cycle 17: (5, 2, 3, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <4, 6, 10, 13> (Chord: (6, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, 7, 3, 8> (Chord: (7, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, 7, 1, 0> (Chord: (7, 0))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 8, 0, 13> (Chord: (8, 0))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, 2, 5, 14> (Chord: (2, 5))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, 2, 3, 12> (Chord: (2, 3))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
