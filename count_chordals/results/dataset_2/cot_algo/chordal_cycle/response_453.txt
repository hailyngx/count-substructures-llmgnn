Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 8) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 16) (17, 0) (17, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (16, 0) (16, 15) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (6, 17) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (18, 13) (18, 10) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 6) (19, 13) (19, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 0) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<0, 7, 4, 14>
<0, 13, 5, 2>
<0, 13, 5, 2, 12>
<0, 13, 18, 10>
<0, 13, 18, 10, 9>
<0, 13, 18, 10, 15>
<0, 13, 19, 2>
<0, 16, 15, 10>
<0, 17, 6, 3>
<0, 17, 6, 3, 2>
<0, 17, 6, 3, 12>
<0, 8, 15, 10>
<0, 8, 15, 10, 18>
<0, 8, 15, 16>
<0, 8, 15, 16, 10>
<0, 8, 14, 2>
<0, 8, 14, 4>
<1, 7, 4, 14>
<1, 11, 9, 10>
<1, 11, 9, 10, 18>
<1, 11, 8, 0>
<3, 7, 4, 14>
<3, 7, 1, 11>
<3, 12, 2, 5>
<3, 12, 2, 19>
<3, 12, 2, 5, 13>
<3, 12, 6, 17>
<3, 6, 17, 0>
<3, 6, 17, 0, 13>
<4, 14, 8, 11>
<5, 13, 19, 2>
<6, 17, 0, 8>
<6, 17, 0, 13>
<7, 4, 14, 2>
<8, 14, 2, 5>
<8, 14, 4, 7>
<9, 10, 18, 13>
<9, 11, 1, 7>
<9, 11, 8, 0>
<10, 15, 8, 14>
<13, 5, 2, 14>
<13, 18, 10, 9, 11>
<13, 19, 2, 14>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

<0, 13, 5, 2> (Chord: (2, 5))
<0, 13, 18, 10> (Chord: (10, 18))
<0, 17, 6, 3> (Chord: (6, 3))
<0, 17, 6, 3, 2> (Chords: (6, 3) and (2, 5))
<0, 8, 15, 10> (Chord: (10, 15))
<1, 11, 9, 10> (Chord: (9, 11))
<3, 7, 1, 11> (Chord: (1, 11))
<3, 12, 2, 5, 13> (Chord: (5, 13))
<9, 11, 1, 7> (Chord: (1, 7))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 13 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final answer is [13].
