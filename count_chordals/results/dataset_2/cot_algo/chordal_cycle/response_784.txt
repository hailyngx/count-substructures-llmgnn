Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 4) (0, 29) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 3) (27, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 29) (9, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (17, 10) (17, 23) (17, 15) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 2) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 25) (15, 5) (20, 26) (28, 19) (29, 0) (29, 9) (29, 24) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 19) (24, 29) (24, 21) (24, 26) (24, 11) (19, 9) (19, 28) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 5) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 19) (26, 18) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 11) (22, 8) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 7) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 8) (11, 24) (11, 22) (11, 23) (11, 12) (23, 17) (23, 11) (23, 25) (25, 27) (25, 15) (25, 23) (25, 16) (25, 8) (7, 15) (7, 18) (16, 25) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 22) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 22) (2, 13) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 11) (12, 1) (13, 21) (13, 2) (8, 27) (8, 22) (8, 5) (8, 25) (3, 27) (3, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<0, 27, 25, 15>
<0, 27, 3, 6>
<0, 27, 8, 8>
<27, 25, 15, 5>
<27, 25, 23, 11>
<27, 25, 8, 8>
<3, 6, 1, 14>
<3, 6, 2, 2>
<6, 1, 14, 18>
<6, 2, 10, 17>
<9, 19, 26, 20>
<14, 1, 12, 11>
<17, 10, 2, 2>
<17, 10, 4, 4>
<17, 15, 25, 23>
<17, 15, 7, 18>
<19, 9, 29, 24>
<19, 28, 21, 24>
<25, 15, 7, 18>
<25, 8, 5, 19>
<27, 0, 4, 22>
<29, 0, 4, 22>
<29, 24, 21, 13>
<4, 0, 27, 25>
<4, 10, 2, 6>
<4, 22, 11, 12>
<5, 15, 25, 8>
<5, 19, 26, 18>
<8, 27, 0, 29>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

<0, 27, 25, 15>: (0, 25) - Chord: (27, 15)
<0, 27, 3, 6>: (0, 6) - Chord: (27, 3)
<27, 25, 15, 5>: (27, 15) - Chord: (25, 5)
<27, 25, 23, 11>: (27, 23) - Chord: (25, 11)
<3, 6, 1, 14>: (3, 1) - Chord: (6, 14)
<6, 1, 14, 18>: (6, 14) - Chord: (1, 18)
<6, 2, 10, 17>: (6, 10) - Chord: (2, 17)
<9, 19, 26, 20>: (9, 26) - Chord: (19, 20)
<14, 1, 12, 11>: (14, 12) - Chord: (1, 11)
<17, 15, 25, 23>: (17, 25) - Chord: (15, 23)
<19, 9, 29, 24>: (19, 29) - Chord: (9, 24)
<19, 28, 21, 24>: (19, 21) - Chord: (28, 24)
<25, 15, 7, 18>: (25, 7) - Chord: (15, 18)
<27, 0, 4, 22>: (27, 4) - Chord: (0, 22)
<29, 0, 4, 22>: (29, 4) - Chord: (0, 22)
<29, 24, 21, 13>: (29, 21) - Chord: (24, 13)
<4, 0, 27, 25>: (4, 27) - Chord: (0, 25)
<4, 10, 2, 6>: (4, 2) - Chord: (10, 6)
<4, 22, 11, 12>: (4, 11) - Chord: (22, 12)
<5, 15, 25, 8>: (5, 25) - Chord: (15, 8)
<8, 27, 0, 29>: (8, 0) - Chord: (27, 29)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 20 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
