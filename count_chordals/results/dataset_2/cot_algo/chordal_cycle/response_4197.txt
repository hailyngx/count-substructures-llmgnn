Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 3, 8, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 2, 1, 8, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 7, 1, 8, 9)
- Cycle 5: (2, 1, 7, 0, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 1, 4, 0, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, (9, 2), 8, 5> has a chord (9, 2)
- <5, (9, 3), 8, 5> has a chord (9, 3)
- <9, (2, 1), 8, 9> has a chord (2, 1)
- <9, (7, 1), 8, 9> has a chord (7, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

[0] (No chordless cycle found)

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
