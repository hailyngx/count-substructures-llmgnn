Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) 

Response:
Step 1:  
Possible cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-1-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-7-6-5
- Cycle 3: 5-4-6-1-5
- Cycle 4: 5-4-9-7-5
- Cycle 5: 5-3-9-7-5
- Cycle 6: 5-3-8-4-5
- Cycle 7: 9-3-8-6-9
- Cycle 8: 9-1-6-8-9
- Cycle 9: 1-6-4-8-1
- Cycle 10: 1-6-7-9-1
- Cycle 11: 4-8-6-1-4
- Cycle 12: 4-8-3-9-4
- Cycle 13: 8-6-7-1-8
- Cycle 14: 8-6-5-4-8

Step 2:  
Chordal 4-cycles found:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 6> (Chords: (9, 1))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 4, 6, 1> (Chords: (4, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 3, 8, 4> (Chords: (3, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, 8, 6, 7> (Chords: (8, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 4, 6, 7> (Chords: (4, 6))

Step 3:  
Total number of chordless cycles found: [9]
