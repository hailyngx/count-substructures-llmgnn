Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <2, (24, 18), 27>: Cycle 1 has a chord.
- <2, (21, 13), 29>: Cycle 2 has a chord.
- <2, (29, 24), 18>: Cycle 3 has a chord.
- <2, (29, 24), 18>: Cycle 4 has a chord.
- <2, (29, 21), 27>: Cycle 5 has a chord.
- <9, (7, 17), 11>: Cycle 6 has a chord.
- <15, (10, 17), 11>: Cycle 7 has a chord.
- <15, (10, 17), 11>: Cycle 8 has a chord.
- <17, (0, 7), 9>: Cycle 9 has a chord.
- <20, (11, 17), 10>: Cycle 10 has a chord.
- <20, (11, 17), 0>: Cycle 11 has a chord.
- <20, (11, 28), 12>: Cycle 12 has a chord.
- <20, (26, 8), 25>: Cycle 13 has a chord.
- <20, (26, 8), 25>: Cycle 14 has a chord.
- <20, (23, 27), 16>: Cycle 15 has a chord.
- <20, (14, 23), 27>: Cycle 16 has a chord.
- <10, (15, 1), 5>: Cycle 17 has a chord.
- <10, (15, 1), 5>: Cycle 18 has a chord.
- <7, (0, 17), 10>: Cycle 19 has a chord.
- <7, (0, 17), 11>: Cycle 20 has a chord.
- <27, (18, 24), 29>: Cycle 21 has a chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 21 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [21].
