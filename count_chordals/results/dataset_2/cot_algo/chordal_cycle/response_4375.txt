Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 16) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 18) (7, 1) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 13) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 17) (16, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 17) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 5, 14)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 13, 7)
- Cycle 3: (3, 4, 6, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 9, 1, 6)
- Cycle 5: (15, 8, 9, 1)
- Cycle 6: (15, 13, 12, 10)
- Cycle 7: (1, 6, 4, 2)
- Cycle 8: (1, 9, 8, 15)
- Cycle 9: (1, 14, 5, 15)
- Cycle 10: (10, 11, 18, 4)
- Cycle 11: (11, 18, 4, 6)
- Cycle 12: (7, 1, 9, 8)
- Cycle 13: (7, 13, 12, 10)
- Cycle 14: (12, 10, 11, 18)
- Cycle 15: (4, 18, 11, 10)
- Cycle 16: (4, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 17: (18, 4, 6, 1)
- Cycle 18: (0, 14, 5, 15)
- Cycle 19: (0, 9, 8, 15)
- Cycle 20: (14, 5, 15, 3)
- Cycle 21: (8, 15, 16, 17)
- Cycle 22: (9, 8, 15, 3)
- Cycle 23: (9, 0, 14, 5)
- Cycle 24: (9, 3, 4, 6)
- Cycle 25: (19, 2, 4, 6)
- Cycle 26: (19, 16, 15, 3)
- Cycle 27: (16, 17, 6, 1)
- Cycle 28: (16, 0, 9, 8)
- Cycle 29: (16, 2, 4, 6)
- Cycle 30: (6, 17, 16, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <1, 6, 4, 2> has a chord (4, 2)
- <9, 8, 15, 3> has a chord (9, 3)
- <16, 17, 6, 1> has a chord (17, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [27]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, 6, 4, 2>
<9, 8, 15, 3>
<16, 17, 6, 1>
