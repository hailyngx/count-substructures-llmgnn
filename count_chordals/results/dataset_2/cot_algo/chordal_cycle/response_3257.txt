Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
        - There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.
        
Step 2:
        - Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
        
Step 3:
        - The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
