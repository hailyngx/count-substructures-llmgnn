Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 12) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 6) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-2-8-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-2-7-3-1
- Cycle 3: 1-9-12-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-2-13-1
- Cycle 5: 1-0-5-14-1
- Cycle 6: 1-0-4-6-1
- Cycle 7: 1-0-6-8-1
- Cycle 8: 1-0-4-13-1
- Cycle 9: 1-10-13-2-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Out of the cycles listed above, only Cycle 6: 1-0-4-6-1 has exactly one chord which is (0, 6). Therefore, there is one chordal 4-cycle in the graph.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1-0-4-6-1> with chord (0, 6).
