Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 17) (4, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 12) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 19) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 18) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 12) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 16) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (1, 7) (1, 19) (1, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <3, 15, 10, 19>
- <3, 15, 18, 9>
- <4, 0, 2, 7>
- <6, 15, 10, 19>
- <6, 15, 17, 16>
- <6, 17, 16, 1>
- <7, 2, 0, 4>
- <7, 2, 8, 14>
- <9, 8, 14, 13>
- <9, 18, 15, 10>
- <9, 18, 12, 2>
- <11, 9, 8, 14>
- <13, 3, 15, 18>
- <13, 14, 8, 0>
- <15, 10, 19, 1>
- <15, 17, 6, 14>
- <16, 1, 7, 2>
- <17, 6, 15, 10>
- <18, 9, 8, 14>
- <19, 5, 7, 2>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <3, 15, (10, 19), 1>

Step 3:
As there is one unique chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
