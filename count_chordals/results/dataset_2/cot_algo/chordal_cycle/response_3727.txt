Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-12-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-4-7-5
- Cycle 3: 5-7-4-9-5
- Cycle 4: 5-7-10-2-5
- Cycle 5: 9-6-12-13-9
- Cycle 6: 9-4-7-10-9
- Cycle 7: 9-7-5-13-9
- Cycle 8: 6-12-13-8-6
- Cycle 9: 4-9-11-8-4
- Cycle 10: 4-7-3-0-4
- Cycle 11: 7-10-2-11-7
- Cycle 12: 8-11-2-0-8
- Cycle 13: 8-0-1-14-8
- Cycle 14: 13-1-14-12-13
- Cycle 15: 13-12-6-9-13
- Cycle 16: 10-2-0-1-10
- Cycle 17: 3-0-1-14-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The following cycles have exactly one chord:
    - Cycle 1: 5-9-6-12-5 (<5, 12>)
    - Cycle 2: 5-9-4-7-5 (<5, 7>)
    - Cycle 3: 5-7-4-9-5 (<5, 4>)
    - Cycle 4: 5-7-10-2-5 (<5, 10>)
    - Cycle 9: 4-9-11-8-4 (<4, 11>)
    - Cycle 10: 4-7-3-0-4 (<4, 3>)
    - Cycle 11: 7-10-2-11-7 (<7, 2>)
    - Cycle 13: 8-0-1-14-8 (<8, 1>)
    - Cycle 15: 13-12-6-9-13 (<13, 6>)
    - Cycle 16: 10-2-0-1-10 (<10, 0>)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [10].
