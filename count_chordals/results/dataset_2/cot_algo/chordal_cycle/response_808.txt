Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle (14, 6, 10, 15) has a chord (6, 15).
- The cycle (14, 6, 9, 16) has a chord (6, 16).
- The cycle (1, 3, 16, 10) has a chord (3, 10).
- The cycle (1, 13, 12, 15) has a chord (13, 12).
- The cycle (6, 10, 15, 12) has a chord (10, 12).
- The cycle (4, 18, 19, 0) has a chord (18, 19).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 38

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [38].
