Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 2, 0)  
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 7, 0)  
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 7, 0)  
- Cycle 4: (0, 6, 3, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- By adding one chord to each cycle, we can find chordal 4-cycles.  
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (0, 4), 2, 0>  
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (0, 7), 3, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.  
- There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found.  

Thus, the final number is [2].  
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are <1, (0, 4), 2, 0> and <2, (0, 7), 3, 0>.
