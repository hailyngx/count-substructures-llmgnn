Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 0) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 29) (9, 15) (1, 11) (1, 21) (1, 6) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 18) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 13) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 13) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 2) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (7, 28) (7, 20) (19, 8) (19, 22) (8, 16) (8, 19) (8, 27) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 25) (6, 2) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 22) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 20) (22, 29) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 17) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 27) (17, 4) (23, 4) (23, 20) (23, 13) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 23) (14, 28) (14, 4) (14, 13) (27, 3) (27, 8) (27, 17) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 4) (24, 4) (24, 13) (24, 18) (4, 17) (4, 23) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 24) (29, 5) (29, 22) (29, 25) (2, 28) (2, 6) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 23) (13, 14) (13, 24) (18, 21) (18, 0) (18, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4: 
- (1, 11, 28, 2, 1)
- (1, 11, 28, 14, 4, 17, 6, 1)
- (1, 11, 28, 14, 13, 3, 15, 9, 1)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 <1, 11, 28, 2, 1> has no chords.
- Cycle 2 <1, 11, 28, 14, 4, 17, 6, 1> has 2 non-adjacent chords: (4, 6)
- Cycle 3 <1, 11, 28, 14, 13, 3, 15, 9, 1> has no chords.

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, 11, 28, 14, (4, 6), 17, 6, 1>
