Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 0-6-7-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-6-9-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-6-8-7-0
- Cycle 4: 1-0-6-9-1
- Cycle 5: 1-0-7-3-1
- Cycle 6: 1-0-6-7-1
- Cycle 7: 2-0-6-7-2
- Cycle 8: 2-0-7-3-2
- Cycle 9: 2-3-7-0-2
- Cycle 10: 2-3-5-1-2
- Cycle 11: 2-5-1-0-2
- Cycle 12: 3-2-0-6-3
- Cycle 13: 3-2-9-6-3
- Cycle 14: 3-7-0-1-3
- Cycle 15: 3-7-8-6-3
- Cycle 16: 4-3-7-0-4
- Cycle 17: 4-3-2-5-4
- Cycle 18: 4-5-1-0-4
- Cycle 19: 5-2-0-1-5
- Cycle 20: 5-2-9-6-5
- Cycle 21: 5-4-3-2-5
- Cycle 22: 6-0-1-5-6
- Cycle 23: 6-0-7-3-6
- Cycle 24: 6-9-2-3-6
- Cycle 25: 6-9-7-8-6
- Cycle 26: 6-8-7-3-6
- Cycle 27: 7-0-1-5-7
- Cycle 28: 7-3-2-9-7
- Cycle 29: 7-3-4-5-7
- Cycle 30: 7-8-6-0-7
- Cycle 31: 8-6-0-1-8
- Cycle 32: 8-6-9-7-8
- Cycle 33: 8-7-3-1-8
- Cycle 34: 8-5-2-9-8
- Cycle 35: 9-2-0-7-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, 0, (6, 9)>
- <2, 0, (6, 7)>
- <2, 0, (7, 3)>
- <3, 2, (9, 6)>
- <3, 7, (0, 1)>
- <5, 2, (1, 0)>
- <6, 0, (1, 5)>
- <6, 7, (3, 0)>
- <6, 9, (2, 3)>
- <7, 0, (1, 3)>
- <7, 3, (2, 9)>
- <7, 8, (6, 9)>
- <8, 6, (0, 1)>
- <8, 7, (3, 1)>
- <9, 7, (2, 5)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [15].
