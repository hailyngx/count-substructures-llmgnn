Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 8) (9, 14) (9, 16) (18, 14) (22, 26) (22, 24) (22, 3) (2, 13) (2, 20) (29, 17) (29, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 27) (23, 3) (23, 28) (0, 24) (0, 12) (0, 26) (20, 2) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 28) (26, 22) (26, 0) (26, 1) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 11) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 15) (28, 23) (28, 1) (28, 7) (28, 27) (7, 28) (7, 5) (25, 16) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 12) (16, 9) (16, 25) (16, 24) (16, 5) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 3) (12, 0) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 21) (14, 9) (14, 18) (3, 22) (3, 8) (3, 23) (3, 17) (3, 4) (24, 22) (24, 0) (24, 16) (24, 13) (24, 10) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 24) (13, 21) (21, 12) (21, 13) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 27) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 24) (10, 19) (5, 29) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 16) (27, 8) (27, 28) (27, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. Some of them include:
- Cycle 1: 3-4-12-10
- Cycle 2: 3-17-29-5
- Cycle 3: 3-17-11-15
- Cycle 4: 3-22-24-0
- Cycle 5: 4-11-15-6
- Cycle 6: 4-12-15-6
- Cycle 7: 4-12-0-24

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <3, 4, 10, 12> with non-adjacent chord (3, 10)

Step 3:
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
