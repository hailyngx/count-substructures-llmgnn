Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 15) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 14) (16, 10) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 13) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 5) (7, 2) (19, 17) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

Cycles of length 4: 
- (1, 2, 5, 12, 6, 9, 1)
- (1, 2, 11, 14, 9, 1)
- (1, 8, 3, 4, 0, 17, 15, 14, 9, 1)
- (5, 12, 6, 8, 1, 9, 14, 11, 2, 5)
- (3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 0, 4)
- (10, 8, 1, 9, 14, 15, 18, 13, 3, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <(1, 2, 5, 12), (6, 9)>
- <(1, 2, 11, 14), (9, 1)>
- <(1, 8, 3, 4), (0, 17)>
- <(1, 9, 14, 11), (2, 5)>
- <(3, 4, 11, 14), (15, 17)>
- <(1, 9, 14, 15), (18, 13)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [6]
