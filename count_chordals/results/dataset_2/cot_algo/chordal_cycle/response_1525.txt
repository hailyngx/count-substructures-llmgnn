Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (12, 7) (12, 8) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: (4, 7, 5, 1, 4)
2. Cycle 2: (4, 7, 5, 2, 4)
3. Cycle 3: (4, 7, 12, 8, 4)
4. Cycle 4: (4, 7, 12, 8, 0, 4)
5. Cycle 5: (4, 7, 5, 6, 4)
6. Cycle 6: (4, 7, 5, 6, 1, 4)
7. Cycle 7: (4, 7, 5, 6, 3, 4)
8. Cycle 8: (4, 7, 13, 6, 5, 4)
9. Cycle 9: (4, 0, 8, 12, 7, 4)
10. Cycle 10: (4, 0, 1, 5, 7, 4)
11. Cycle 11: (4, 0, 6, 5, 7, 4)
12. Cycle 12: (4, 0, 6, 13, 7, 4)
13. Cycle 13: (4, 2, 5, 7, 4)
14. Cycle 14: (4, 2, 5, 6, 4)
15. Cycle 15: (4, 2, 5, 1, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (5, 7), 4, 2>
2. <2, 5, (4, 7), 2>
3. <4, 7, (0, 12), 8>
4. <4, 7, 5, (6, 1)>
5. <4, 7, 5, (6, 3)>
6. <4, 7, 13, 6>
7. <4, 0, 8, (7, 12)>
8. <4, 0, 6, (5, 7)>
9. <4, 0, 6, 13>
10. <4, 2, (5, 7), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final answer is [10].
