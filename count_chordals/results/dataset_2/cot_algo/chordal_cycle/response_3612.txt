- Cycle 27: (14, 3, 5, 4, 9, 7, 12)
- Cycle 28: (10, 3, 11, 0, 9, 7, 12)

Step 2: 
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (6, 1, 8, 5, 4, 9) - has chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 2: (6, 11, 9, 4, 8, 7, 12) - has chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 3: (6, 10, 7, 13, 5, 0, 2) - has chord (7, 13)
- Cycle 4: (6, 14, 4, 8, 7, 12) - has chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 5: (9, 1, 8, 4, 5, 13, 7) - has chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 8: (4, 9, 11, 0, 2, 13, 5) - has chord (0, 13)
- Cycle 9: (4, 5, 13, 7, 12, 10, 6) - has chord (5, 10)
- Cycle 13: (5, 4, 9, 7, 13, 2, 0) - has chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 14: (5, 8, 7, 13, 2, 0, 11) - has chord (7, 2)
- Cycle 18: (7, 8, 4, 9, 7, 13, 2) - has chord (4, 13)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
[9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<1, (5, 8)>
<2, (7, 8)>
<3, (7, 13)>
<4, (4, 8)>
<5, (4, 7)>
<6, (0, 13)>
<7, (5, 10)>
<8, (7, 9)>
<9, (7, 2)>
