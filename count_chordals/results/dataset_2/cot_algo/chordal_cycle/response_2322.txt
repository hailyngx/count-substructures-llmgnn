Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 7-21-9-21
- Cycle 2: 7-21-9-21-7
- Cycle 3: 7-14-1-22
- Cycle 4: 7-14-1-22-15
- Cycle 5: 26-7-21-9
- Cycle 6: 26-7-21-9-21
- Cycle 7: 26-17-0-25
- Cycle 8: 26-17-0-25-13
- Cycle 9: 26-17-0-25-20
- Cycle 10: 26-17-0-25-20-11
- Cycle 11: 26-17-11-18
- Cycle 12: 26-17-11-18-29
- Cycle 13: 26-17-11-18-24
- Cycle 14: 26-17-11-18-29-19
- Cycle 15: 26-1-22-15
- Cycle 16: 26-1-22-15-28
- Cycle 17: 26-1-22-15-28-6

- Cycle 22: 26-0-25-13-24
- Cycle 23: 26-0-25-20
- Cycle 24: 26-0-25-20-11
- Cycle 25: 26-0-25-20-11-18
- Cycle 26: 26-0-2-27
- Cycle 27: 26-0-2-19
- Cycle 28: 26-0-2-19-23
- Cycle 29: 26-0-2-27-3
- Cycle 30: 12-28-6-24

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4 <7, 14, 1, 22> has exactly one chord (1, 15), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 5 <7, 14, 1, 22, 15> has exactly one chord (7, 22), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 8 <26, 17, 0, 25, 13> has exactly one chord (17, 25), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 10 <26, 17, 0, 25, 20, 11> has exactly one chord (17, 25), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 12 <26, 17, 11, 18, 29> has exactly one chord (17, 18), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 13 <26, 17, 11, 18, 24> has exactly one chord (17, 18), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 18 <26, 1, 22, 29, 18> has exactly one chord (1, 29), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 20 <26, 1, 22, 29, 19> has exactly one chord (1, 29), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 22 <26, 0, 25, 13, 24> has exactly one chord (0, 13), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 24 <26, 0, 25, 20, 11, 18> has exactly one chord (0, 25), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final result is [10].
