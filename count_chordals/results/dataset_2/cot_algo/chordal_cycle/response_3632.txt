Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (17, 6) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 11) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (5, 4) (5, 12) (0, 11) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 16) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 10) (1, 16) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 1) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 0) (14, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
   - Cycle 1: (6, 4, 16, 15, 19, 6)
   - Cycle 2: (9, 18, 4, 5, 12, 17, 11, 0, 11, 8, 16, 15, 19, 9)
   - Cycle 3: (8, 16, 15, 19, 6, 17, 11, 0, 11, 8)
   - Cycle 4: (13, 7, 9, 18, 4, 5, 12, 17, 11,13)
   - Cycle 5: (10, 17, 11, 0, 11, 8, 2, 12, 5, 4, 16, 10)
   - Cycle 6: (2, 12, 17, 11, 0, 11, 8)
   - Cycle 7: (5, 12, 17, 11, 0, 11, 8)
   - Cycle 8: (0, 11, 17, 12, 5, 4, 16, 15, 19, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
   - The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 1: (6, 4, 16, 15, 19, 6) with the chord (4, 19).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
   - The final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <<6, 4, 16, 15, 19, 6>, (4, 19)>>
