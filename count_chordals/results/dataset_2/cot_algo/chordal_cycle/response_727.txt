Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 5) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 1) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 14) (15, 12) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 8) (14, 15) (14, 19) (12, 15) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 8) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 3) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 16) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph

<6, 5, 7, 11, 5>  
<9, 6, 10, 2, 9>  
<9, 17, 3, 8, 9>  
<10, 2, 19, 14, 10>  
<10, 8, 7, 11, 10>  
<11, 7, 5, 6, 11>  
<5, 6, 10, 2, 5>  
<5, 7, 8, 16, 5>  
<4, 9, 17, 3, 4>  
<1, 18, 9, 6, 1>  
<1, 15, 2, 10, 1>  
<1, 13, 4, 9, 1>  
<2, 10, 8, 16, 2>  
<2, 19, 6, 10, 2>  
<18, 9, 4, 13, 18>  
<15, 1, 18, 9, 15>  
<15, 2, 10, 8, 15>  
<15, 14, 19, 6, 15>  
<0, 16, 8, 7, 0>  
<16, 8, 3, 17, 16>  
<16, 13, 4, 9, 16>  
<14, 19, 6, 5, 14>  
<12, 15, 2, 10, 12>  
<7, 11, 5, 6, 7>  
<7, 5, 11, 7>  
<17, 9, 4, 13, 17>  
<17, 3, 8, 16, 17>  
<3, 17, 9, 18, 3>  
<3, 19, 6, 5, 3>  
<19, 2, 10, 8, 19>  
<8, 10, 2, 15, 8>  
<8, 16, 0, 7, 8>  
<8, 7, 11, 5, 8>  
<13, 4, 9, 18, 13>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord

The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <6, 9, (6, 5), 4>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found  
We found 33 chordless cycles.  

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycle is [1].
