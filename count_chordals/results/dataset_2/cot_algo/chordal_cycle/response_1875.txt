Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 5-6-9-3-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-3-9-5
- Cycle 3: 5-7-0-2-5
- Cycle 4: 6-7-0-2-6
- Cycle 5: 9-6-7-0-9
- Cycle 6: 1-5-8-4-1
- Cycle 7: 3-9-2-0-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: 5-6-9-3-5 has chord <6, 3>.
- Cycle 2: 5-1-3-9-5 has chord <1, 9>.
- Cycle 3: 5-7-0-2-5 has chord <7, 2>.
- Cycle 4: 6-7-0-2-6 has chord <7, 2>.
- Cycle 5: 9-6-7-0-9 has chord <6, 0>.
- Cycle 6: 1-5-8-4-1 has chord <5, 4>.
- Cycle 7: 3-9-2-0-3 has chord <9, 0>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
