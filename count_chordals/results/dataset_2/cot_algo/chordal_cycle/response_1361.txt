Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 5) (6, 9) (6, 19) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 10) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 9) (17, 18) (12, 4) (12, 7) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 16) (14, 0) (14, 13) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 18) (19, 6) (19, 4) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 8) (2, 10) (2, 13) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 3-7-4-6
- Cycle 2: 3-15-1-0
- Cycle 3: 3-15-5-10
- Cycle 4: 3-9-6-19
- Cycle 5: 6-9-17-18
- Cycle 6: 6-19-4-10
- Cycle 7: 6-19-4-12
- Cycle 8: 4-7-12-18
- Cycle 9: 4-7-16-14
- Cycle 10: 7-3-15-1
- Cycle 11: 10-4-7-12
- Cycle 12: 10-5-15-3
- Cycle 13: 13-6-9-17
- Cycle 14: 13-14-16-7

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, 3, 5, 15> with chord (1, 15)
- <3, 7, 4, 6> with chord (3, 4)
- <6, 9, 17, 18> with chord (9, 18)
- <4, 12, 7, 16> with chord (12, 16)
- <4, 7, 12, 18> with chord (7, 18)
- <7, 4, 16, 14> with chord (4, 14)
- <10, 5, 15, 3> with chord (5, 15)
- <13, 6, 9, 17> with chord (6, 17)

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [7].
