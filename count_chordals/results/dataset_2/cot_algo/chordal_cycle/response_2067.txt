Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 2) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 11, 13)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 5, 2)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 12, 6)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 13, 11)
- Cycle 5: (7, 11, 13, 9)
- Cycle 6: (7, 14, 1, 6)
- Cycle 7: (8, 12, 6, 1)
- Cycle 8: (3, 11, 13, 2)
- Cycle 9: (3, 6, 1, 14)
- Cycle 10: (3, 9, 13, 2)
- Cycle 11: (11, 13, 9, 14)
- Cycle 12: (11, 2, 5, 7)
- Cycle 13: (5, 7, 4, 8)
- Cycle 14: (5, 0, 8, 12)
- Cycle 15: (13, 9, 4, 8)
- Cycle 16: (12, 8, 10, 14)
- Cycle 17: (1, 14, 10, 8)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (7, 13) - Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (7, 13), 4>
- Cycle 2 has one chord (7, 2) - Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (7, 2), 4>
- Cycle 3 has one chord (8, 6) - Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (8, 6), 4>
- Cycle 4 has one chord (9, 13) - Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (9, 13), 4>
- Cycle 5 has one chord (11, 9) - Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (11, 9), 7>
- Cycle 6 has one chord (14, 6) - Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (14, 6), 7>
- Cycle 7 has one chord (12, 6) - Chordal 4-cycle: <7, (12, 6), 8>
- Cycle 8 has one chord (11, 2) - Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (11, 2), 13>
- Cycle 9 has one chord (6, 14) - Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (6, 14), 3>
- Cycle 10 has one chord (9, 13) - Chordal 4-cycle: <10, (9, 13), 3>
- Cycle 11 has one chord (11, 9) - Chordal 4-cycle: <11, (11, 9), 13>
- Cycle 12 has one chord (7, 5) - Chordal 4-cycle: <12, (7, 5), 11>

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]
