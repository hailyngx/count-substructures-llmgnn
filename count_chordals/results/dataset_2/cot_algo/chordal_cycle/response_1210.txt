Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (27, 18) (27, 17) (27, 23) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 23) (3, 5) (3, 22) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 18) (29, 28) (29, 5) (26, 1) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 16) (17, 27) (17, 26) (17, 13) (5, 3) (5, 29) (5, 18) (5, 20) (13, 17) (13, 10) (7, 18) (11, 24) (11, 9) (11, 4) (23, 27) (23, 3) (23, 21) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 20) (12, 4) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 19) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 22) (19, 28) (19, 12) (22, 3) (22, 25) (22, 16) (8, 18) (24, 11) (24, 12) (20, 1) (20, 5) (20, 4) (15, 12) (15, 2) (14, 12) (14, 10) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (21, 26) (21, 23) (6, 3) (6, 25) (6, 10) (6, 2) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 2) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 8) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 9) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (1, 3, 5, 20)
- (1, 3, 5, 29)
- (1, 3, 22, 16)
- (1, 3, 22, 25)
- (1, 3, 23, 21)
- (1, 26, 17, 13)
- (1, 26, 17, 27)
- (1, 26, 21, 23)
- (1, 26, 21, 23)
- (3, 5, 20, 4)
- (3, 5, 29, 28)
- (3, 6, 25, 22)
- (4, 11, 24, 12)
- (4, 12, 19, 28)
- (5, 18, 28, 19)
- (17, 13, 10, 1)
- (17, 13, 10, 14)
- (17, 26, 21, 23)
- (18, 5, 3, 1)
- (18, 7, 11, 24)
- (18, 7, 12, 4)
- (18, 7, 12, 14)
- and more...

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 3, 5, 20> (chord: (5, 20))
- <1, 3, 5, 29> (chord: (5, 29))
- <1, 3, 22, 16> (chord: (3, 22))
- <1, 3, 22, 25> (chord: (22, 25))
- <1, 3, 23, 21> (chord: (3, 23))
- <1, 26, 17, 13> (chord: (17, 26))
- <1, 26, 21, 23> (chord: (21, 23))
- <3, 5, 29, 28> (chord: (5, 29))
- <3, 6, 25, 22> (chord: (6, 25))
- <4, 11, 24, 12> (chord: (11, 24))
- <4, 12, 19, 28> (chord: (12, 19))
- <5, 18, 28, 19> (chord: (18, 28))
- <17, 13, 10, 1> (chord: (13, 17))

Step 3:
There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
