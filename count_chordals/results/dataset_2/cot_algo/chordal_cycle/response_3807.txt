Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 2) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 13) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 1) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 9) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 16) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 2) (8, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 11) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 17) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 17) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 17) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 3 - 6 - 13 - 1 - 3
- Cycle 2: 5 - 13 - 12 - 5
- Cycle 3: 6 - 13 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 4: 18 - 7 - 0 - 14 - 18
- Cycle 5: 18 - 6 - 11 - 17 - 18

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, (6, 13)>
- <5, 12, (13, 5)>
- <6, 1, (13, 6)>
- <7, 14, (0, 18)>
- <6, 11, (17, 18)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [5].
