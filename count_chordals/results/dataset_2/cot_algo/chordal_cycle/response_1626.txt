Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 10) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 6, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 8, 9, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 10, 0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 13, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 8, 4, 1, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 6, 12, 2, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 11, 7, 0, 1, 3)
- Cycle 8: (8, 14, 0, 1, 4, 8)
- Cycle 9: (13, 10, 0, 1, 13)
- Cycle 10: (13, 5, 6, 3, 13)
- Cycle 11: (4, 10, 0, 1, 4)
- Cycle 12: (5, 10, 0, 1, 5)
- Cycle 13: (6, 12, 9, 1, 6)
- Cycle 14: (0, 7, 11, 3, 6, 0)
- Cycle 15: (0, 14, 8, 4, 10, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (4, 6), 3>
- <1, (4, 8), 9>
- <1, (4, 10), 0>
- <1, (5, 13), 2>
- <3, (6, 12), 2>
- <4, (8, 14), 0>
- <6, (3, 11), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 

There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
