Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 13) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more where every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 12, 10, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (2, 5, 9, 1, 8, 11, 2)
- Cycle 3: (7, 0, 1, 8, 14, 13, 7)
- Cycle 4: (3, 10, 12, 9, 1, 0, 3)
- Cycle 5: (4, 5, 6, 10, 4)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (5, 10)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord (5, 10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<2, (5, 8), 9>
