Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are four cycles of length 4 in the graph: 
1. Cycle 1: 0 - 9 - 6 - 1 - 0
2. Cycle 2: 0 - 9 - 6 - 4 - 0
3. Cycle 3: 0 - 9 - 4 - 8 - 0
4. Cycle 4: 0 - 6 - 1 - 8 - 0

Step 2:
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find that only Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (1, 8).

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 6, 1, (1, 8), 8>.
