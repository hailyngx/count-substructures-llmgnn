Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 4, 7, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 4, 7, 1>
- Cycle 3: <3, 6, 4, 3>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 9, 8, 1, 5>
- Cycle 6: <0, 4, 3, 6, 0>
- Cycle 7: <1, 8, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 8: <9, 8, 1, 3, 9>
- Cycle 9: <5, 1, 3, 9, 5>
- Cycle 10: <7, 8, 9, 7>
- Cycle 11: <0, 7, 8, 1, 0>
- Cycle 12: <3, 1, 8, 9, 3>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: <0, 6, 7, 4, 0> (chord: 6-7)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: <1, 3, 4, 7, 1> (chord: 3-4)
- Cycle 3 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 4 has one chord: <5, 9, 7, 4, 5> (chord: 9-4)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: <5, 9, 1, 8, 5> (chord: 9-1)
- Cycle 6 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 7 has one chord: <1, 8, 9, 7, 1> (chord: 8-9)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: <3, 9, 1, 8, 3> (chord: 9-1)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: <5, 1, 9, 3, 5> (chord: 1-9)
- Cycle 10 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 11 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 12 has one chord: <3, 1, 9, 8, 3> (chord: 1-9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 6, 7, 4, 0> (chord: 6-7)
<1, 3, 4, 7, 1> (chord: 3-4)
<5, 9, 7, 4, 5> (chord: 9-4)
<5, 9, 1, 8, 5> (chord: 9-1)
<1, 8, 9, 7, 1> (chord: 8-9)
<3, 1, 9, 8, 3> (chord: 1-9)
