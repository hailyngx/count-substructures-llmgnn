Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 1) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 10, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 13, 9)
- Cycle 3: (1, 8, 11, 7)
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 14, 2)
- Cycle 5: (1, 14, 0, 12)
- Cycle 6: (1, 14, 11, 4)
- Cycle 7: (2, 8, 11, 4)
- Cycle 8: (2, 8, 14, 0)
- Cycle 9: (2, 14, 0, 12)
- Cycle 10: (3, 4, 11, 7)
- Cycle 11: (3, 4, 12, 0)
- Cycle 12: (3, 5, 7, 11)
- Cycle 13: (3, 5, 12, 0)
- Cycle 14: (4, 9, 13, 6)
- Cycle 15: (4, 9, 10, 0)
- Cycle 16: (4, 11, 8, 2)
- Cycle 17: (4, 11, 14, 0)
- Cycle 18: (4, 12, 0, 14)
- Cycle 19: (4, 12, 2, 8)
- Cycle 20: (5, 7, 11, 8)
- Cycle 21: (5, 7, 8, 2)
- Cycle 22: (5, 12, 0, 14)
- Cycle 23: (5, 12, 2, 8)
- Cycle 24: (6, 9, 13, 10)
- Cycle 25: (6, 10, 0, 14)
- Cycle 26: (7, 11, 8, 14)
- Cycle 27: (10, 0, 12, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 6, 10, 0> (Chord: (6, 10))
- <1, 6, 13, 9> (Chord: (6, 13))
- <1, 8, 11, 7> (Chord: (8, 11))
- <1, 8, 14, 2> (Chord: (8, 14))
- <1, 14, 0, 12> (Chord: (14, 0))
- <1, 14, 11, 4> (Chord: (14, 11))
- <2, 8, 11, 4> (Chord: (8, 11))
- <2, 8, 14, 0> (Chord: (8, 14))
- <2, 14, 0, 12> (Chord: (14, 0))
- <3, 4, 11, 7> (Chord: (4, 11))
- <3, 5, 7, 11> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <3, 5, 12, 0> (Chord: (5, 12))
- <4, 9, 13, 6> (Chord: (9, 13))
- <4, 9, 10, 0> (Chord: (9, 10))
- <4, 11, 8, 2> (Chord: (8, 2))
- <4, 11, 14, 0> (Chord: (11, 14))
- <4, 12, 0, 14> (Chord: (12, 14))
- <5, 7, 11, 8> (Chord: (7, 8))
- <5, 12, 0, 14> (Chord: (12, 14))
- <6, 9, 13, 10> (Chord: (9, 13))
- <10, 0, 12, 2> (Chord: (0, 12))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 19 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final answer is [19].
