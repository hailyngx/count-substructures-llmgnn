Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (6, 5, 8, 0, 11, 9, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 14, 10, 8, 5, 6)
- Cycle 3: (9, 11, 7, 1, 2, 13, 6, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 8, 10, 2, 13, 11, 9)
- Cycle 5: (10, 14, 4, 1, 2, 10)
- Cycle 6: (11, 9, 3, 4, 1, 7, 11)
- Cycle 7: (14, 5, 8, 10, 4, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1: (6, 5, 8, 0, 11, 9, 6) <1, 3>
- Cycle 2: (6, 14, 10, 8, 5, 6) <2, 4>
- Cycle 3: (9, 11, 7, 1, 2, 13, 6, 9) <3, 5>
- Cycle 4: (9, 8, 10, 2, 13, 11, 9) <4, 6>
- Cycle 5: (10, 14, 4, 1, 2, 10) <5, 1>
- Cycle 6: (11, 9, 3, 4, 1, 7, 11) <6, 2>
- Cycle 7: (14, 5, 8, 10, 4, 14) <7, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are [7] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
