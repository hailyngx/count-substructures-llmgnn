Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 15) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 10) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (9, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 19) (17, 11) (17, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 10) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 19) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 3) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 18) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 19) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (4, 2, 1, 5, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 12, 6, 5, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 3, 13, 12, 4)
- Cycle 4: (8, 4, 12, 15, 8)
- Cycle 5: (8, 15, 1, 5, 8)
- Cycle 6: (15, 12, 6, 5, 15)
- Cycle 7: (15, 1, 2, 4, 15)
- Cycle 8: (1, 5, 6, 12, 1)
- Cycle 9: (6, 12, 13, 3, 6)
- Cycle 10: (12, 4, 8, 15, 12)
- Cycle 11: (0, 6, 5, 1, 0)
- Cycle 12: (0, 17, 11, 7, 0)
- Cycle 13: (10, 1, 15, 12, 10)
- Cycle 14: (10, 0, 6, 12, 10)
- Cycle 15: (18, 6, 12, 13, 18)
- Cycle 16: (19, 13, 3, 4, 19)
- Cycle 17: (19, 7, 15, 12, 19)
- Cycle 18: (3, 4, 8, 15, 3)
- Cycle 19: (2, 4, 3, 13, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, (2, 4), 5, 6, 12>
- <4, (8, 15), 12, 6, 5>
- <4, (12, 6), 5, 1, 2>
- <4, (3, 13), 12, 6, 5>
- <7, (15, 12), 6, 5, 1>
- <10, (0, 6), 12, 5, 1>
- <12, (13, 3), 4, 8, 15>
- <15, (7, 19), 12, 6, 5>
- <18, (12, 13), 3, 4, 6>
- <19, (15, 12), 6, 5, 7>
- <3, (8, 15), 4, 12, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 9 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [9].
