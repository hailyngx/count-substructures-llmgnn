Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 19) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 25) (11, 21) (8, 23) (8, 25) (8, 7) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 21) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 21) (6, 5) (6, 24) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 4) (9, 10) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 1) (22, 9) (22, 2) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 0) (13, 27) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 2) (26, 20) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 2) (1, 9) (1, 19) (24, 6) (2, 22) (2, 26) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 7) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 25) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 27) (0, 3) (0, 13) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 16) (21, 11) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 20) (25, 11) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 19) (12, 5) (12, 17) (16, 18) (16, 20) (27, 28) (27, 13) (27, 7) (17, 23) (17, 12) (17, 4) (4, 28) (4, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 3-15-19-1-3
- Cycle 2: 10-11-25-13-10
- Cycle 3: 8-23-26-2-8
- Cycle 4: 5-6-24-12-5
- Cycle 5: 9-10-11-25-9
- Cycle 6: 22-9-1-19-22
- Cycle 7: 13-5-21-23-13
- Cycle 8: 26-23-21-20-26
- Cycle 9: 14-3-0-13-14
- Cycle 10: 2-22-9-18-2
- Cycle 11: 7-3-0-13-7
- Cycle 12: 16-18-9-22-16
- Cycle 13: 27-28-4-17-27

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord) are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, (15, 19), 1, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <10, (11, 25), 13, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <8, (23, 26), 2, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (6, 24), 12, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (10, 11), 25, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <22, (9, 1), 19, 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <13, (5, 21), 23, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <26, (23, 21), 20, 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <14, (3, 0), 13, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <2, (22, 9), 18, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <7, (3, 0), 13, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <16, (18, 9), 22, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <27, (28, 4), 17, 27>

Step 3:
The total number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [13].
