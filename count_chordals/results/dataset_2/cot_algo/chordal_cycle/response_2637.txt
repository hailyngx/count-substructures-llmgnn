Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows (listed in the format of <node1, node2, node3, node4>):
<1, 7, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 1, 9>
<2, 4, 7, 1>
<3, 6, 9, 7>
<4, 7, 9, 1>
<5, 0, 4, 7>
<6, 3, 1, 9>
<9, 1, 7, 4>
<9, 6, 3, 1>

Step 2:
Next, we check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle <1, 7, 4, 8> has a chord between 4 and 1.
- The cycle <2, 3, 1, 9> has a chord between 3 and 9.
- The cycle <2, 4, 7, 1> has a chord between 4 and 1.
- The cycle <3, 6, 9, 7> has a chord between 6 and 7.
- The cycle <4, 7, 9, 1> has a chord between 7 and 9.
- The cycle <5, 0, 4, 7> has a chord between 0 and 4.
- The cycle <6, 3, 1, 9> has a chord between 3 and 9.
- The cycle <9, 1, 7, 4> has a chord between 1 and 7.
- The cycle <9, 6, 3, 1> has a chord between 6 and 1.

Step 3: 
The final count of chordal 4-cycles is [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 7, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 1, 9>
<3, 6, 9, 7>
<2, 4, 7, 1>
<4, 7, 9, 1>
<5, 0, 4, 7>
<9, 1, 7, 4>
<9, 6, 3, 1>
