Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <23, (8, 10), 9> with chord (8, 10)
- <43, (4, 8), 12> with chord (4, 8)
- <48, (13, 7), 0> with chord (13, 7)
- <52, (18, 3), 7> with chord (18, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 89 cycles in total.
- There are 4 cycles with exactly one chord.
- Hence, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [89 - 4] = [85].
