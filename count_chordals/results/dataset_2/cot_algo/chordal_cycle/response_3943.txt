Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 10) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 2-8-4-13-3-2
- Cycle 2: 2-8-4-3-11-2
- Cycle 3: 2-8-4-13-9-2
- Cycle 4: 2-8-4-13-7-2
- Cycle 5: 2-11-3-4-13-2
- Cycle 6: 2-11-3-7-14-2
- Cycle 7: 2-7-3-13-4-2
- Cycle 8: 2-7-3-11-5-2
- Cycle 9: 3-4-13-9-2-3
- Cycle 10: 3-4-13-7-2-3
- Cycle 11: 3-11-2-8-4-3
- Cycle 12: 3-11-2-5-12-3
- Cycle 13: 3-7-2-8-4-3
- Cycle 14: 3-7-14-11-2-3
- Cycle 15: 4-13-9-2-8-4
- Cycle 16: 4-13-7-2-8-4
- Cycle 17: 7-14-11-2-8-4
- Cycle 18: 2-9-13-4-3-2
- Cycle 19: 2-9-13-7-14-2
- Cycle 20: 5-11-3-7-2-5
- Cycle 21: 5-11-3-4-13-5
- Cycle 22: 5-12-9-13-4-5
- Cycle 23: 5-12-9-10-7-5
- Cycle 24: 10-9-13-4-3-10
- Cycle 25: 10-9-13-7-2-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal cycle 1: <2, 4, 13, 7>
- Chordal cycle 2: <2, 8, 4, 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- There are 23 chordless cycles in total.

Therefore, the answer is [23].
