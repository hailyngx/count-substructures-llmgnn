Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 8, 1, 3, 5)
- (5, 3, 1, 4, 5)
- (5, 0, 6, 7, 5)
- (5, 7, 9, 2, 5)
- (8, 1, 3, 4, 8)
- (8, 4, 2, 1, 8)
- (8, 2, 9, 7, 8)
- (8, 7, 6, 0, 8)
- (2, 9, 7, 6, 2)
- (2, 1, 3, 4, 2)
- (2, 4, 8, 5, 2)
- (2, 8, 0, 6, 2)
- (7, 6, 0, 5, 7)
- (7, 8, 5, 3, 7)
- (7, 2, 9, 0, 7)
- (7, 2, 1, 3, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, (8, 1), 3, 4>
- <5, (0, 6), 7, 9>
- <3, (1, 4), 5, 8>
- <8, (1, 4), 2, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

Putting it all together, there are [4] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
