Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 19) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (9, 8) (9, 13) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 8) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 18) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 18) (0, 5) (16, 17) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 18) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (2, 13) (2, 5) (14, 1) (14, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle: 1-3-11-19-1
2. Cycle: 1-3-4-11-1
3. Cycle: 1-3-13-11-1
4. Cycle: 1-3-11-15-10-18-12-5-2-13-17-1
5. Cycle: 1-19-11-3-4-11-13-17-1
6. Cycle: 1-19-11-13-17-16-17-1
7. Cycle: 1-19-11-15-10-18-12-5-2-13-17-1
8. Cycle: 1-19-18-12-5-2-13-17-1
9. Cycle: 1-19-18-15-10-18-12-5-2-13-17-1
10. Cycle: 3-13-17-16-17-1
11. Cycle: 3-1-19-11-15-10-18-12-5-2-13-17-3
12. Cycle: 3-1-19-18-12-5-2-13-17-3
13. Cycle: 3-11-13-17-16-17-1
14. Cycle: 3-11-15-10-18-12-5-2-13-17-3
15. Cycle: 3-4-11-13-17-16-17-3
16. Cycle: 13-17-16-17-1
17. Cycle: 13-11-15-10-18-12-5-2-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Among the above cycles, the following cycle has exactly one chord, which makes it a unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, (19, 11), 3, 4, 11, 13, 17, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]
