Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 18) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 4) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 11) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 12) (4, 3) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 15) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 19) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 7) (19, 14) (19, 18) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 2) (16, 9) (16, 3) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 1, 11, 14, 17, 15, 9, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 1, 11, 17, 15, 9, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 1, 18, 19, 14, 11, 9, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 1, 18, 8, 0, 13, 9, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 1, 18, 8, 0, 13, 7, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 5, 2, 15, 17, 14, 9, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 5, 11, 17, 15, 9, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 5, 11, 14, 17, 15, 9, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 9, 13, 7, 12, 10, 14, 17, 15, 9)
- Cycle 10: (6, 9, 13, 0, 8, 18, 19, 14, 11, 1, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 9, 13, 0, 8, 18, 19, 14, 17, 15, 9)
- Cycle 12: (6, 9, 15, 17, 14, 19, 18, 8, 0, 13, 9)

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (11, 17), 15>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [1]
