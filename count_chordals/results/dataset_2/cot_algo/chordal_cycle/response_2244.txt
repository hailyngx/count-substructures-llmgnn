Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 15) (13, 19) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 9) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 19) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 5) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 9) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph. By listing them out, we find the following cycles: 
- Cycle 1: 1-16-5-14-1
- Cycle 2: 1-10-6-4-1
- Cycle 3: 1-10-19-6-1
- Cycle 4: 1-7-12-18-1
- Cycle 5: 1-7-12-17-1
- Cycle 6: 1-16-5-3-1
- Cycle 7: 1-16-11-3-1
- Cycle 8: 1-16-5-14-2-1
- Cycle 9: 1-10-19-6-14-2-1
- Cycle 10: 1-7-12-17-18-1

Step 2:
We need to identify the cycles with exactly one chord. From the list above, we find that Cycle 4 (1-7-12-18-1) is the only cycle with exactly one chord (12, 18).

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 7, 12, 18, 1>.
