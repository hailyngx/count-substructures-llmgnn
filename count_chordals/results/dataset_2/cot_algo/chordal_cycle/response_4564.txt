        - Out of the 90 cycles listed above, only the following 7 cycles have exactly one chord:
            1. (5, 9, 18, 10) with chord (9, 20)
            2. (5, 9, 18, 20) with chord (9, 25)
            3. (15, 19, 26, 17) with chord (19, 1)
            4. (21, 14, 2, 22) with chord (14, 20)
            5. (21, 14, 16, 4) with chord (14, 20)
            6. (7, 15, 19, 26) with chord (15, 3)
            7. (22, 7, 3, 15) with chord (7, 29)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        
        The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [83].
