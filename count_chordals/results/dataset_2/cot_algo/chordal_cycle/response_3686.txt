Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 14) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 0) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (19, 11) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 18) (16, 13) (16, 1) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 17) (17, 15) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 7) (11, 19) (11, 6) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 2) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (18, 10) (9, 0) (9, 17) (9, 7) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (6, 12) (6, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle <5, 4, 12, 15, 1>
- Cycle <13, 16, 1, 14, 13>
- Cycle <1, 15, 17, 3, 1>
- Cycle <0, 1, 14, 13, 0>
- Cycle <5, 7, 17, 15, 12, 5>
- Cycle <5, 10, 0, 1, 16, 13>
- Cycle <4, 2, 7, 17, 15, 12, 4>
- Cycle <12, 6, 11, 19, 11, 6, 12>
- Cycle <0, 8, 3, 10, 0>
- Cycle <13, 5, 4, 2, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <13, 16, 1, 14, 13> with chord (1, 14)
- <0, 1, 14, 13, 0> with chord (0, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Final count: [2]
