Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 28) (16, 1) (9, 4) (9, 13) (26, 14) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 27) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (29, 3) (29, 10) (3, 26) (3, 29) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 6) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (27, 26) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 20) (0, 2) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 12) (20, 27) (20, 0) (21, 26) (21, 28) (21, 22) (28, 16) (28, 21) (28, 17) (28, 7) (28, 10) (17, 28) (7, 25) (7, 0) (7, 28) (7, 5) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 28) (10, 18) (14, 26) (14, 6) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 22) (22, 21) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 24) (24, 27) (24, 22) (19, 15) (19, 23) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 22) (6, 25) (6, 14) (18, 10) (18, 23) (18, 1) (23, 19) (23, 18) (23, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 11 - 5 - 2 - 0 - 11
- Cycle 2: 18 - 1 - 14 - 6 - 18
- Cycle 3: 22 - 5 - 2 - 4 - 22
- Cycle 4: 27 - 26 - 14 - 6 - 27
- Cycle 5: 15 - 10 - 29 - 3 - 15
- Cycle 6: 12 - 0 - 2 - 4 - 12
- Cycle 7: 13 - 9 - 4 - 2 - 13
- Cycle 8: 28 - 16 - 1 - 14 - 28
- Cycle 9: 25 - 3 - 26 - 14 - 25
- Cycle 10: 7 - 5 - 2 - 0 - 7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal cycle found:
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (18, 6), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 10 chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
