3. (27, 22, 5, 6, 27)
4. (27, 19, 18, 2, 27)
5. (12, 23, 0, 16, 12)
6. (12, 23, 22, 8, 12)
7. (12, 26, 16, 28, 12)
8. (12, 1, 18, 19, 12)
9. (8, 22, 23, 12, 8)
10. (8, 3, 26, 12, 8)
11. (2, 18, 19, 5, 2)
12. (2, 14, 24, 6, 2)
13. (2, 21, 4, 1, 2)
14. (18, 19, 29, 13, 18)
15. (5, 22, 23, 0, 5)
16. (5, 28, 16, 26, 5)
17. (5, 19, 29, 13, 5)
18. (6, 24, 14, 2, 6)
19. (0, 16, 26, 3, 0)
20. (14, 24, 6, 5, 14)
21. (24, 6, 5, 22, 24)
22. (16, 0, 23, 12, 16)
23. (16, 28, 17, 7, 16)
24. (19, 29, 13, 7, 19)
25. (25, 22, 8, 3, 25)
26. (25, 13, 7, 17, 25)
27. (25, 4, 21, 2, 25)

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <15, 21, 11, 2, 15>
2. <27, 23, 22, 12, 27>
3. <27, 22, 5, 19, 27>
4. <12, 23, 22, 8, 12>
5. <8, 26, 16, 12, 8>
6. <2, 21, 4, 1, 2>
7. <18, 19, 29, 13, 18>
8. <5, 19, 29, 13, 5>
9. <6, 24, 14, 2, 6>
10. <0, 16, 26, 3, 0>
11. <16, 28, 17, 7, 16>
