Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (5, 9, 6, 1)
- (5, 9, 6, 3)
- (5, 0, 4, 6)
- (5, 3, 6, 1)
- (9, 6, 1, 3)
- (6, 1, 4, 7)
- (6, 3, 1, 7)
- (6, 3, 7, 8)
- (6, 2, 3, 7)
- (6, 2, 4, 1)
- (1, 4, 0, 5)
- (1, 4, 6, 3)
- (1, 7, 3, 5)
- (3, 5, 0, 4)
- (3, 5, 9, 6)
- (3, 6, 9, 2)
- (3, 7, 1, 6)
- (4, 0, 5, 9)
- (4, 0, 2, 6)
- (4, 1, 6, 3)
- (7, 1, 6, 9)
- (7, 3, 6, 9)
- (7, 3, 2, 0)
- (8, 5, 9, 6)
- (8, 5, 0, 4)
- (8, 7, 1, 6)
- (2, 9, 5, 0)
- (2, 9, 3, 6)
- (2, 6, 1, 4)
- (2, 6, 4, 0)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <1, (4, 6), 3>
- <3, (5, 9), 6>
- <6, (1, 3), 7>
- <7, (1, 6), 9>
- <8, (5, 0), 4>
- <2, (9, 6), 3>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
