Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 15) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 19) (5, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 16) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 16) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 10) (9, 16) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 16) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1: 10 - 17 - 0 - 8 - 10
2. Cycle 2: 10 - 17 - 3 - 2 - 10
3. Cycle 3: 17 - 3 - 13 - 12 - 17
4. Cycle 4: 17 - 3 - 5 - 13 - 17
5. Cycle 5: 0 - 4 - 19 - 11 - 12 - 0
6. Cycle 6: 0 - 8 - 16 - 9 - 10 - 6 - 0
7. Cycle 7: 0 - 8 - 14 - 13 - 1 - 6 - 0
8. Cycle 8: 3 - 13 - 1 - 6 - 10 - 17 - 3
9. Cycle 9: 3 - 13 - 6 - 16 - 15 - 2 - 3
10. Cycle 10: 11 - 19 - 4 - 0 - 8 - 14 - 13 - 11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 3 <10, (12, 17), 3> has a chord (12, 17)
- Cycle 5 <0, (11, 4), 12> has a chord (11, 4)
- Cycle 6 <0, (9, 16), 8> has a chord (9, 16)
- Cycle 7 <0, (14, 1), 8> has a chord (14, 1)
- Cycle 8 <10, (6, 1), 17> has a chord (6, 1)
- Cycle 9 <3, (16, 2), 13> has a chord (16, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, we found 4 chordal 4-cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
