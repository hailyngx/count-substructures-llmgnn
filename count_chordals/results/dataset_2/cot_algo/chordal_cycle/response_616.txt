Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<1, 21, 11, 24>  
<1, 21, 11, 28>  
<1, 21, 11, 24, 7>  
<1, 21, 11, 28, 13>  
<1, 21, 11, 24, 27>  
<1, 21, 11, 24, 22>  
<1, 21, 11, 28, 25>  
<1, 21, 11, 24, 23>  
<1, 21, 11, 24, 22, 19>  
<1, 21, 11, 28, 13, 29>  
<1, 21, 11, 24, 22, 19, 15>  
<1, 21, 11, 28, 13, 29, 5>  
<1, 21, 11, 24, 22, 19, 8>  
<1, 21, 11, 28, 13, 29, 5, 23>  
<1, 21, 11, 24, 22, 19, 8, 2>  
<1, 21, 11, 24, 22, 19, 8, 2, 4>  
<1, 6, 7, 24>  
<1, 6, 7, 9>  
<1, 6, 7, 24, 11>  
<1, 6, 7, 24, 27>  
<1, 6, 7, 24, 22>  
<1, 6, 7, 24, 23>  
<1, 6, 7, 24, 22, 19>  
<1, 6, 7, 24, 11, 21>  
<1, 6, 7, 24, 27, 10>  
<1, 6, 7, 24, 22, 19, 15>  
<1, 6, 7, 24, 23, 5>  
<1, 6, 7, 24, 22, 19, 8>  
<1, 6, 7, 24, 23, 5, 13>  
<1, 6, 7, 24, 22, 19, 8, 2>  
<1, 6, 7, 24, 22, 19, 8, 2, 4>  

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <21, 11>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <11, 24>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <1, 24>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <1, 11>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <21, 24>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <1, 11>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <1, 24>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <11, 24>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <11, 21>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <21, 24>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <1, 24>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <1, 11>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <11, 24>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <21, 11>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <1, 24>  
<1, 21, 11, 24>  has one chord <21, 24>  

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:  
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
