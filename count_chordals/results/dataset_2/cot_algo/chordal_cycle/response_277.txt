Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 6, 8, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 1, 7, 9)
- Cycle 6: (6, 3, 8, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 8, 2, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 0, 4, 6)
- Cycle 9: (4, 3, 8, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 1, 7, 4)
- Cycle 11: (8, 0, 6, 8)
- Cycle 12: (8, 3, 7, 8)
- Cycle 13: (2, 8, 6, 2)
- Cycle 14: (0, 7, 9, 0)
- Cycle 15: (7, 1, 5, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5) - Chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 4, 5) - Chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 3: (5, 3, 4, 5) - Chord: (3, 4)
- Cycle 4: (9, 6, 8, 9) - Chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 5: (9, 1, 7, 9) - Chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 6: (6, 3, 8, 6) - Chord: (3, 8)
- No other cycles have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, 9, 6, 5>, chord: (9, 6)
<5, 1, 4, 5>, chord: (1, 4)
<5, 3, 4, 5>, chord: (3, 4)
<9, 6, 8, 9>, chord: (6, 8)
<9, 1, 7, 9>, chord: (1, 7)
<6, 3, 8, 6>, chord: (3, 8)
