Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 7-9-4-6-7 (Chordless)
        - Cycle 2: 8-5-1-9-8 (Chordless)
        - Cycle 3: 2-9-4-6-2 (Chordless)
        - Cycle 4: 1-4-6-3-1 (Chordless)
        - Cycle 5: 2-7-3-8-2 (Chordless)
        - Cycle 6: 0-9-4-6-0 (Chordless)
        - Cycle 7: 7-0-8-3-7 (Chordless)
        - Cycle 8: 5-1-4-6-5 (Chordless)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 1: 7-9-4-6-7 has 1 chord {9, 6}
        - Cycle 2: 8-5-1-9-8 has 1 chord {5, 1}
        - Cycle 3: 2-9-4-6-2 has 1 chord {9, 4}
        - Cycle 4: 1-4-6-3-1 has 1 chord {4, 3}
        - Cycle 5: 2-7-3-8-2 has 1 chord {7, 8}
        - Cycle 6: 0-9-4-6-0 has 1 chord {9, 4}
        - Cycle 7: 7-0-8-3-7 has 1 chord {0, 8}
        - Cycle 8: 5-1-4-6-5 has 1 chord {1, 4}

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <>
