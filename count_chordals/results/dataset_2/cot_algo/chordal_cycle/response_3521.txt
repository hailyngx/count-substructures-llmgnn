Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-4-1-0
- Cycle 2: 1-4-13-11-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-13-10-1

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-4-1-0 has a chord (4, 1) 
- Cycle 2: 1-4-13-11-1 has a chord (4, 11) 
- Cycle 3: 1-4-13-10-1 has a chord (4, 10) 

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<0, (4, 1), 5)>
<1, (4, 11), 13)>
<1, (4, 10), 13)>
