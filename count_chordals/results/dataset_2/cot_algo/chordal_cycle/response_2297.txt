Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (11, 12) (11, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (0, 8, 7, 4, 13)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 8, 7, 9, 13)
        - Cycle 3: (0, 8, 5, 14, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (0, 8, 5, 14, 12)
        - Cycle 5: (0, 8, 6, 10, 3)
        - Cycle 6: (0, 12, 7, 4, 13)
        - Cycle 7: (0, 12, 7, 9, 13)
        - Cycle 8: (0, 12, 5, 14, 1)
        - Cycle 9: (0, 12, 5, 14, 11)
        - Cycle 10: (0, 12, 10, 3, 13)
        - Cycle 11: (1, 14, 12, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 12: (1, 14, 12, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 13: (1, 14, 5, 8, 0)
        - Cycle 14: (1, 14, 5, 12, 7)
        - Cycle 15: (1, 14, 11, 12, 7)
        - Cycle 16: (1, 5, 8, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 17: (1, 5, 8, 9, 7)
        - Cycle 18: (1, 5, 12, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 19: (1, 5, 12, 10, 3)
        - Cycle 20: (2, 5, 12, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 21: (2, 5, 12, 10, 3)
        - Cycle 22: (2, 6, 8, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 23: (2, 6, 8, 5, 14)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, (14, 5), 8, 7, 4>  (Chord - (14, 5))
        - <2, 5, (12, 7), 4>  (Chord - (12, 7))
        - <2, 6, 8, (7, 4)>  (Chord - (7, 4))
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [3]
