Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 18) (4, 0) (4, 16) (8, 15) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 7) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 3) (19, 13) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 0) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 0) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 7) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 0) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 6) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 1) (12, 15) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Possible cycles:
- (5, 9, 3, 19)
- (14, 2, 7, 18)
- (4, 0, 13, 19)
- (8, 15, 11, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, (3, 19), 9>
- <14, (7, 18), 2>
- <4, (0, 13), 16>
- <8, (15, 11), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [4].
