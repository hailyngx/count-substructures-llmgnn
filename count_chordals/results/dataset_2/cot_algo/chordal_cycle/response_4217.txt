Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
<5, 8, 4, 3, 5>
<5, 6, 8, 3, 5>
<5, 7, 2, 1, 5>
<9, 2, 8, 3, 9>
<9, 2, 8, 6, 9>
<9, 3, 4, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 2, 6, 4>
<4, 8, 6, 7, 4>
<8, 5, 6, 7, 8>
<8, 6, 7, 2, 8>
<6, 5, 8, 2, 6>
<2, 9, 3, 4, 2>
<2, 9, 1, 7, 2>
<2, 8, 6, 5, 2>
<2, 8, 3, 4, 2>
<1, 9, 3, 4, 1>
<1, 9, 2, 7, 1>
<1, 2, 8, 6, 1>
<3, 5, 8, 4, 3>
<3, 4, 8, 6, 3>
<3, 8, 6, 7, 3>
<7, 5, 8, 6, 7>
<0, 9, 2, 1, 0>
<0, 9, 4, 8, 0>
<0, 4, 8, 6, 0>
<0, 2, 8, 6, 0>
<0, 1, 2, 9, 0>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 8, 4, 3, 5> has a chord: (8, 4)
- <5, 6, 8, 3, 5> has a chord: (6, 8)
- <5, 7, 2, 1, 5> has a chord: (7, 2)
- <9, 2, 8, 3, 9> has a chord: (2, 3)
- <9, 2, 8, 6, 9> has a chord: (2, 8)
- <9, 3, 4, 8, 9> has a chord: (3, 4)
- <4, 8, 2, 6, 4> has a chord: (8, 2)
- <4, 8, 6, 7, 4> has a chord: (8, 6)
- <8, 5, 6, 7, 8> is chordless
- <8, 6, 7, 2, 8> is chordless
- <6, 5, 8, 2, 6> is chordless
- <2, 9, 3, 4, 2> has a chord: (9, 3)
- <2, 9, 1, 7, 2> has a chord: (9, 7)
- <2, 8, 6, 5, 2> has a chord: (8, 6)
- <2, 8, 3, 4, 2> has a chord: (8, 4)
- <1, 9, 3, 4, 1> has a chord: (9, 4)
- <1, 9, 2, 7, 1> has a chord: (9, 2)
- <3, 5, 8, 4, 3> has a chord: (5, 8)
- <3, 4, 8, 6, 3> is chordless
- <3, 8, 6, 7, 3> is chordless
- <7, 5, 8, 6, 7> is chordless
- <0, 9, 2, 1, 0> has a chord: (9, 2)
- <0, 9, 4, 8, 0> has a chord: (9, 8)
- <0, 4, 8, 6, 0> has a chord: (4, 8)
- <0, 2, 8, 6, 0> has a chord: (2, 8)
- <0, 1, 2, 9, 0> has a chord: (1, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <8, 5, 6, 7, 8>
