Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 7) (14, 3) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 8) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 13) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 4) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 10) (0, 8) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 13) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 2) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 19) (18, 1) (18, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (7, 16, 4, 15, 7)
- Cycle 2: (12, 7, 9, 4, 12)
- Cycle 3: (6, 5, 19, 12, 6)
- Cycle 4: (2, 6, 5, 19, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 4, 15, 1, 2)
- Cycle 6: (5, 3, 19, 13, 5)
- Cycle 7: (10, 18, 1, 6, 10)
- Cycle 8: (10, 13, 19, 5, 14, 3, 10)
- Cycle 9: (16, 4, 2, 6, 16)
- Cycle 10: (16, 7, 9, 4, 16)
- Cycle 11: (11, 16, 7, 12, 11)
- Cycle 12: (11, 13, 19, 5, 11)
- Cycle 13: (8, 17, 16, 4, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 0, 10, 18, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle with the chord (4, 15).
- Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle with the chord (3, 5).
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle with the chord (5, 14).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
- As there are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <7, 16, 4, 15> with the chord (4, 15)
2. <5, 3, 19, 13> with the chord (3, 5)
3. <6, 5, 19, 13> with the chord (5, 14)
