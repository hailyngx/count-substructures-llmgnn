Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 17) (1, 3) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 19) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 18) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 19) (19, 9) (19, 6) (19, 2) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 18) (18, 16) (18, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (3, 7, 11, 4, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 14, 16, 4, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 8, 10, 0, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 3, 7, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 1, 3, 14, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 14, 16, 12, 8, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 7, 11, 2, 13, 5, 6, 12, 16, 4, 11, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 14, 16, 12, 6, 19, 2, 11, 4, 16, 14, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 8, 10, 0, 4, 9, 19, 6, 15, 18, 16, 8, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 1, 3, 7, 11, 4, 16, 14, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: (3, 7, 11, 4, 3) has one chord (4,11)
- Cycle 2: (3, 14, 16, 4, 3) has one chord (4,16)
- Cycle 3: (3, 8, 10, 0, 3) has one chord (0,10)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 3, 7, 3) does not have a chord
- Cycle 5: (3, 1, 3, 14, 3) does not have a chord
- Cycle 6: (3, 14, 16, 12, 8, 3) does not have a chord
- Cycle 7: (3, 7, 11, 2, 13, 5, 6, 12, 16, 4, 11, 3) does not have a chord
- Cycle 8: (3, 14, 16, 12, 6, 19, 2, 11, 4, 16, 14, 3) has one chord (4,16)
- Cycle 9: (3, 8, 10, 0, 4, 9, 19, 6, 15, 18, 16, 8, 3) does not have a chord
- Cycle 10: (3, 1, 3, 7, 11, 4, 16, 14, 3) does not have a chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [5]

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (4, 11), 3)>
<2, (4, 16), 3)>
<3, (0, 10), 3)>
<4, 3, 1, 3, 7, 3)>
<5, 3, 1, 3, 14, 3)>
