Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (20, 7) (20, 13) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 28) (25, 2) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 27) (17, 4) (24, 26) (24, 28) (24, 29) (26, 10) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 0) (15, 5) (15, 26) (16, 9) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 12) (23, 12) (8, 25) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 20) (13, 17) (1, 6) (1, 18) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 22) (22, 5) (22, 4) (22, 21) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 25) (3, 17) (3, 0) (7, 20) (7, 8) (29, 25) (29, 10) (29, 24) (14, 8) (14, 21) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 23) (21, 22) (21, 14) (21, 27) (27, 17) (27, 21) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 28) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 18) (11, 6) (11, 26) (11, 8) (11, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. (5, 9, 16, 26, 0, 6, 1, 18, 5) - 8-cycle
2. (25, 2, 5, 22, 4, 10, 17, 13, 20, 7, 8, 25) - 12-cycle
3. (25, 2, 5, 18, 1, 6, 0, 3, 17, 10, 26, 15, 5, 25) - 14-cycle
4. (10, 17, 3, 0, 6, 1, 18, 11, 26, 24, 29, 25, 10) - 12-cycle
5. (19, 9, 5, 22, 21, 14, 8, 7, 20, 13, 17, 4, 10, 19) - 14-cycle

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

1. <1, (5, 16), 26, 6, 0, 9, 18, 5> - Chords: (5, 16)
2. <2, 5, 22, 4, 10, 17, 13, 20, 7, 8, 25> - No chord
3. <5, 25, 2, 18, 1, 6, 0, 3, 17, 10, 26, 15> - No chord
4. <3, 17, 0, 6, 1, 18, 11, 26, 24, (25, 29), 10> - Chords: (25, 29)
5. <9, 5, 22, 21, 14, 8, 7, 20, 13, 17, 4, 10> - No chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]
