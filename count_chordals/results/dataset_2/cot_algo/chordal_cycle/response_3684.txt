Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 21) (5, 3) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 20) (17, 10) (17, 18) (17, 11) (2, 27) (2, 3) (2, 28) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 20) (18, 29) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 24) (12, 25) (0, 6) (0, 13) (14, 23) (14, 15) (8, 21) (16, 1) (16, 13) (19, 7) (19, 22) (19, 27) (19, 23) (22, 19) (22, 24) (22, 25) (26, 10) (26, 29) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 13) (1, 16) (1, 11) (1, 13) (11, 17) (11, 1) (20, 10) (20, 18) (20, 23) (21, 5) (21, 8) (21, 29) (29, 18) (29, 26) (29, 21) (29, 25) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 24) (24, 12) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 4) (25, 12) (25, 22) (25, 29) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 20) (4, 6) (4, 24) (4, 28) (28, 2) (28, 4) (28, 27) (27, 5) (27, 2) (27, 19) (27, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles with 4 or more vertices:
        - <5, 9, 3, 2, 27>
        - <5, 9, 6, 0, 13>
        - <5, 9, 6, 4, 28>
        - <10, 17, 18, 15, 14>
        - <12, 7, 19, 23, 14>
        - <12, 7, 19, 23, 20>
        - <12, 7, 19, 27, 28>
        - <17, 18, 20, 23, 19>
        - <17, 18, 20, 23, 14>
        - <19, 7, 12, 24, 4>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - <5, 9, (3), 2, 27>
        - <5, 9, (6), 0, 13>
        - <5, 9, (6), 4, 28>
        - <10, 17, 18, (15), 14>
        - <12, 7, 19, (23), 14>
        - <12, 7, 19, (23), 20>
        - <12, 7, 19, (27), 28>
        - <17, 18, 20, (23), 19>
        - <17, 18, 20, (23), 14>
        - <19, 7, 12, (24), 4>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are [0] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
