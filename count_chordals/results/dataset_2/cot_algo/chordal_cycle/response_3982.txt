Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 17) (9, 2) (9, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 14) (15, 16) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 16) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (18, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 6) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 2) (16, 15) (16, 12) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 13) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-8-14-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-17-5-12-7-13-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-17-5-12-16-15-14-0
- Cycle 4: 1-0-4-17-5-12-7-13-1
- Cycle 5: 1-0-4-17-5-12-16-15-14-1

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has the unique chord (7, 12).
- Cycle 3 has the unique chord (15, 12).
- Cycle 4 has the unique chord (5, 4).
- Cycle 5 has the unique chord (14, 11).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of 5 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the answer is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 4, 17, 5, (7, 12), 12>
<0, 4, 17, 5, 12, (15, 16), 15>
<1, 0, 4, 17, 5, 12, (13, 7), 13>
<1, 0, 4, 17, 5, 12, 16, 15, (14, 11), 14>
