Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 29) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 7) (23, 20) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 1) (27, 9) (27, 13) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 7) (20, 22) (20, 23) (20, 12) (20, 0) (20, 19) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 28) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 18) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 18) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (29, 26) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 24) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 5) (7, 22) (7, 0) (7, 16) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 14) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 6) (10, 21) (10, 13) (6, 29) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 16) (13, 27) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 10) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 24) (24, 29) (24, 5) (24, 4) (14, 15) (18, 21) (18, 28) (18, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- Cycle 1: 9 - 26 - 29 - 24 - 5 - 3 - 28 - 21 - 10 - 13 - 27 - 9
- Cycle 2: 22 - 20 - 19 - 9 - 0 - 7 - 16 - 4 - 24 - 29 - 1 - 12 - 20
- Cycle 3: 0 - 22 - 20 - 19 - 9 - 11 - 17 - 12 - 1 - 29 - 24 - 4 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 4: 20 - 19 - 13 - 15 - 1 - 12 - 17 - 18 - 21 - 28 - 8 - 2 - 3 - 5 

Step 2: 
Among these cycles, only Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (22, 9).
So, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <22, 20, 19, 9> with chord (22, 9).

Step 3: 
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
