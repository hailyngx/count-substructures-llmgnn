Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 5) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 2) (9, 17) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 14) (1, 14) (1, 17) (7, 14) (7, 2) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 10) (19, 2) (19, 12) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 4) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: {11, 16, 2, 6}
- Cycle 2: {11, 16, 5, 4}
- Cycle 3: {11, 16, 13, 3}
- Cycle 4: {11, 14, 17, 1}
- Cycle 5: {11, 14, 0, 14}
- Cycle 6: {16, 2, 6, 10}
- Cycle 7: {16, 5, 4, 3}
- Cycle 8: {16, 13, 3, 13}
- Cycle 9: {14, 0, 11, 12}
- Cycle 10: {14, 17, 1, 14}
- Cycle 11: {17, 1, 14, 7}
- Cycle 12: {17, 12, 19, 2}
- Cycle 13: {2, 16, 13, 3}
- Cycle 14: {2, 6, 10, 13}
- Cycle 15: {2, 7, 14, 0}
- Cycle 16: {2, 8, 18, 5}
- Cycle 17: {8, 18, 5, 4}
- Cycle 18: {0, 11, 12, 17}
- Cycle 19: {1, 17, 14, 0}
- Cycle 20: {1, 14, 7, 2}
- Cycle 21: {7, 2, 16, 13}
- Cycle 22: {5, 16, 2, 6}
- Cycle 23: {5, 18, 8, 2}
- Cycle 24: {5, 4, 12, 17}
- Cycle 25: {5, 10, 6, 2}
- Cycle 26: {19, 2, 7, 14}
- Cycle 27: {19, 12, 17, 1}
- Cycle 28: {4, 3, 13, 10}
- Cycle 29: {4, 5, 18, 8}
- Cycle 30: {4, 12, 17, 14}
- Cycle 31: {4, 10, 6, 2}
- Cycle 32: {12, 11, 14, 0}
- Cycle 33: {12, 17, 1, 14}
- Cycle 34: {12, 19, 2, 6}
- Cycle 35: {12, 4, 3, 13}
- Cycle 36: {10, 6, 2, 16}
- Cycle 37: {10, 5, 4, 3}
- Cycle 38: {10, 13, 3, 4}
- Cycle 39: {18, 6, 2, 16}
- Cycle 40: {18, 5, 4, 3}
- Cycle 41: {18, 8, 2, 6}
- Cycle 42: {13, 16, 2, 6}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <6, (13, 3), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 41 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [41].
