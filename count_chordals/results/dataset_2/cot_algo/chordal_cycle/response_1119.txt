Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 1, 6, 9, 5, 8, 7, 0, 2, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 3: (7, 5, 8, 2, 6, 7)
- Cycle 4: (0, 9, 1, 6, 2, 0)
- Cycle 5: (3, 5, 7, 6, 2, 3)
- Cycle 6: (7, 5, 9, 3, 7)
- Cycle 7: (3, 9, 6, 1, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 6, 2, 8, 4)
- Cycle 9: (0, 9, 5, 8, 0)
- Cycle 10: (3, 2, 8, 5, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<1, (6, 9), 5>: Chord (6, 9)
<2, (1, 6), 5, (8, 7)>: Chords (1, 6) and (8, 7)
<3, (8, 5), 7>: Chord (8, 5)
<4, (1, 6), 9>: Chord (1, 6)
<5, (5, 7), 3>: Chord (5, 7)
<6, (5, 9), 3>: Chord (5, 9)
<7, (1, 6), 9>: Chord (1, 6)
<8, (6, 2), 4>: Chord (6, 2)
<9, (5, 8), 0>: Chord (5, 8)
<10, (5, 8), 3>: Chord (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless 4-cycles found.
Thus, we found only one chordal 4-cycle, so the final count is [1].
