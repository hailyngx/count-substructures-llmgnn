Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-8-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-1-6-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-8-2-5
- Cycle 4: 5-9-1-0-5
- Cycle 5: 5-7-4-2-5
- Cycle 6: 5-7-2-6-5
- Cycle 7: 5-7-4-0-5
- Cycle 8: 5-1-6-3-5
- Cycle 9: 5-1-0-4-5
- Cycle 10: 5-1-8-9-5
- Cycle 11: 5-1-0-6-5


Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has the chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 2 has the chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 3 has the chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 4 has the chord (1, 0)
- Cycle 5 has the chord (7, 2)
- Cycle 6 has the chord (7, 6)
- Cycle 7 has the chord (7, 4)
- Cycle 8 has the chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 9 has the chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 10 has the chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 11 has the chord (1, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are 0 chordless cycles found. 

Therefore, the final count is [0]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <5, 9, (1, 6), 5>
- <5, 9, (9, 2), 5>
- <5, 9, (1, 0), 5>
- <5, 7, (7, 2), 5>
- <5, 7, (7, 6), 5>
- <5, 7, (7, 4), 5>
- <5, 1, (1, 3), 5>
- <5, 1, (1, 4), 5>
- <5, 1, (1, 8), 5>
- <5, 1, (1, 6), 5>
