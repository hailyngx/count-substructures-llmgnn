Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 15) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 15) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 15) (4, 3) (4, 6) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 7) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 2) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 14) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 4) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 10) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Here are the cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
1. (0, 1, 17, 15)
2. (0, 1, 13, 2)
3. (0, 3, 10, 8)
4. (0, 3, 4, 6)
5. (1, 7, 19, 10)
6. (1, 13, 2, 18)
7. (2, 11, 14, 6)
8. (2, 13, 7, 1)
9. (2, 16, 9, 11)
10. (3, 0, 5, 15)
11. (4, 6, 14, 11)
12. (5, 15, 17, 1)
13. (7, 1, 17, 3)
14. (7, 8, 10, 19)
15. (7, 13, 6, 4)
16. (8, 10, 19, 7)
17. (9, 11, 2, 18)
18. (9, 16, 2, 13)
19. (10, 12, 8, 7)
20. (11, 2, 13, 6)
21. (11, 14, 6, 4)
22. (13, 2, 18, 9)
23. (13, 6, 4, 3)
24. (14, 6, 4, 3)
25. (15, 5, 0, 3)
26. (15, 14, 11, 9)
27. (17, 1, 0, 3)
28. (17, 3, 4, 6)

Step 2:
After checking the cycles, we can see that only <0, 1, 17, 15> has exactly one chord (3, 17). 

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
