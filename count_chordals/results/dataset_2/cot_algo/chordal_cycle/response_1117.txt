Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 17) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 16) (4, 2) (4, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 15) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 6) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 14) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 12) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (16, 18) (16, 13) (12, 10) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 5, 8, 6, 13, 0, 11, 17, 15, 19> with edges (1, 3), (3, 5), (5, 8), (8, 6), (6, 13), (13, 0), (0, 11), (11, 17), (17, 15), (15, 19), (19, 1).
- Cycle 2: <2, 18, 16, 13, 0, 11, 17> with edges (2, 18), (18, 16), (16, 13), (13, 0), (0, 11), (11, 17), (17, 2).
- Cycle 3: <4, 9, 2, 18, 16, 13, 6> with edges (4, 9), (9, 2), (2, 18), (18, 16), (16, 13), (13, 6), (6, 4).
- Cycle 4: <6, 8, 5, 3, 1, 7> with edges (6, 8), (8, 5), (5, 3), (3, 1), (1, 7), (7, 6).

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Only Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: Chord <3, 15>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the count is [1]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <1, 3, 5, 8, 6, 13, 0, 11, 17, 15, 19> with chord <3, 15>.
