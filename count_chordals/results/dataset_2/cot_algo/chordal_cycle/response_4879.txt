Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 10) (6, 12) (6, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 3 - 11 - 14 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 3 - 13 - 1 - 12 - 0
- Cycle 3: 1 - 13 - 7 - 4 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 4: 2 - 4 - 9 - 10 - 2
- Cycle 5: 2 - 4 - 7 - 12 - 2
- Cycle 6: 3 - 0 - 12 - 7 - 13 - 3
- Cycle 7: 3 - 11 - 2 - 4 - 3
- Cycle 8: 6 - 12 - 7 - 4 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 9: 9 - 10 - 14 - 11 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 10: 10 - 14 - 3 - 0 - 12 - 10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 4: 2 - 4 - 9 - 10 - 2 has one chord (9, 10)
- Cycle 5: 2 - 4 - 7 - 12 - 2 has one chord (4, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <2, (9, 10), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (4, 12), 7>
