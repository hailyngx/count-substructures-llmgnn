Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 0, 6, 4)
- Cycle 3: (7, 1, 2, 8, 7)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 5, 7, 1, 9)
- Cycle 6: (6, 0, 8, 2, 6)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (4, 5)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (0, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: None
