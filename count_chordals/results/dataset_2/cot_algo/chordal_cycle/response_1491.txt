Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-2-0-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-2-7-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-4-8-1
- Cycle 4: 1-5-4-9-1
- Cycle 5: 1-5-4-3-1
- Cycle 6: 1-4-9-8-1
- Cycle 7: 2-5-4-9-2
- Cycle 8: 2-5-4-3-2
- Cycle 9: 2-5-4-1-2
- Cycle 10: 2-0-6-8-2
- Cycle 11: 2-0-6-3-2
- Cycle 12: 2-7-8-4-2

Step 2:  
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3 (<1, 5, 4, 8, 1>): Chord - (5, 8)
- Cycle 6 (<1, 4, 9, 8, 1>): Chord - (4, 9)
- Cycle 7 (<2, 5, 4, 9, 2>): Chord - (5, 4)
- Cycle 8 (<2, 5, 4, 3, 2>): Chord - (5, 4)
- Cycle 9 (<2, 5, 4, 1, 2>): Chord - (5, 4)

Step 3:  
Number of chordless cycles found: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:  
<1, 5, 2, 0>
<1, 5, 4, 3>
<1, 4, 9, 8>
<2, 7, 8, 4>
<2, 5, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 4, 1>
<2, 0, 6, 8>
<2, 0, 6, 3>
<1, 5, 2, 7>
