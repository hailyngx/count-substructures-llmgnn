Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 22) (27, 18) (4, 7) (4, 25) (4, 11) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 22) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 29) (22, 27) (22, 7) (22, 18) (22, 23) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 5) (20, 25) (20, 10) (25, 4) (25, 20) (25, 8) (25, 0) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 6) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 26) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 21) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 29) (11, 4) (11, 3) (16, 17) (16, 21) (28, 3) (8, 14) (8, 25) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) (19, 14) (21, 27) (21, 26) (21, 16) (21, 12) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 10) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 18) (29, 3) (29, 24) (24, 29) (24, 12) (12, 21) (12, 24) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 23) (6, 0) (10, 7) (10, 20) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: {4, 7, 22, 27, 18}
- Cycle 2: {4, 7, 22, 23, 26, 1, 14, 2, 0}
- Cycle 3: {4, 7, 22, 23, 26, 1, 14, 17}
- Cycle 4: {4, 7, 22, 23, 6, 0, 2, 14}
- Cycle 5: {4, 7, 22, 23, 26, 1, 26, 21}
- Cycle 6: {4, 7, 22, 23, 26, 21, 27, 18}
- Cycle 7: {4, 11, 3, 29, 18}
- Cycle 8: {4, 11, 3, 29, 24, 12, 21, 27}
- Cycle 9: {4, 25, 20, 25}
- Cycle 10: {4, 25, 8, 9, 0, 2, 14}
- Cycle 11: {7, 22, 23, 26, 1, 14, 2, 13}
- Cycle 12: {7, 22, 23, 6, 0, 2, 14, 19}
- Cycle 13: {7, 22, 23, 26, 1, 26, 21, 27}
- Cycle 14: {7, 22, 23, 6, 0, 25, 8, 14}
- Cycle 15: {7, 22, 23, 26, 21, 16, 17, 5}
- Cycle 16: {18, 27, 21, 26, 1, 14, 2, 5}
- Cycle 17: {18, 27, 18}
- Cycle 18: {22, 7, 22}
- Cycle 19: {22, 23, 26, 1, 14, 8}
- Cycle 20: {22, 23, 26, 1, 14, 19}
- Cycle 21: {22, 23, 26, 1, 26, 21, 12}
- Cycle 22: {22, 23, 6, 0, 2, 14, 8}
- Cycle 23: {22, 23, 6, 0, 2, 14, 19}
- Cycle 24: {22, 23, 6, 0, 25, 8, 14}
- Cycle 25: {22, 23, 26, 1, 26, 21, 27}
- Cycle 26: {22, 23, 6, 0, 25, 8, 9}
- Cycle 27: {22, 23, 6, 0, 9, 8, 25}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

From the above cycles, we find that the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- <1, (0, 2), 14>
- <2, (0, 14), 19>
- <3, (11, 29), 18>
- <4, (7, 22), 23>
- <5, (16, 17), 5>
- <6, (21, 27), 18>
- <7, (22, 7), 22>
- <8, (23, 6), 0>
- <9, (25, 8), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
We have found 9 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [9].
