Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more
- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 9, 1) 
- Cycle 2: (5, 6, 3, 1) 
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 7, 3) 
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 2, 1) 
- Cycle 5: (5, 3, 6, 7) 
- Cycle 6: (5, 3, 1, 9) 
- Cycle 7: (5, 3, 7, 4) 
- Cycle 8: (6, 9, 1, 3) 
- Cycle 9: (6, 9, 8, 7) 
- Cycle 10: (6, 7, 3, 1) 
- Cycle 11: (6, 7, 4, 3) 
- Cycle 12: (9, 6, 7, 5) 
- Cycle 13: (9, 6, 5, 3) 
- Cycle 14: (9, 8, 7, 5) 
- Cycle 15: (9, 1, 3, 7) 
- Cycle 16: (1, 9, 8, 7) 
- Cycle 17: (1, 3, 7, 5) 
- Cycle 18: (3, 5, 7, 4) 
- Cycle 19: (3, 5, 6, 7) 
- Cycle 20: (3, 1, 9, 8) 
- Cycle 21: (3, 1, 2, 6) 
- Cycle 22: (4, 7, 3, 5) 
- Cycle 23: (4, 7, 8, 9) 

Step 2: Check for exactly one non-adjacent chord in each cycle
<1, (6, 1), 9> - Chord: (6, 1)
<2, (5, 1), 6> - Chord: (5, 1)
<3, (7, 6), 3> - Chord: (7, 6)
<4, (3, 5), 1> - Chord: (3, 5)
<5, (7, 4), 6> - Chord: (7, 4)
<6, (9, 1), 3> - Chord: (9, 1)
<7, (7, 5), 3> - Chord: (7, 5)
<8, (9, 6), 7> - Chord: (9, 6)
<9, (8, 9), 7> - Chord: (8, 9)
<10, (5, 6), 3> - Chord: (5, 6)
<11, (6, 3), 7> - Chord: (6, 3)
<12, (9, 7), 6> - Chord: (9, 7)
<13, (9, 8), 7> - Chord: (9, 8)
<14, (9, 1), 6> - Chord: (9, 1)
<15, (1, 7), 3> - Chord: (1, 7)
<16, (8, 9), 7> - Chord: (8, 9)
<17, (7, 4), 3> - Chord: (7, 4)
<18, (6, 3), 7> - Chord: (6, 3)
<19, (5, 6), 3> - Chord: (5, 6)
<20, (3, 2), 1> - Chord: (3, 2)
<21, (3, 5), 7> - Chord: (3, 5)
<22, (7, 4), 8> - Chord: (7, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found
There are 22 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [22].
