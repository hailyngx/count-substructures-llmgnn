Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle <0, 5, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle <1, 2, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle <1, 2, 9, 8, 1>
- Cycle <1, 7, 3, 8, 1>
- Cycle <2, 3, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle <3, 7, 4, 2, 3>
- Cycle <4, 7, 3, 8, 4>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 5, 1, 6, 0> has chord (5, 1)
- Cycle <1, 2, 4, 8, 1> has chord (2, 8)
- Cycle <1, 2, 9, 8, 1> has chord (2, 9)
- Cycle <1, 7, 3, 8, 1> has chord (7, 3)
- Cycle <2, 3, 7, 4, 2> has chord (3, 7)
- Cycle <3, 7, 4, 2, 3> has chord (7, 4)
- Cycle <4, 7, 3, 8, 4> has chord (7, 3)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, (5, 1), 6>
<1, (2, 8), 4>
<1, (2, 9), 8>
<1, (7, 3), 8>
<2, (3, 7), 4>
<3, (7, 4), 2>
<4, (7, 3), 8>
