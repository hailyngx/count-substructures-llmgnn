Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 19) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 2) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 6) (8, 3) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 19) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 11 - 16 - 17 - 1 - 15 - 11
- Cycle 2: 17 - 16 - 18 - 19 - 17
- Cycle 3: 15 - 1 - 10 - 3 - 15
- Cycle 4: 7 - 11 - 16 - 18 - 7
- Cycle 5: 5 - 9 - 18 - 19 - 5
- Cycle 6: 9 - 4 - 7 - 12 - 9
- Cycle 7: 13 - 17 - 16 - 18 - 13
- Cycle 8: 2 - 5 - 9 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 9: 13 - 5 - 0 - 19 - 13
- Cycle 10: 17 - 1 - 10 - 3 - 17

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (15, 11), 1>
- <2, (9, 5), 2>
- <3, (1, 10), 3>
- <4, (16, 18), 4>
- <5, (18, 9), 5>
- <6, (7, 12), 6>
- <7, (16, 18), 7>
- <8, (9, 4), 8>
- <9, (5, 19), 9>
- <10, (1, 10), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
