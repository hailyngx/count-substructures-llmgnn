Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 11) (13, 14) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 9, 12, 1, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 9, 14, 13, 11, 5, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 9, 12, 5, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 5, 12, 11, 13, 14, 9, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 3, 7, 1, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 3, 7, 14, 13, 11, 2, 5, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 0, 7, 1, 12, 11, 5, 8, 4)
- Cycle 8: (8, 5, 4, 9, 12, 11, 3, 10, 7, 0, 8)
- Cycle 9: (8, 5, 12, 11, 3, 7, 14, 9, 4, 0, 8)
- Cycle 10: (8, 5, 12, 1, 7, 14, 13, 11, 3, 4, 0, 8)
- Cycle 11: (8, 14, 13, 11, 12, 9, 10, 3, 7, 0, 4, 5, 8)
- Cycle 12: (7, 0, 4, 5, 12, 11, 13, 14, 9, 10, 3, 7)
- Cycle 13: (7, 0, 4, 9, 14, 13, 11, 12, 5, 2, 1, 6, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- None of the cycles listed above have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
