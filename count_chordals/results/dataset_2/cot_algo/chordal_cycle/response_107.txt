Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 0, 1, 2, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 0, 8, 1, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 3, 2, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 3, 2, 4)
- Cycle 5: (0, 1, 2, 3, 0)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chords (7, 1)
- Cycle 2 has chords (0, 8)
- Cycle 3 has chords (7, 2)
- Cycle 4 has chords (9, 3)
- Cycle 5 has chords (1, 2)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (7, 1), 4, 2>
- <2, (0, 8), 4, 7>
- <3, (7, 2), 4, 9>
- <4, (9, 3), 4, 7>
- <5, (1, 2), 3, 0>
