Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 17) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 24) (8, 2) (8, 5) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 23) (28, 21) (28, 22) (28, 27) (28, 13) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 22) (22, 28) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 25) (24, 2) (24, 27) (24, 23) (26, 20) (26, 3) (26, 12) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 27) (13, 28) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 29) (20, 2) (20, 26) (29, 0) (29, 1) (29, 15) (1, 29) (1, 6) (1, 25) (6, 1) (14, 13) (14, 23) (14, 19) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 14) (15, 29) (15, 16) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 5) (3, 26) (3, 18) (18, 11) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 16) (25, 22) (25, 1) (16, 15) (16, 18) (12, 26) (23, 21) (23, 24) (23, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 17, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 17, 10, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 2, 19, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 17, 10, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 4, 2, 7)
- Cycle 6: (10, 17, 9, 10)
- Cycle 7: (10, 19, 2, 10)
- Cycle 8: (11, 9, 17, 11)
- Cycle 9: (11, 18, 26, 11)
- Cycle 10: (17, 10, 19, 17)
- Cycle 11: (17, 9, 22, 17)
- Cycle 12: (17, 7, 4, 17)
- Cycle 13: (2, 19, 14, 2)
- Cycle 14: (2, 4, 7, 2)
- Cycle 15: (2, 8, 5, 2)
- Cycle 16: (8, 5, 27, 8)
- Cycle 17: (21, 28, 13, 21)
- Cycle 18: (21, 0, 7, 21)
- Cycle 19: (21, 27, 24, 21)
- Cycle 20: (28, 13, 14, 28)
- Cycle 21: (10, 17, 7, 10) - Cyclic but not chordal 4-cycle due to multiple chords (17, 10) and (10, 7).

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycles:
    - <1, (4, 2), 17>
    - <2, (4, 17), 10>
    - <3, (4, 19), 2>
    - <4, (7, 17), 10>
    - <5, (7, 4), 2>
    - <6, (10, 19), 2>
    - <7, (11, 9), 17>
    - <8, (11, 18), 26>
    - <9, (17, 9), 22>
    - <10, (17, 4), 7>
    - <11, (2, 19), 14>
    - <12, (2, 4), 7>
    - <13, (2, 8), 5>
    - <14, (8, 5), 27>
    - <15, (21, 28), 13>
    - <16, (21, 0), 7>
    - <17, (21, 27), 24>
    - <18, (28, 13), 14>

Step 3:
There are 18 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [18].
