Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 7) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 13) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 6 - 5 - 8
- Cycle 2: 5 - 6 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 3: 2 - 9 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 4: 2 - 13 - 14 - 10
- Cycle 5: 2 - 10 - 14 - 7
- Cycle 6: 3 - 6 - 13 - 14
- Cycle 7: 11 - 5 - 12 - 14
- Cycle 8: 11 - 3 - 2 - 9
- Cycle 9: 9 - 8 - 5 - 12
- Cycle 10: 12 - 5 - 11 - 1
- Cycle 11: 1 - 11 - 2 - 13
- Cycle 12: 1 - 12 - 14 - 7

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (5, 0)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (13, 10)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (10, 2)
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (6, 14)
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: (5, 14)
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord: (9, 12)
- Cycle 10 has exactly one chord: (5, 1)
- Cycle 11 has exactly one chord: (11, 2)
- Cycle 12 has exactly one chord: (14, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (4, 8), 6)>
<2, (5, 0), 3)>
<3, (9, 2), 8)>
<4, (13, 10), 14)>
<5, (10, 2), 7)>
<6, (6, 14), 13)>
<7, (5, 14), 11)>
<8, (3, 9), 2)>
<9, (9, 12), 5)>
<10, (5, 1), 11)>
<11, (11, 2), 13)>
<12, (14, 1), 7)>
