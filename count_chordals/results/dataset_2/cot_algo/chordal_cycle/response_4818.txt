Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (8, 5, 13, 1) with edges (8, 5), (5, 13), (13, 1), (1, 8)
- Cycle 2: (8, 4, 3, 10) with edges (8, 4), (4, 3), (3, 10), (10, 8)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 4, 6) with edges (1, 3), (3, 4), (4, 6), (6, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 6, 2) with edges (1, 3), (3, 6), (6, 2), (2, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 13, 7, 14) with edges (1, 13), (13, 7), (7, 14), (14, 1)
- Cycle 6: (4, 3, 1, 14) with edges (4, 3), (3, 1), (1, 14), (14, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 2, 6, 1) with edges (4, 2), (2, 6), (6, 1), (1, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 6, 3, 1) with edges (4, 6), (6, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has chords: (5, 1)
    Therefore, <8, (5, 1), 13> is a unique chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 has chords: (3, 1)
    Therefore, <3, (3, 1), 4> is a unique chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 7 has chords: (2, 1)
    Therefore, <4, (2, 1), 6> is a unique chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the final count of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
