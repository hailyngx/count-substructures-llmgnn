Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph with length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 7-5-3-4-7
- Cycle 2: 7-5-9-7
- Cycle 3: 7-4-3-0-7
- Cycle 4: 7-4-0-9-7
- Cycle 5: 7-4-0-6-7
- Cycle 6: 7-4-1-0-7
- Cycle 7: 7-4-1-2-7
- Cycle 8: 7-4-1-8-7
- Cycle 9: 7-8-2-1-7
- Cycle 10: 7-8-2-7

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 (7-5-3-4-7) has two chords: (5,4) and (3,7)
- Cycle 2 (7-5-9-7) has one chord: (5,9)
- Cycle 3 (7-4-3-0-7) has one chord: (4,0)
- Cycle 4 (7-4-0-9-7) has one chord: (4,9)
- Cycle 5 (7-4-0-6-7) has one chord: (4,6)
- Cycle 6 (7-4-1-0-7) has one chord: (4,1)
- Cycle 7 (7-4-1-2-7) has one chord: (4,2)
- Cycle 8 (7-4-1-8-7) has two chords: (1,8) and (4,7)
- Cycle 9 (7-8-2-1-7) has two chords: (2,1) and (8,7)
- Cycle 10 (7-8-2-7) has one chord: (2,8)

Step 3: 
Number of chordless 4-cycles = 0 (since all cycles have at least one chord)

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [0]. 
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <7, 5, 9, 7> with chord (5, 9)
- <7, 4, 3, 0, 7> with chord (4, 0)
- <7, 4, 0, 9, 7> with chord (4, 9)
- <7, 4, 0, 6, 7> with chord (4, 6)
- <7, 4, 1, 0, 7> with chord (4, 1)
- <7, 4, 1, 2, 7> with chord (4, 2)
- <7, 4, 1, 8, 7> with chord (1, 8)
- <7, 8, 2, 1, 7> with chords (2, 1) and (8, 7)
- <7, 8, 2, 7> with chord (2, 8)
