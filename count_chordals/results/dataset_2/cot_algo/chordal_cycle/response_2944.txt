Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <2, 5, 4, 9, 2>
- Cycle 3: <3, 6, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 4: <4, 1, 0, 8, 5, 4>
- Cycle 5: <5, 8, 0, 1, 4, 5>
- Cycle 6: <6, 3, 7, 4, 6>
- Cycle 7: <7, 4, 1, 0, 7>
- Cycle 8: <8, 5, 4, 6, 8>
- Cycle 9: <9, 4, 1, 0, 9>
- Cycle 10: <0, 8, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 11: <1, 4, 6, 3, 1>
- Cycle 12: <2, 5, 8, 0, 2>
- Cycle 13: <3, 6, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 14: <4, 5, 2, 9, 4>
- Cycle 15: <5, 4, 9, 2, 5>
- Cycle 16: <6, 7, 9, 4, 6>
- Cycle 17: <7, 3, 2, 5, 7>
- Cycle 18: <8, 0, 2, 9, 8>
- Cycle 19: <9, 2, 5, 8, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 1, 4, 5, (8, 0)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, 5, 4, 9, (2, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, 6, 4, 7, (3, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 1, 0, 8, (5, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 8, 0, 1, (5, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, 3, 7, 4, (6, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, 4, 1, 0, (7, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, 5, 4, 6, (8, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, 4, 1, 0, (9, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <0, 8, 5, 2, (0, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <1, 4, 6, 3, (1, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <2, 5, 8, 0, (2, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <3, 6, 7, 4, (3, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <4, 5, 2, 9, (4, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <5, 4, 9, 2, (5, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <6, 7, 9, 4, (6, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <7, 3, 2, 5, (7, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <8, 0, 2, 9, (8, 0)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <9, 2, 5, 8, (9, 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [0]
