Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 26) (27, 13) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 18) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 5) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 20) (0, 20) (0, 22) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 19) (11, 15) (11, 18) (28, 16) (28, 12) (28, 23) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 14) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 22) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 29) (9, 4) (9, 25) (9, 8) (9, 24) (16, 21) (16, 28) (16, 10) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 24) (19, 12) (2, 17) (22, 0) (22, 25) (22, 10) (17, 6) (17, 25) (17, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 5) (10, 16) (10, 22) (26, 27) (26, 20) (24, 9) (24, 19) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 18) (5, 21) (5, 14) (5, 23) (23, 28) (23, 5) (23, 3) (23, 12) (3, 27) (3, 23) (3, 18) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 23) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 29) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 29) (18, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<6, 15, 27, 26>, <9, 25, 22, 10>, <14, 5, 21, 1>, <18, 7, 4, 9>, <18, 7, 14, 6>, <18, 7, 14, 5>, <18, 3, 23, 5>, <18, 3, 23, 12>, <18, 3, 27, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The cycles <6, 15, 27, 26>, <9, 25, 22, 10>, <14, 5, 21, 1>, and <18, 7, 4, 9> have exactly one chord each. 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
