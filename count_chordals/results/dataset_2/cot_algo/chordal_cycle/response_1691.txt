Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, but we are specifically looking for cycles of length 4 that form a chordal 4-cycle.

Some of the cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-0-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-0-6-8-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-9-6-5
- Cycle 4: 5-0-1-9-5
- Cycle 5: 9-6-8-2-9
- Cycle 6: 6-8-2-5-6
- Cycle 7: 1-9-6-4-1
- Cycle 8: 3-7-8-6-3
- Cycle 9: 4-8-6-0-4
- Cycle 10: 7-5-0-6-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the listed cycles above, the following cycle is a chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (1, 6), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
