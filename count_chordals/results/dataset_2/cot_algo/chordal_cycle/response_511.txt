- Cycle 35: (14, 0, 3, 4, 14)
- Cycle 36: (14, 10, 12, 7, 14)
- Cycle 37: (2, 5, 9, 7, 2)
- Cycle 38: (2, 6, 4, 3, 2)
- Cycle 39: (2, 12, 7, 9, 2)

- Cycle 43: (8, 11, 13, 6, 8)
- Cycle 44: (8, 10, 12, 7, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The following chordal 4-cycles are found:
    - <1, (9, 2), 5>
    - <1, (9, 0), 5>
    - <1, (9, 7), 4>
    - <2, (6, 4), 5>
    - <2, (5, 1), 6>
    - <3, (8, 1), 5>
    - <3, (8, 0), 9>
    - <3, (9, 4), 6>
    - <4, (6, 7), 9>
    - <4, (9, 6), 7>
    - <4, (9, 7), 6>
    - <7, (12, 9), 4>
    - <9, (1, 3), 8>
    - <10, (12, 14), 7>
    - <12, (2, 7), 4>
    - <13, (2, 6), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are [16] chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
