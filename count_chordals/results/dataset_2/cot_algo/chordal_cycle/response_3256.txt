- Cycle 42: (4, 7, 6, 5)
- Cycle 43: (4, 0, 8, 5)
- Cycle 44: (5, 8, 1, 6)
- Cycle 45: (5, 6, 1, 3)
- Cycle 46: (5, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 47: (5, 6, 7, 2)
- Cycle 48: (6, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 49: (6, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 50: (6, 7, 4, 3)
- Cycle 51: (6, 7, 4, 0)
- Cycle 52: (7, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 53: (7, 4, 2, 5)
- Cycle 54: (7, 4, 6, 1)
- Cycle 55: (7, 4, 3, 6)
- Cycle 56: (8, 5, 6, 1)
- Cycle 57: (8, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 58: (8, 5, 6, 7)
- Cycle 59: (8, 5, 6, 3)
- Cycle 60: (9, 5, 4, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 4, 7> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <1, 6, 5, 8> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <1, 6, 7, 0> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <2, 7, 4, 5> (Chord: (2, 5))
- <2, 7, 6, 1> (Chord: (2, 1))
- <2, 7, 4, 3> (Chord: (2, 1))
- <2, 1, 8, 0> (Chord: (2, 5))
- <3, 7, 4, 5> (Chord: (3, 1))
- <4, 7, 6, 5> (Chord: (4, 2))
- <5, 6, 7, 4> (Chord: (5, 2))
- <6, 7, 3, 1> (Chord: (6, 5))
- <8, 5, 6, 1> (Chord: (8, 0))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [11].
