Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 5, 2, 4)  
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 0, 6, 1)  
- Cycle 3: (8, 1, 6, 0, 8)  
- Cycle 4: (7, 9, 3, 0, 7)  
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 4, 8, 5)  
- Cycle 6: (2, 6, 1, 5, 2)  
- Cycle 7: (4, 0, 6, 2, 4)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (7, 2)  
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (3, 6)  
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (1, 0)  
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (9, 0)  
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (7, 8)  
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (6, 1)  
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (0, 4)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.  

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].  
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:  
- <1, 3, 0, 6, 1> with a chord (3, 6)  
- <8, 1, 6, 0, 8> with a chord (1, 0)  
- <7, 9, 3, 0, 7> with a chord (9, 0)  
- <5, 7, 4, 8, 5> with a chord (7, 8)  
- <2, 6, 1, 5, 2> with a chord (6, 1)  
- <4, 0, 6, 2, 4> with a chord (0, 4)
