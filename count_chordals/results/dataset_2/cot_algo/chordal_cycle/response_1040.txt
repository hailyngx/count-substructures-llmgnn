Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - <Cycle 21, (8, 19)>
        - <Cycle 23, (8, 12)>
        - <Cycle 26, (14, 24)>
        - <Cycle 31, (1, 9)>
        - <Cycle 35, (1, 25)>
        - <Cycle 38, (2, 10)>
        - <Cycle 41, (2, 16)>
        - <Cycle 46, (0, 21)>
        - <Cycle 53, (9, 24)>
        - <Cycle 55, (12, 18)>


Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        
        There are 73 cycles listed above, out of which 9 cycles have exactly one chord.
        Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [64].
