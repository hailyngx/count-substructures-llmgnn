The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 1) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 6, 14, 8>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 3, 13>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 2, 3, 8>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 9, 3, 11>
- Cycle 5: <0, 11, 3, 9, 4>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 9, 7, 13>
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 10, 1, 7>
- Cycle 8: <1, 7, 9, 5, 6>
- Cycle 9: <1, 10, 4, 3, 13>
- Cycle 10: <2, 6, 14, 8, 12>
- Cycle 11: <2, 7, 1, 4, 10>
- Cycle 12: <2, 7, 9, 5, 6>
- Cycle 13: <2, 12, 0, 5, 9>
- Cycle 14: <2, 13, 3, 9, 4>
- Cycle 15: <3, 4, 10, 1, 7>
- Cycle 16: <3, 8, 11, 0, 5>
- Cycle 17: <3, 11, 0, 7, 2>
- Cycle 18: <3, 13, 6, 14, 8>
- Cycle 19: <4, 9, 5, 6, 14>
- Cycle 20: <4, 9, 7, 1, 10>
- Cycle 21: <4, 10, 1, 7, 13>
- Cycle 22: <6, 5, 9, 4, 10>
- Cycle 23: <6, 14, 8, 12, 2>
- Cycle 24: <7, 9, 5, 0, 11>
- Cycle 25: <8, 12, 2, 6, 14>

Step 2:
- Checking for chords in each cycle:
    - Cycle 1: <0, 5, 6, 14, 8> has 2 chords: (5, 14) and (6, 8).
    - Cycle 3: <0, 7, 2, 3, 8> has 1 chord: (7, 3).
    - Cycle 4: <0, 7, 9, 3, 11> has 1 chord: (7, 3).
    - Cycle 9: <1, 4, 10, 1, 7> has 1 chord: (4, 10).
    - Cycle 12: <2, 7, 9, 5, 6> has 1 chord: (7, 5).
    - Cycle 14: <2, 13, 3, 9, 4> has 1 chord: (13, 9).
    - Cycle 21: <4, 10, 1, 7, 13> has 1 chord: (10, 7).

Step 3:
- Count of chordal 4-cycles: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 5, 6, 14, 8>
- <0, 7, 2, 3, 8>
- <0, 7, 9, 3, 11>
- <1, 4, 10, 1, 7>
- <2, 7, 9, 5, 6>
- <2, 13, 3, 9, 4>
- <4, 10, 1, 7, 13>
