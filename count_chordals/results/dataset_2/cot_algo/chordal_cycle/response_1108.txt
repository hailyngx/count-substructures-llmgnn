Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-6-1-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-6-1-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-8-2-9-3-0
- Cycle 4: 0-8-2-1-7-0
- Cycle 5: 0-8-2-6-1-0
- Cycle 6: 0-8-2-6-3-0
- Cycle 7: 0-8-9-3-6-0

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-6-1-4-0 (Chord: 5-1)
- Cycle 2: 0-5-6-1-7-0 (Chord: 5-7)
- Cycle 3: 0-8-2-9-3-0 (Chord: 8-9)
- Cycle 4: 0-8-2-1-7-0 (Chord: 8-7)
- Cycle 5: 0-8-2-6-1-0 (Chord: 8-1)
- Cycle 6: 0-8-2-6-3-0 (Chord: 8-3)
- Cycle 7: 0-8-9-3-6-0 (Chord: 8-3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Final Answer: [7]
Unique Chordal 4-Cycles:
<0, 5, 1, 4> (Chord: 5-1)
<0, 5, 1, 7> (Chord: 5-7)
<0, 8, 2, 9> (Chord: 8-9)
<0, 8, 2, 1> (Chord: 8-1)
<0, 8, 2, 6> (Chord: 8-6)
<0, 8, 9, 3> (Chord: 8-3)
