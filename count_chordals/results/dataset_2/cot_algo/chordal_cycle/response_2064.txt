Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 24) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 20) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 21) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 13) (29, 28) (29, 12) (6, 28) (6, 7) (6, 26) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 21) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 7) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 15) (17, 19) (17, 27) (20, 3) (20, 26) (5, 19) (5, 7) (5, 27) (19, 2) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 16) (8, 9) (8, 0) (23, 11) (10, 21) (10, 13) (10, 24) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 10) (21, 0) (4, 22) (12, 29) (13, 28) (13, 10) (13, 15) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 16) (26, 7) (16, 22) (16, 19) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 25) (24, 1) (24, 10) (24, 16) (25, 9) (25, 16) (14, 3) (14, 22) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 26) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 21) (0, 15) (15, 22) (15, 13) (15, 0) (27, 17) (27, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's identify the chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph
- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 20, 26, 6>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 14, 22, 9>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 20, 26, 16>
- Cycle 4: <1, 18, 21, 11, 28>
- Cycle 5: <1, 18, 21, 10, 24>
- Cycle 6: <3, 1, 18, 21, 11>
- Cycle 7: <3, 1, 18, 21, 10>
- Cycle 8: <2, 1, 18, 21, 11>
- Cycle 9: <2, 1, 18, 21, 10>
- Cycle 10: <18, 1, 3, 14, 22>
- Cycle 11: <18, 21, 11, 28, 6>
- Cycle 12: <18, 21, 10, 24, 16>
- Cycle 13: <28, 6, 26, 16, 22>
- Cycle 14: <28, 11, 21, 18, 2>
- Cycle 15: <9, 22, 16, 26, 20>
- Cycle 16: <22, 16, 26, 20, 3>
- Cycle 17: <22, 16, 26, 7, 5>
- Cycle 18: <11, 21, 18, 2, 19>
- Cycle 19: <21, 10, 24, 16, 25>
- Cycle 20: <21, 11, 28, 13, 15>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 3, 20, 26> (Chord: (6, 16))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 18, 21, 11> (Chord: (28, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 18, 21, 10> (Chord: (24, 16))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 1, 18, 21> (Chord: (11, 19))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 22, 16, 26> (Chord: (20, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <11, 21, 18, 2> (Chord: (19, 11))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the count is [6]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, 3, 20, 26, (6, 16)>
<1, 18, 21, 11, (28, 6)>
<1, 18, 21, 10, (24, 16)>
<2, 1, 18, 21, (11, 19)>
<9, 22, 16, 26, (20, 3)>
<11, 21, 18, 2, (19, 11)>
