Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 5) (16, 12) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 19) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 7) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 19) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 8) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 0) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 7) (0, 12) (0, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 8, 10, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 8, 10, 2, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 10, 11, 5)
- Cycle 4: (6, 8, 10, 2, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 8, 10, 11, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 8, 14, 17, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 8, 19, 17, 6)
- Cycle 8: (5, 8, 14, 17, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 8, 14, 19, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 8, 19, 17, 5)
- Cycle 11: (5, 8, 19, 1, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 6, 7, 3, 5)
- Cycle 13: (6, 7, 3, 13, 6)
- Cycle 14: (6, 4, 13, 18, 6)
- Cycle 15: (6, 4, 1, 19, 6)
- Cycle 16: (4, 1, 7, 6, 4)
- Cycle 17: (4, 1, 19, 17, 4)
- Cycle 18: (4, 1, 19, 8, 4)
- Cycle 19: (4, 1, 7, 3, 4)
- Cycle 20: (13, 4, 1, 19, 13)
- Cycle 21: (13, 4, 6, 8, 13)
- Cycle 22: (13, 4, 12, 16, 13)
- Cycle 23: (13, 3, 7, 1, 13)
- Cycle 24: (13, 3, 7, 2, 13)
- Cycle 25: (13, 3, 7, 6, 13)
- Cycle 26: (13, 18, 9, 2, 13)
- Cycle 27: (13, 18, 9, 5, 13)
- Cycle 28: (8, 6, 7, 3, 8)
- Cycle 29: (8, 6, 7, 1, 8)
- Cycle 30: (8, 6, 4, 1, 8)
- Cycle 31: (8, 10, 2, 15, 8)
- Cycle 32: (8, 10, 2, 9, 8)
- Cycle 33: (8, 10, 2, 5, 8)
- Cycle 34: (10, 2, 15, 8, 10)
- Cycle 35: (10, 2, 9, 5, 10)
- Cycle 36: (6, 4, 1, 19, 8, 6)
- Cycle 37: (6, 8, 14, 19, 8, 6)
- Cycle 38: (6, 8, 19, 17, 14, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The cycle <5, 6, 8, 10, 5> has exactly one chord (8, 10) so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- The cycle <5, 8, 10, 11, 5> has exactly one chord (8, 10) so it is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found.

Final Answer: [2]
