Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 21) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 8) (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 18) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 27) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 17) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 10) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 10) (22, 6) (22, 5) (23, 7) (23, 29) (12, 2) (12, 10) (27, 9) (27, 25) (27, 4) (27, 17) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 8) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 18) (14, 1) (14, 0) (19, 26) (19, 2) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 8) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 7) (4, 27) (4, 15) (15, 4) (15, 13) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 28) (7, 24) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 21) (24, 16) (24, 7) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 27) (13, 25) (13, 15) (13, 29) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 21) (18, 6) (18, 20) (18, 5) (18, 10) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 18) (29, 23) (29, 0) (29, 13) (29, 21) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 26) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 5) (21, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 17, 27, 9, 6, 22, 5, 21, 2, 12, 10, 25, 13, 29, 23, 7, 24, 16, 8, 26, 19)
- Cycle 2: (0, 20, 1, 3, 28, 26, 19, 2, 12, 10, 25, 13, 29, 23, 7, 24, 16, 8, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 20, 18, 6, 9, 27, 17, 3, 1, 14, 19, 26, 28, 7, 23, 29, 13, 25, 10, 12)
- Cycle 4: (0, 8, 26, 19, 2, 21, 29, 13, 25, 10, 12, 27, 4, 15)
- Cycle 5: (2, 12, 10, 1, 20, 18, 5, 22, 6, 9, 27, 17)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (16, 17), 27, 9, 6, 22, 5, (21, 2), 12, 10, (25, 13), 29, 23, 7, 24, 16, 8, 26, 19>
- <0, 20, 1, (28, 26), 19, 2, 12, 10, (25, 13), 29, 23, 7, 24, 16, 8>
- <0, 20, 18, 6, 9, 27, (17, 3), 1, 14, 19, 26, 28, 7, 23, 29, 13, 25, 10, 12>
- <0, 8, 26, 19, 2, (21, 29), 13, 25, 10, 12, 27, 4, 15>
- <2, 12, 10, 1, 20, 18, 5, (22, 6), 9, 27, 17>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
