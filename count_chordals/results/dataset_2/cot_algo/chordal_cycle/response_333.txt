Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 12) (5, 14) (18, 13) (18, 8) (1, 15) (1, 11) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 2) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 14) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 11) (3, 17) (3, 8) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (8, 18) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 8) (13, 18) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 11) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 17) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle: 6 - 9 - 12 - 0 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 9 - 12 - 8 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 9 - 12 - 0 - 15 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 7 - 14 - 16 - 7
- Cycle: 6 - 7 - 14 - 8 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 7 - 14 - 16 - 13 - 18 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 7 - 14 - 8 - 12 - 9 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 7 - 10 - 2 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 7 - 10 - 2 - 17 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 7 - 10 - 2 - 15 - 0 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 17 - 11 - 1 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 17 - 11 - 13 - 18 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 17 - 11 - 13 - 0 - 12 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 17 - 2 - 15 - 0 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 17 - 2 - 15 - 19 - 0 - 6
- Cycle: 6 - 17 - 2 - 10 - 7 - 6

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (9, 12), 0, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (7, 14), 16, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (7, 14), 8, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (7, 14), 16, 13, 18, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (7, 14), 8, 12, 9, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (7, 10), 2, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (7, 10), 2, 17, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 17, (11, 13), 18, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 17, (11, 13), 0, 12, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 17, 2, (15, 0), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 17, 2, (15, 19), 0, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 17, 2, 10, (7, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 17, (11, 1), 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]
