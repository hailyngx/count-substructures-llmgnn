Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (0, 8)>
- <2, (7, 15)>
- <3, (0, 13)>
- <4, (0, 13)>
- <5, (2, 9)>
- <6, (2, 9)>
- <7, (0, 8)>
- <8, (0, 8)>
- <9, (0, 16)>
- <10, (0, 16)>
- <11, (11, 12)>
- <12, (11, 12)>
- <13, (4, 13)>
- <14, (4, 13)>
- <15, (15, 5)>
- <16, (15, 5)>
- <17, (3, 10)>
- <18, (3, 10)>
- <19, (3, 19)>
- <20, (3, 19)>
- <21, (0, 8)>
- <22, (0, 8)>
- <23, (3, 19)>
- <24, (3, 19)>
- <25, (12, 13)>
- <26, (12, 13)>

- <28, (1, 16)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [8]

The unique chordless 4-cycle is:
- <1, (0, 8)>
- <2, (7, 15)>
- <3, (0, 13)>
- <4, (2, 9)>
- <5, (11, 12)>
- <6, (4, 13)>
- <7, (15, 5)>
- <8, (3, 10)>
