Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 26) (9, 14) (0, 3) (0, 24) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 10) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 21) (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 28) (23, 26) (23, 21) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 25) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 21) (11, 25) (4, 22) (4, 20) (4, 17) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 1) (18, 29) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 18) (20, 4) (20, 29) (20, 19) (29, 15) (29, 18) (29, 20) (29, 16) (29, 10) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 1) (10, 27) (10, 29) (10, 21) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 10) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 12) (22, 25) (12, 15) (12, 2) (12, 22) (12, 24) (12, 28) (7, 17) (24, 0) (24, 27) (24, 12) (24, 17) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 16) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 24) (17, 28) (28, 15) (28, 19) (28, 12) (28, 17) (25, 2) (25, 11) (25, 22) (16, 6) (16, 29) (16, 14) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 0, 24, 27, 15)
- Cycle 2: (3, 0, 24, 12, 2)
- Cycle 3: (3, 0, 24, 12, 15)
- Cycle 4: (3, 11, 21, 10, 27)
- Cycle 5: (4, 22, 2, 12, 24)
- Cycle 6: (4, 22, 2, 12, 15)
- Cycle 7: (4, 22, 12, 15, 27)
- Cycle 8: (4, 22, 12, 24, 27)
- Cycle 9: (20, 29, 15, 12, 24)
- Cycle 10: (20, 29, 15, 27, 10)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (24, 15)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (24, 12)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (24, 12)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (21, 27)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (2, 24)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (2, 15)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (2, 27)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (2, 27)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (29, 15)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (29, 27)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (24, 15)>
<2, (24, 12)>
<4, (21, 27)>
<5, (2, 24)>
<6, (2, 15)>
<7, (2, 27)>
<8, (2, 27)>
<9, (29, 15)>
<10, (29, 27)>
