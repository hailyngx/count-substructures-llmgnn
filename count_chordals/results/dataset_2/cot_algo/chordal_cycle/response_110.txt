Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1-4-9-5-1
2. Cycle 1-4-9-2-6-1
3. Cycle 2-9-4-7-3-8-6-2
4. Cycle 3-4-9-2-6-8-3
5. Cycle 3-7-4-9-2-6-8-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, (2, 6), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [4] chordless cycles found.
