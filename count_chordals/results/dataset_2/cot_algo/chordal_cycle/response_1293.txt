Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 14) (21, 6) (21, 23) (10, 8) (10, 22) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 29) (11, 20) (20, 11) (20, 25) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 22) (1, 15) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 4) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 13) (29, 11) (29, 25) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 12) (2, 0) (2, 12) (24, 7) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 17) (6, 27) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 19) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 19) (16, 1) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 2) (19, 11) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 23) (22, 10) (22, 25) (22, 5) (22, 17) (5, 8) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 17) (18, 5) (18, 23) (23, 21) (23, 19) (23, 18) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 5) (13, 15) (13, 28) (4, 25) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

We can list down the cycles of length 4 or more present in the graph:

1. Cycle <0, 14, 3, 1, 0>
2. Cycle <0, 14, 12, 2, 0>
3. Cycle <1, 12, 2, 0, 1>
4. Cycle <3, 14, 0, 2, 3>
5. Cycle <6, 11, 19, 23, 6>
6. Cycle <7, 14, 0, 2, 7>
7. Cycle <8, 10, 22, 25, 8>
8. Cycle <9, 8, 10, 22, 9>
9. Cycle <9, 8, 5, 22, 9>
10. Cycle <11, 19, 23, 18, 11>
11. Cycle <14, 0, 2, 12, 14>
12. Cycle <15, 1, 3, 14, 15>
13. Cycle <17, 9, 8, 10, 17>
14. Cycle <17, 9, 19, 23, 17>
15. Cycle <17, 9, 19, 11, 17>
16. Cycle <17, 9, 8, 5, 17>
17. Cycle <20, 11, 19, 23, 20>
18. Cycle <24, 7, 14, 12, 24>
19. Cycle <25, 22, 10, 8, 25>
20. Cycle <26, 17, 9, 8, 26>
21. Cycle <26, 17, 5, 22, 26>
22. Cycle <28, 20, 11, 19, 28>
23. Cycle <29, 25, 22, 10, 29>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

After checking each cycle, we find the following chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord present:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 14, (0, 2), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 22 chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of the unique chordal 4-cycle found is [1].
