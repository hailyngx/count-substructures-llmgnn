Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-8-7-3-10-1-0
- Cycle 2: 2-6-7-8-4-10-1-0-2
- Cycle 3: 2-6-7-12-9-14-1-0-2
- Cycle 4: 2-6-7-12-11-5-8-4-10-2
- Cycle 5: 2-6-9-14-1-0-2
- Cycle 6: 2-6-9-12-7-8-4-10-2
- Cycle 7: 2-6-9-12-11-5-8-4-10-2
- Cycle 8: 2-6-13-3-7-8-4-10-2
- Cycle 9: 4-8-7-12-9-6-2-0-4
- Cycle 10: 4-8-7-12-11-5-2-0-4
- Cycle 11: 7-6-9-12-11-5-8-4-0-7
- Cycle 12: 7-8-5-11-12-9-6-2-0-7
- Cycle 13: 7-8-5-11-12-13-3-2-0-7
- Cycle 14: 7-8-5-2-6-9-12-11-4-7
- Cycle 15: 10-4-8-5-11-12-9-14-1-10
- Cycle 16: 10-4-8-7-12-11-5-2-10
- Cycle 17: 10-4-8-7-12-9-6-2-10
- Cycle 18: 10-4-8-7-3-13-2-10
- Cycle 19: 10-4-8-7-3-13-12-9-6-10
- Cycle 20: 10-4-8-7-3-13-12-11-5-10

Step 2:
Inspecting each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following chordal 4-cycle:
- <2, (6, 14), 1>

Step 3:
After counting the number of chordless cycles, we find that there are [19] such cycles.
