Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 1) (27, 5) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 23) (8, 0) (8, 23) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 18) (23, 25) (23, 8) (23, 13) (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 26) (22, 7) (26, 12) (26, 11) (20, 29) (20, 2) (20, 6) (29, 20) (29, 13) (29, 15) (29, 4) (11, 0) (11, 26) (11, 21) (28, 19) (28, 2) (1, 27) (1, 24) (6, 20) (6, 2) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 10) (9, 0) (9, 25) (9, 7) (9, 14) (15, 29) (24, 3) (24, 1) (24, 13) (24, 21) (4, 29) (4, 5) (4, 17) (5, 27) (5, 4) (5, 18) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 5) (13, 23) (13, 29) (13, 24) (13, 10) (17, 4) (17, 2) (10, 16) (10, 13) (19, 28) (19, 14) (21, 11) (21, 24) (2, 7) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 6) (2, 17) (14, 9) (14, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 27 - 1 - 24 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 27 - 5 - 4 - 29 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 27 - 5 - 18 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 11 - 26 - 12 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 11 - 26 - 12 - 16 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 6: 0 - 11 - 26 - 12 - 7 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 7: 0 - 11 - 26 - 12 - 16 - 18 - 3 - 0

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1: Contains chord (1, 24)
- Cycle 2: Contains chord (4, 29)
- Cycle 3: Contains chord (18, 5)
- Cycle 4: Contains chord (26, 12)
- Cycle 5: Contains chord (12, 16)
- Cycle 6: Contains chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 7: Contains chord (12, 16)

Step 3: Number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<1, (1, 24)>
<2, (4, 29)>
<3, (18, 5)>
<4, (26, 12)>
<5, (12, 16)>
<6, (7, 9)>
