Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (9, 5, 4, 7)
- Cycle 2: (9, 2, 7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (9, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 4, 6, 0)
- Cycle 5: (8, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 6: (8, 9, 4, 6)
- Cycle 7: (4, 5, 9, 2)
- Cycle 8: (4, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 9: (4, 7, 2, 6)

Step 2:
By checking each cycle, we find that Cycle 3: (9, 2, 6, 4) has exactly one chord, which is (2, 6). 

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <3, (2, 6)>.

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [8]
