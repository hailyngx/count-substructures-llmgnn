Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 5) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 7-3-13-1-7
- Cycle 2: 7-8-4-2-7
- Cycle 3: 7-8-9-2-7
- Cycle 4: 7-8-9-14-7
- Cycle 5: 7-11-12-6-7
- Cycle 6: 5-4-2-8-5
- Cycle 7: 5-4-7-11-5
- Cycle 8: 5-4-8-7-5
- Cycle 9: 5-0-14-9-5
- Cycle 10: 5-0-12-1-5
- Cycle 11: 5-0-14-13-5
- Cycle 12: 5-10-14-13-5
- Cycle 13: 5-12-1-8-5
- Cycle 14: 5-12-11-7-5

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, only Cycle 6: 5-4-2-8-5 has one chord (edge 4-8).

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<5-4-2-8-5>
