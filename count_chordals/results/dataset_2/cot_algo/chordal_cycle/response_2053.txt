Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (8, 3) (8, 19) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 19) (19, 8) (19, 9) (19, 11) (19, 16) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 13) (4, 11) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 10) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 15) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 18) (10, 16) (10, 2) (18, 12) (18, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 15) (15, 2) (15, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There is a cycle <1, 5, 14, 1> with edges (1, 5), (5, 14), (14, 1).
- There is another cycle <3, 9, 17, 3> with edges (3, 9), (9, 17), (17, 3).
- There is a cycle <4, 0, 2, 13, 4> with edges (4, 0), (0, 2), (2, 13), (13, 4).
- There is a cycle <7, 11, 19, 7> with edges (7, 11), (11, 19), (19, 7).
- There is one more cycle <16, 6, 18, 12, 16> with edges (16, 6), (6, 18), (18, 12), (12, 16).
- There is a cycle <1, 3, 9, 19, 11, 7, 6, 16, 12, 4, 0, 2, 13, 4> with edges (1, 3), (3, 9), (9, 19), (19, 11), (11, 7), (7, 6), (6, 16), (16, 12), (12, 4), (4, 0), (0, 2), (2, 13), (13, 4).

Step 2:
- Only the cycle <4, 0, 2, 13, 4> has a chord (0, 13).

Step 3:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle is <4, 0, 2, 13, 4> with chord (0, 13).
