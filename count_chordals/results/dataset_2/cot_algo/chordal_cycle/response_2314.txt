Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <0, 2, 6, 1> (length 4)
        - <0, 2, 3, 7> (length 4)
        - <0, 5, 9, 2> (length 4)
        - <0, 7, 5, 9> (length 4)
        - <1, 4, 8, 2> (length 4)
        - <2, 6, 1, 4> (length 4)
        - <2, 8, 4, 3> (length 4)
        - <3, 4, 1, 6> (length 4)
        - <4, 8, 2, 9> (length 4)
        - <5, 9, 2, 0> (length 4)
        - <5, 9, 4, 1, 6> (length 5)
        - <0, 2, 9, 5, 7> (length 5)
        - <2, 8, 4, 1, 6> (length 5)
        - <4, 1, 6, 7, 0> (length 5)
        - <5, 9, 4, 3, 2> (length 5)
        - <0, 2, 3, 7, 5> (length 5)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
        - <0, 2, 6, 1> (length 4) has the chord (2, 1) [Chordal 4-cycle: 1]
        - <0, 2, 3, 7> (length 4) has the chord (2, 3) [Chordal 4-cycle: 1]
        - <0, 5, 9, 2> (length 4) has the chord (5, 9) [Chordal 4-cycle: 1]
        - <0, 7, 5, 9> (length 4) has the chord (7, 9) [Chordal 4-cycle: 1]
        - <1, 4, 8, 2> (length 4) has the chord (4, 8) [Chordal 4-cycle: 1]
        - <2, 6, 1, 4> (length 4) has the chord (6, 4) [Chordal 4-cycle: 1]
        - <2, 8, 4, 3> (length 4) has the chord (8, 3) [Chordal 4-cycle: 1]
        - <3, 4, 1, 6> (length 4) has the chord (4, 6) [Chordal 4-cycle: 1]
        - <4, 8, 2, 9> (length 4) has the chord (8, 9) [Chordal 4-cycle: 1]
        - <5, 9, 2, 0> (length 4) has the chord (9, 0) [Chordal 4-cycle: 1]

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]
