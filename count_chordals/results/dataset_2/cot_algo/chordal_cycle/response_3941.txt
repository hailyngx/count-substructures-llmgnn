Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 18) (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 5) (29, 10) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 15) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 6) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 5) (27, 22) (27, 28) (27, 1) (27, 19) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 21) (23, 10) (23, 24) (21, 23) (21, 20) (21, 4) (28, 27) (28, 24) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 25) (26, 3) (5, 29) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 15) (19, 27) (19, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 24) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 27) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 5) (4, 21) (22, 27) (22, 6) (10, 2) (10, 29) (10, 23) (10, 26) (3, 14) (3, 26) (3, 24) (7, 20) (20, 14) (20, 21) (20, 7) (20, 18) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 28) (24, 9) (24, 3) (12, 8) (25, 26) (25, 18) (6, 13) (6, 22) (18, 16) (18, 20) (18, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<0, 16, 11, 15>
<0, 16, 18, 20>
<0, 5, 29, 2>
<1, 2, 9, 8>
<1, 14, 17, 15>
<3, 14, 17, 15>
<3, 26, 25, 18>
<3, 24, 23, 5>
<5, 29, 10, 2>
<5, 23, 10, 26>
<5, 15, 17, 14>
<8, 9, 19, 27>
<8, 23, 10, 2>
<11, 16, 0, 5>
<13, 8, 23, 10>
<13, 26, 25, 18>
<14, 3, 26, 25>
<14, 17, 15, 11>
<18, 25, 26, 13>
<18, 20, 21, 4>
<20, 18, 16, 11>
<20, 7, 21, 4>
<21, 23, 10, 2>
<21, 20, 18, 25>
<22, 27, 19, 9>
<24, 23, 5, 29>
<24, 28, 27, 22>
<24, 9, 19, 27>
<24, 3, 14, 1>
<25, 26, 10, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the listed cycles above, we can observe that the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <3, 14, 17, 15> (Chord: (14, 15))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [26].
