- <2, (13, 10), 1> - Chord: (13, 10)
- <3, (7, 11), 12> - Chord: (7, 11)
- <4, (13, 6), 1> - Chord: (13, 6)
- <5, (12, 7), 5> - Chord: (12, 7)
- <6, (13, 1), 6> - Chord: (13, 1)
- <8, (5, 12), 10> - Chord: (5, 12)
- <9, (4, 13), 9> - Chord: (4, 13)
- <9, (7, 1), 9> - Chord: (7, 1)
- <9, (7, 3), 9> - Chord: (7, 3)
- <9, (7, 11), 9> - Chord: (7, 11)
- <9, (9, 0), 9> - Chord: (9, 0)
- <9, (9, 2), 9> - Chord: (9, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
