Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 11) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 12) (8, 4) (8, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 11) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 15) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 12) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 9) (19, 2) (19, 13) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 19) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  

Cycles:  
- Cycle 1: <10, 0, 17, 6, 15, 1, 18, 2>  
- Cycle 2: <10, 0, 17, 11, 2, 18, 1, 15>  
- Cycle 3: <10, 0, 8, 4, 3, 11, 5, 11>  
- Cycle 4: <10, 14, 7, 16, 18, 2, 11, 5>  
- Cycle 5: <10, 14, 7, 13, 19, 2, 11, 5>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  

Chords in the cycles:  
- Cycle 1: (10, 17)  
- Cycle 2: (0, 15)  
- Cycle 3: (0, 8)  
- Cycle 4: (7, 11)  
- Cycle 5: (14, 2)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  

Since all the cycles listed above have exactly one chord each, there are no chordless cycles in this graph.  
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
