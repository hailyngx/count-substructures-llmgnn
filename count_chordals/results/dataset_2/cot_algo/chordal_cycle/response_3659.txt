Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 13) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 11) (13, 2) (13, 18) (7, 6) (7, 5) (16, 5) (16, 18) (0, 10) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 16) (11, 5) (11, 1) (12, 10) (12, 5) (19, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing:

1. Cycle <15, 3, 2, 14, 17>
2. Cycle <6, 17, 14, 2, 3, 15>
3. Cycle <15, 4, 8, 9, 3>
4. Cycle <5, 6, 17, 10, 0, 12>
5. Cycle <15, 1, 4, 2, 3, 9>
6. Cycle <6, 5, 7, 10, 17>
7. Cycle <18, 9, 3, 2, 14>
8. Cycle <9, 8, 4, 1, 15>
9. Cycle <5, 11, 1, 4, 2>
10. Cycle <16, 5, 12, 10, 0>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:

1. Chordal 4-cycle: <15, 3, 2, 14, 17> with chord (3, 14)
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 6, 17, 10, 0, 12> with chord (6, 10)
3. Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 5, 7, 10, 17> with chord (5, 10)
4. Chordal 4-cycle: <16, 5, 12, 10, 0> with chord (5, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
