Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 17) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 19) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 17) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 16) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 18) (17, 11) (17, 2) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 9) (7, 13) (7, 16) (16, 14) (16, 7) (16, 3) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 18) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 19) (12, 11) (12, 8) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (2, 10, 14, 16, 3)
- Cycle 2: (2, 17, 1, 15, 13)
- Cycle 3: (2, 9, 1, 17, 11)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 12, 11, 6)
- Cycle 5: (4, 14, 10, 2, 17)
- Cycle 6: (4, 3, 0, 8, 19)
- Cycle 7: (8, 0, 3, 16, 14)
- Cycle 8: (8, 19, 9, 1, 17)
- Cycle 9: (13, 15, 1, 17, 11)
- Cycle 10: (13, 18, 3, 4, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 <2, 10, 14, 16> has a chord (2, 14).
- Cycle 2 <2, 17, 1, 15> has a chord (2, 1).
- Cycle 3 <2, 9, 1, 17> has a chord (2, 1).
- Cycle 4 <4, 8, 12, 11> has a chord (8, 11).
- Cycle 6 <4, 3, 0, 8> has a chord (4, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:

- <2, 10, 14, 16> with chord (2, 14)
- <4, 3, 0, 8> with chord (4, 8)
