Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 12) (10, 14) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-6-11-0
- Cycle 2: 1-7-4-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-11-12-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-8-6-1
- Cycle 5: 2-4-6-8-2
- Cycle 6: 2-4-12-10-2
- Cycle 7: 2-5-13-3-2
- Cycle 8: 5-13-3-14-5
- Cycle 9: 4-12-11-7-4
- Cycle 10: 2-12-10-14-2

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (4, 11)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (7, 11)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (8, 6)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (4, 10)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (5, 3)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (5, 14)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (12, 7)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (12, 10)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (4, 11)>
<2, (1, 4)>
<3, (7, 11)>
<4, (8, 6)>
<5, (4, 8)>
<6, (4, 10)>
<7, (5, 3)>
<8, (5, 14)>
<9, (12, 7)>
<10, (12, 10)>
