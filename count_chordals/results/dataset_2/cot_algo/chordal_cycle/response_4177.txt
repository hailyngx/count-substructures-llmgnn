Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 6, 5) with edges (5, 9), (9, 3), (3, 6), (6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (7, 9, 3, 0, 7) with edges (7, 9), (9, 3), (3, 0), (0, 7)
- Cycle 3: (7, 4, 1, 5, 7) with edges (7, 4), (4, 1), (1, 5), (5, 7)
- Cycle 4: (8, 1, 5, 6, 8) with edges (8, 1), (1, 5), (5, 6), (6, 8)
- Cycle 5: (8, 6, 3, 0, 8) with edges (8, 6), (6, 3), (3, 0), (0, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 2 has chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 3 has chord (4, 5)
- Cycle 4 has chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 5 has chord (6, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
