Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-9-6-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-5-7-1
- Cycle 3: 2-9-6-8-2
- Cycle 4: 7-5-4-1-7
- Cycle 5: 8-6-4-1-8
- Cycle 6: 2-3-5-7-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (3, 5)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (5, 4)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (3, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

List of unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, 9, 6, 4, 1>
- <1, 3, 5, 7, 1>
- <2, 9, 6, 8, 2>
- <7, 5, 4, 1, 7>
- <8, 6, 4, 1, 8>
- <2, 3, 5, 7, 2>
