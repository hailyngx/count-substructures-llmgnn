Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 3, 0, 4, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 6, 2, 7, 1, 9)
- Cycle 5: (6, 4, 8, 1, 7, 6)
- Cycle 6: (4, 8, 3, 0, 7, 4)
- Cycle 7: (7, 1, 5, 3, 0, 7)
- Cycle 8: (1, 3, 2, 7, 1)
- Cycle 9: (3, 0, 7, 2, 5, 3)
- Cycle 10: (8, 4, 6, 9, 5, 8)
- Cycle 11: (0, 3, 2, 6, 4, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (6, 1)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (7, 2)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (2, 3)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (4, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless cycles found in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (9, 6), 5)>
- <2, (1, 5), 7)>
- <3, (4, 6), 5)>
- <4, (6, 9), 2)>
- <5, (6, 1), 7)>
- <6, (7, 8), 4)>
- <7, (1, 3), 7)>
- <8, (7, 2), 1)>
- <9, (2, 3), 5)>
- <10, (9, 5), 8)>
- <11, (4, 2), 6)>
