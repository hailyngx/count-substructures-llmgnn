Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 3)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 0, 6)
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 0, 9)
- Cycle 6: (5, 4, 7, 2)
- Cycle 7: (5, 4, 8, 1)
- Cycle 8: (9, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 9: (9, 1, 0, 6)
- Cycle 10: (9, 7, 4, 8)
- Cycle 11: (9, 7, 2, 6)
- Cycle 12: (6, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 13: (6, 7, 4, 8)
- Cycle 14: (6, 2, 7, 9)
- Cycle 15: (6, 2, 8, 1)
- Cycle 16: (1, 3, 7, 2)
- Cycle 17: (1, 3, 0, 9)
- Cycle 18: (1, 0, 6, 2)
- Cycle 19: (1, 0, 9, 5)
- Cycle 20: (3, 7, 4, 8)
- Cycle 21: (3, 0, 6, 2)
- Cycle 22: (4, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 23: (4, 7, 2, 6)
- Cycle 24: (4, 8, 1, 3)
- Cycle 25: (4, 8, 2, 6)
- Cycle 26: (7, 3, 1, 8)
- Cycle 27: (7, 3, 0, 6)
- Cycle 28: (7, 4, 8, 2)
- Cycle 29: (8, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 30: (8, 1, 0, 9)
- Cycle 31: (8, 4, 7, 2)
- Cycle 32: (8, 4, 2, 6)
- Cycle 33: (2, 7, 4, 8)
- Cycle 34: (2, 7, 9, 5)
- Cycle 35: (2, 8, 1, 3)
- Cycle 36: (2, 8, 4, 7)
- Cycle 37: (0, 6, 2, 7)
- Cycle 38: (0, 6, 2, 8)
- Cycle 39: (0, 9, 5, 4)
- Cycle 40: (0, 9, 1, 8)

Step 2:
- Checking these cycles one by one, the chordal 4-cycles are:
  <1, (3, 7), 8)
  <4, (2, 8), 7>
  <7, (4, 8), 2>
  <9, (1, 0), 6>
  <9, (2, 6), 7>
  <9, (4, 7), 8>
  <5, (0, 9), 6>
  <5, (6, 9), 0>
  <5, (4, 7), 9>
  <5, (9, 0), 6>

Step 3:
- Count of unique chordal 4-cycles = [10]
