Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 8, 6, 10, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 4, 7, 0, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 4, 7, 9, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 5, 2, 1, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 7, 0, 10, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 7, 4, 5, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 8, 6, 10, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 8, 14, 7, 3)
- Cycle 11: (7, 4, 5, 2, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 0, 6, 10, 7)
- Cycle 13: (7, 0, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 0, 10, 12, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 4, 3, 1, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 14, 8, 3, 7)
- Cycle 17: (10, 6, 8, 3, 10)
- Cycle 18: (10, 6, 9, 7, 10)
- Cycle 19: (10, 0, 1, 3, 10)
- Cycle 20: (10, 0, 7, 4, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (2, 5), 3> (Chord: (1, 5))
- <2, (1, 3), 5> (Chord: (1, 3))
- <3, (4, 7), 5> (Chord: (4, 7))
- <4, (3, 1), 7> (Chord: (3, 1))
- <5, (2, 7), 3> (Chord: (2, 7))
- <6, (8, 10), 1> (Chord: (8, 10))
- <7, (2, 5), 4> (Chord: (2, 5))
- <8, (6, 13), 10> (Chord: (6, 13))
- <9, (6, 11), 7> (Chord: (6, 11))
- <10, (0, 12), 6> (Chord: (0, 12))
- <11, (9, 12), 10> (Chord: (9, 12))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found: [11]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph provided is [11].
