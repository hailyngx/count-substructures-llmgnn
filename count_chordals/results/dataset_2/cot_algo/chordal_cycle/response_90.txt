Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 2) (22, 26) (22, 6) (22, 1) (5, 9) (5, 23) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 0) (15, 27) (15, 25) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 21) (27, 7) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 1) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 28) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 24) (11, 10) (11, 6) (0, 9) (0, 20) (0, 21) (6, 22) (6, 11) (6, 28) (6, 3) (28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 1) (26, 22) (26, 29) (3, 6) (3, 24) (3, 16) (21, 27) (21, 0) (21, 19) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (19, 21) (19, 24) (1, 22) (1, 20) (1, 28) (1, 29) (1, 8) (29, 27) (29, 26) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 8) (7, 27) (7, 29) (7, 2) (23, 5) (24, 9) (24, 10) (24, 3) (24, 19) (18, 10) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 16) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 29) (8, 12) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 8) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 9, 5, 23)
- Cycle 2: (6, 22, 26, 29)
- Cycle 3: (1, 22, 26, 29)
- Cycle 4: (6, 22, 1, 28)
- Cycle 5: (6, 28, 25, 17)
- Cycle 6: (6, 28, 1, 29)
- Cycle 7: (25, 17, 2, 7)
- Cycle 8: (25, 17, 12, 14)
- Cycle 9: (25, 17, 2, 4)
- Cycle 10: (27, 21, 0, 9)
- Cycle 11: (27, 21, 0, 20)
- Cycle 12: (27, 21, 19, 24)
- Cycle 13: (27, 21, 0, 20)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (22, 26), 29> - Chord: (26, 29)
- <1, (6, 28), 25> - Chord: (6, 28)
- <1, (6, 22), 26> - Chord: (6, 22)
- <1, (6, 28), 25> - Chord: (6, 28)
- <2, (17, 7), 25> - Chord: (17, 7)
- <2, (17, 12), 14> - Chord: (17, 12)
- <2, (17, 4), 25> - Chord: (17, 4)
- <0, (21, 9), 27> - Chord: (21, 9)
- <0, (21, 20), 27> - Chord: (21, 20)
- <0, (21, 24), 19> - Chord: (21, 24)
- <0, (21, 20), 27> - Chord: (21, 20)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
