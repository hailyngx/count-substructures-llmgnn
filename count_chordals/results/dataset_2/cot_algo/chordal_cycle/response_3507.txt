Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 10) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 19) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 18) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (17, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (4, 11) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 2) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 0) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (8, 7) (9, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1 - 16 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 2: 3 - 10 - 16 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 3: 3 - 10 - 13 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 4: 3 - 6 - 5 - 19 - 3
- Cycle 5: 3 - 6 - 2 - 14 - 3
- Cycle 6: 3 - 18 - 19 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 7: 3 - 18 - 14 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 8: 10 - 16 - 15 - 6 - 10
- Cycle 9: 16 - 1 - 19 - 5 - 16
- Cycle 10: 16 - 5 - 6 - 15 - 16
- Cycle 11: 5 - 6 - 15 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 12: 5 - 6 - 2 - 12 - 5
- Cycle 13: 5 - 19 - 18 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 14: 5 - 19 - 1 - 16 - 5
- Cycle 15: 18 - 19 - 1 - 16 - 18
- Cycle 16: 18 - 19 - 0 - 2 - 18
- Cycle 17: 18 - 3 - 0 - 19 - 18
- Cycle 18: 18 - 3 - 6 - 5 - 18
- Cycle 19: 18 - 14 - 2 - 0 - 18
- Cycle 20: 18 - 14 - 7 - 13 - 18

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, (10, 16), 5, 1> has exactly one chord (10, 16)
- <3, 10, 13, 7, 3> has exactly one chord (10, 13)
- <3, (6, 5), 19, 3> has exactly one chord (6, 5)
- <3, 6, 2, 14, 3> has exactly one chord (6, 2)
- <3, (18, 19), 5, 3> has exactly one chord (18, 19)
- <3, 18, 14, 7, 3> has exactly one chord (18, 14)
- <10, (16, 15), 6, 10> has exactly one chord (16, 15)
- <16, 1, 19, 5, 16> has exactly one chord (1, 5)
- <16, 5, (6, 15), 16> has exactly one chord (6, 15)
- <5, (6, 15), 9, 5> has exactly one chord (6, 15)
- <5, 6, 2, 12, 5> has exactly one chord (6, 2)
- <5, 19, 18, 3, 5> has exactly one chord (19, 18)
- <5, 19, 1, 16, 5> has exactly one chord (19, 1)
- <18, 19, 1, 16, 18> has exactly one chord (19, 1)
- <18, 19, 0, 2, 18> has exactly one chord (19, 0)
- <18, 3, 0, 19, 18> has exactly one chord (3, 0)
- <18, 3, 6, 5, 18> has exactly one chord (3, 6)
- <18, 14, 2, 0, 18> has exactly one chord (14, 2)
- <18, 14, 7, 13, 18> has exactly one chord (14, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. Since all 20 cycles found have exactly one chord, the count of chordless cycles is [0].
