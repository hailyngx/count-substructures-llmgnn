Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 10) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 5, 11, 9, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 1, 0, 5, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 2, 14, 0, 1, 6)
- Cycle 4: (9, 8, 7, 5, 11, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 4, 3, 12, 14, 2, 6, 9)
- Cycle 6: (5, 7, 14, 12, 3, 9, 11, 5)
- Cycle 7: (0, 1, 14, 12, 3, 9, 6, 5, 0)
- Cycle 8: (14, 7, 5, 11, 2, 4, 3, 12, 14)
- Cycle 9: (7, 8, 9, 4, 10, 13, 2, 11, 7)
- Cycle 10: (12, 14, 0, 1, 6, 2, 13, 10, 3, 12)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (5, 11), 9>
- Cycle 2: <1, (0, 14), 6>
- Cycle 3: <1, (14, 2), 6>
- Cycle 4: <8, (7, 5), 9>
- Cycle 5: <4, (3, 12), 9>
- Cycle 6: Not chordal
- Cycle 7: Not chordal
- Cycle 8: Not chordal
- Cycle 9: Not chordal
- Cycle 10: Not chordal

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (5, 11), 9>
<1, (0, 14), 6>
<1, (14, 2), 6>
