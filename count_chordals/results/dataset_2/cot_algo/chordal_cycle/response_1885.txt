Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-5-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-9-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-9-8-4
- Cycle 4: 0-4-6-7-0
- Cycle 5: 1-5-7-2-1
- Cycle 6: 3-7-9-4-3

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (5, 7), 0> (Chord: 5-7)
- Cycle 2: <0, (4, 9), 7> (Chord: 4-9)
- Cycle 3: <4, (8, 9), 0> (Chord: 8-9)
- Cycle 4: Not a chordal 4-cycle as it has two chords.
- Cycle 5: Not a chordal 4-cycle as it has two chords.
- Cycle 6: <7, (9, 4), 3> (Chord: 9-4)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found: [3]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, (4, 9), 7>
- <4, (8, 9), 0>
- <7, (9, 4), 3>
