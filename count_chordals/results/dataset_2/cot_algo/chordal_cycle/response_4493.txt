Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 15) (18, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 3) (19, 5) (19, 11) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 16) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 17) (4, 16) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 15) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 7) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 0) (16, 3) (16, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Potential cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-2-15-5
- Cycle 2: 5-13-3-6-5
- Cycle 3: 5-19-11-14-5
- Cycle 4: 5-9-2-7-5
- Cycle 5: 2-9-15-7-2
- Cycle 6: 3-13-12-6-3
- Cycle 7: 3-14-11-19-3
- Cycle 8: 3-17-12-0-3
- Cycle 9: 3-8-7-2-3
- Cycle 10: 3-14-11-19-5-13-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (6, 14), 13>
- Chord: (6, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [9].
