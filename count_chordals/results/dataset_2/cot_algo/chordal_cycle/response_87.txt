Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 24) (2, 11) (29, 19) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (13, 17) (13, 25) (13, 14) (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 10) (4, 21) (4, 26) (5, 25) (5, 3) (6, 15) (6, 27) (17, 13) (17, 23) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 28) (9, 24) (22, 9) (22, 12) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 15) (28, 9) (28, 26) (28, 1) (28, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 28) (7, 0) (7, 1) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 3) (25, 13) (25, 5) (25, 18) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 19) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 27) (14, 20) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 19) (24, 2) (24, 9) (24, 11) (24, 20) (18, 9) (18, 25) (18, 20) (23, 4) (23, 17) (1, 28) (1, 7) (19, 29) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 27) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 26) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 16) (20, 14) (20, 24) (20, 18) (20, 21) (20, 10) (21, 4) (21, 20) (27, 6) (27, 14) (27, 19) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 4-8-15-6-4
- Cycle 2: 4-8-16-12-4
- Cycle 3: 4-10-12-22-4
- Cycle 4: 4-10-20-21-4
- Cycle 5: 4-10-20-24-4
- Cycle 6: 4-21-20-14-4
- Cycle 7: 8-16-12-22-8
- Cycle 8: 8-16-12-10-8
- Cycle 9: 8-15-6-27-8
- Cycle 10: 13-14-27-19-13
- Cycle 11: 13-14-20-21-13
- Cycle 12: 13-14-20-24-13
- Cycle 13: 13-17-23-4-13
- Cycle 14: 13-17-23-22-13
- Cycle 15: 13-17-25-18-13
- Cycle 16: 25-18-20-14-25
- Cycle 17: 25-18-20-10-25
- Cycle 18: 25-18-9-24-25
- Cycle 19: 16-12-22-9-16
- Cycle 20: 27-6-15-8-27
- Cycle 21: 27-14-20-24-27
- Cycle 22: 27-19-29-19-27

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <4, (8, 15), 6, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (8, 16), 12, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (10, 20), 21, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <13, (14, 27), 19, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <13, (14, 20), 21, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <13, (17, 23), 4, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <25, (18, 20), 14, 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <16, (12, 22), 9, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <27, (14, 20), 24, 27>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are a total of [9] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
