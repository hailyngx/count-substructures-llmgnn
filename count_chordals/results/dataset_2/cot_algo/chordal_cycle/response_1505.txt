Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 6) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with all edges in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 12, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 12, 2, 5, 8, 3, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 1, 12, 7, 8, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 3, 8, 5, 2, 12, 7, 0, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 3, 8, 5, 11, 10, 9, 13, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 3, 8, 7, 12, 2, 5, 13, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 3, 8, 7, 12, 14, 13, 5, 2, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 9, 10, 11, 6, 0, 7, 12, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 9, 10, 11, 6, 3, 8, 7, 0, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 9, 13, 5, 11, 6, 0, 7, 12, 1>
- Cycle 11: <1, 9, 13, 14, 12, 7, 0, 6, 3, 8, 1>
- Cycle 12: <1, 4, 3, 6, 0, 7, 12, 1>
- Cycle 13: <1, 4, 3, 6, 11, 5, 8, 7, 0, 1>
- Cycle 14: <2, 12, 7, 0, 6, 3, 8, 5, 11, 2>
- Cycle 15: <2, 12, 7, 0, 6, 11, 9, 13, 14, 2>
- Cycle 16: <2, 12, 7, 0, 6, 11, 10, 9, 13, 2>
- Cycle 17: <2, 5, 11, 10, 9, 13, 14, 12, 7, 2>
- Cycle 18: <2, 5, 11, 10, 9, 13, 4, 1, 12, 2>
- Cycle 19: <2, 5, 8, 7, 12, 1, 6, 11, 10, 2>
- Cycle 20: <3, 6, 0, 7, 8, 5, 11, 10, 9, 13, 3>
- Cycle 21: <3, 6, 0, 7, 12, 1, 9, 13, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 22: <3, 4, 1, 12, 7, 0, 6, 11, 5, 8, 3>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 12)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (12, 7)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (10, 11)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the answer is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 7, 12, 2, 5, 8, 3, 6, 0> with (1, 12) as the chord
- <0, 6, 1, 12, 7, 8, 5, 2, 0> with (12, 7) as the chord
- <1, 9, 10, 11, 6, 0, 7, 12, 1> with (10, 11) as the chord
