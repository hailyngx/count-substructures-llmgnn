Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are as follows:
1. (6, 9, 3, 0)
2. (6, 9, 1, 7)
3. (6, 0, 3, 2)
4. (6, 0, 1, 7)
5. (9, 5, 8, 7)
6. (9, 3, 2, 4)
7. (9, 3, 7, 1)
8. (5, 8, 7, 1)
9. (5, 8, 2, 0)
10. (0, 2, 8, 7)
11. (0, 2, 3, 9)
12. (2, 8, 7, 3)
13. (2, 8, 5, 6)
14. (8, 5, 6, 7)
15. (8, 5, 0, 2)
16. (8, 7, 3, 9)
17. (8, 7, 1, 5)
18. (7, 6, 0, 2)
19. (7, 6, 9, 5)
20. (7, 3, 2, 0)
21. (7, 3, 9, 1)
22. (3, 9, 4, 1)
23. (3, 0, 1, 4)
24. (3, 2, 4, 1)
25. (3, 2, 8, 5)
26. (3, 7, 1, 4)
27. (1, 9, 4, 3)
28. (1, 7, 3, 4)
29. (1, 7, 6, 9)
30. (1, 0, 3, 4)
31. (4, 9, 3, 2)
32. (4, 1, 7, 6)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (7, 9), 4>
- <2, (0, 8), 3>
- <5, (8, 2), 7>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [3].
