Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 3, 6, 4)
- Cycle 3: (8, 0, 1, 9, 8)
- Cycle 4: (13, 2, 12, 8, 13)
- Cycle 5: (10, 0, 1, 14, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Checking Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 5) - No chord present
Checking Cycle 2: (4, 7, 3, 6, 4) - Chord (3, 7) present
Checking Cycle 3: (8, 0, 1, 9, 8) - No chord present
Checking Cycle 4: (13, 2, 12, 8, 13) - Chord (12, 2) present
Checking Cycle 5: (10, 0, 1, 14, 10) - No chord present

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 3 chordless cycles (Cycle 1, Cycle 3, and Cycle 5). Therefore, the final count is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <4, 7, 3, 6, 4> with chord (3, 7)
- <13, 2, 12, 8, 13> with chord (12, 2)
- <10, 0, 1, 14, 10>
