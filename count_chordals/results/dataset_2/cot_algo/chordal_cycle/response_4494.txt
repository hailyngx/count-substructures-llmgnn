Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-3-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-5-7-1
- Cycle 3: 2-6-7-1-2
- Cycle 4: 3-4-5-7-3

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (6, 1)
- Cycle 4 has no chord.

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 4, 5, 7> with chord (1, 7)
- <2, 6, 7, 1> with chord (6, 1)
