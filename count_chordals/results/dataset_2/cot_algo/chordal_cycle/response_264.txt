Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 14) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 18) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 15) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 0) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 17) (17, 19) (17, 12) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 1) (2, 0) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 10) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 15) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 6) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 8, 13, 4)
- Cycle 2: (6, 7, 13, 6)
- Cycle 3: (8, 13, 18, 8)
- Cycle 4: (9, 3, 5, 9)
- Cycle 5: (14, 16, 18, 14)
- Cycle 6: (2, 11, 16, 2)
- Cycle 7: (15, 6, 7, 15)
- Cycle 8: (12, 8, 4, 12)
- Cycle 9: (15, 9, 3, 15)
- Cycle 10: (10, 14, 16, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <1, (2, 4), 5> (Chord: (2, 4))
- <2, (3, 8), 11> (Chord: (3, 8))
- <3, (5, 9), 11> (Chord: (5, 9))
- <4, (8, 13), 4> (Chord: (8, 13))
- <6, (7, 13), 6> (Chord: (7, 13))
- <8, (13, 18), 8> (Chord: (13, 18))
- <9, (3, 15), 9> (Chord: (3, 15))
- <10, (14, 16), 10> (Chord: (14, 16))
- <14, (8, 14), 15> (Chord: (8, 14))
- <15, (9, 15), 6> (Chord: (9, 15))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless cycles found within the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
