Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 12) (22, 25) (3, 5) (15, 23) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 26) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (28, 13) (28, 29) (28, 10) (28, 23) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 10) (0, 20) (0, 18) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 23) (20, 11) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 25) (18, 0) (18, 2) (18, 27) (18, 24) (18, 17) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (26, 4) (26, 20) (26, 14) (9, 22) (9, 1) (9, 27) (17, 18) (17, 6) (27, 18) (27, 9) (27, 19) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 2) (19, 27) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 6) (16, 24) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 19) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 19) (12, 22) (12, 10) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 23) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 20) (23, 24) (7, 15) (7, 1) (7, 5) (25, 22) (25, 2) (10, 28) (10, 29) (10, 2) (10, 12) (11, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (4, 8, 14, 26, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (18, 2, 4, 29, 28, 23, 20, 26, 14, 8, 4, 2, 18)
        - Cycle 3: (22, 13, 28, 23, 24, 16, 24, 23, 20, 11, 20, 0, 18, 17, 6, 1, 7, 15, 23, 28, 13)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 26, 20, 23, 15, 7, 5, 19, 2, 10, 29, 28, 13, 22, 12, 10, 2, 4)
        - Cycle 5: (15, 7, 5, 19, 27, 18, 24, 16, 24, 23, 28, 13, 22, 9, 1, 7)
        - Cycle 6: (22, 9, 1, 7, 15, 14, 19, 5, 3, 5, 7, 1, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1: (4, 8, 14, 26, 4) - has a chord (8, 26) 
        - Cycle 2: (18, 2, 4, 29, 28, 23, 20, 26, 14, 8, 4, 2, 18) - has a chord (4, 28)
        - Cycle 3: (22, 13, 28, 23, 24, 16, 24, 23, 20, 11, 20, 0, 18, 17, 6, 1, 7, 15, 23, 28, 13) - has a chord (13, 23)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 26, 20, 23, 15, 7, 5, 19, 2, 10, 29, 28, 13, 22, 12, 10, 2, 4) - has a chord (23, 10)
        - Cycle 5: (15, 7, 5, 19, 27, 18, 24, 16, 24, 23, 28, 13, 22, 9, 1, 7) - has a chord (7, 24)
        - Cycle 6: (22, 9, 1, 7, 15, 14, 19, 5, 3, 5, 7, 1, 9) - has a chord (1, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        - There are 0 chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
