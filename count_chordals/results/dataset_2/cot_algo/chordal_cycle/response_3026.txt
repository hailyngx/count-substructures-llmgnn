Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 4 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 2: 10 - 11 - 8 - 4 - 10
- Cycle 3: 6 - 4 - 8 - 10 - 6
- Cycle 4: 13 - 10 - 0 - 5 - 13
- Cycle 5: 0 - 5 - 7 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 6: 2 - 7 - 9 - 12 - 2
- Cycle 7: 12 - 9 - 14 - 6 - 12
- Cycle 8: 3 - 0 - 10 - 6 - 3
- Cycle 9: 1 - 11 - 8 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 10: 13 - 1 - 7 - 2 - 13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 is chordal: <1, (4, 8), 1>
- Cycle 2 is chordal: <2, (4, 10), 2>
- Cycle 3 is chordal: <3, (8, 10), 3>
- Cycle 4 is chordal: <4, (0, 5), 4>
- Cycle 5 is chordal: <5, (5, 7), 5>
- Cycle 6 is chordal: <6, (9, 12), 6>
- Cycle 7 is chordal: <7, (9, 14), 7>
- Cycle 8 is chordal: <8, (0, 10), 8>
- Cycle 9 is chordal: <9, (1, 7), 9>
- Cycle 10 is chordal: <10, (2, 13), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the answer is [10].
