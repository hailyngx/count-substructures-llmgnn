Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle: 0-6-4-1-0
2. Cycle: 1-4-2-5-1
3. Cycle: 3-6-1-9-3
4. Cycle: 5-7-8-9-5
5. Cycle: 8-7-5-2-8

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, the cycle 1-4-2-5-1 has exactly one chord (4, 5). The other cycles do not have any chords. 

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (4, 5)>
