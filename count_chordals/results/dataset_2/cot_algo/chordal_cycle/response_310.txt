The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (2, 8) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 16) (1, 7) (1, 12) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 12) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 19) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 18) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 2) (16, 9) (16, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 8, 2, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 8, 15, 5>
- Cycle 3: <9, 8, 15, 17, 9>
- Cycle 4: <9, 8, 2, 0, 9>
- Cycle 5: <9, 8, 2, 11, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 8, 13, 3, 9>
- Cycle 7: <9, 8, 13, 3, 6, 9>
- Cycle 8: <9, 8, 7, 1, 12, 9>
- Cycle 9: <9, 8, 7, 1, 12, 3, 9>
- Cycle 10: <9, 8, 7, 14, 5, 9>
- Cycle 11: <4, 19, 17, 6, 3, 13, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 19, 6, 3, 13, 4>
- Cycle 13: <7, 14, 18, 16, 9, 8, 13, 7>
- Cycle 14: <7, 14, 5, 9, 8, 13, 7>
- Cycle 15: <8, 15, 17, 6, 3, 13, 8>
- Cycle 16: <8, 2, 0, 11, 17, 6, 3, 13, 8>
- Cycle 17: <8, 2, 0, 11, 17, 15, 8>
- Cycle 18: <13, 3, 6, 17, 11, 0, 2, 8, 13>
- Cycle 19: <13, 3, 12, 1, 7, 14, 18, 16, 15, 8, 13>
- Cycle 20: <13, 3, 9, 8, 7, 14, 18, 16, 15, 12, 13>

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 8, 2, 5> (Chord: (9, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 9, 8, 15, 5> (Chord: (9, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, 8, 15, 17, 9> (Chord: (8, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, 8, 2, 0, 9> (Chord: (2, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, 8, 2, 11, 9> (Chord: (8, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, 8, 13, 3, 9> (Chord: (8, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <9, 8, 7, 1, 12, 9> (Chord: (8, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, 19, 17, 6, 3, 13, 4> (Chord: (19, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <13, 3, 6, 17, 11, 0, 2, 8, 13> (Chord: (3, 8))

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles found: [11]
