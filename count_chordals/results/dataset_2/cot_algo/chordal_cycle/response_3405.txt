Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 2: 4 - 7 - 12 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 7 - 10 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 4: 6 - 9 - 10 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 5: 6 - 9 - 8 - 4 - 6
- Cycle 6: 6 - 9 - 1 - 13 - 6
- Cycle 7: 1 - 9 - 6 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 8: 1 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 9: 8 - 9 - 12 - 4 - 8
- Cycle 10: 12 - 9 - 6 - 0 - 12
- Cycle 11: 0 - 6 - 14 - 13 - 0

Step 2:
Checking for chords:
- <4, 8, 7, 12> has chord (7, 12)
- <6, 9, 1, 13> has chord (9, 1)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, 8, 7, 12>
- <6, 9, 1, 13>
