Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 17) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 21) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 0) (25, 4) (25, 22) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 16) (9, 6) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 27) (10, 4) (11, 2) (11, 10) (11, 23) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 0) (8, 27) (13, 20) (13, 23) (20, 13) (20, 5) (17, 2) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 19) (22, 25) (22, 19) (22, 14) (1, 17) (1, 23) (4, 25) (4, 10) (4, 27) (27, 10) (27, 8) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 26) (18, 26) (18, 24) (26, 3) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 28) (21, 29) (21, 8) (21, 24) (28, 26) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 24) (23, 25) (23, 11) (23, 13) (23, 1) (23, 12) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 8) (16, 6) (19, 17) (19, 22) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 12) (5, 8) (5, 20) (7, 27) (12, 28) (12, 23) (12, 14) (24, 17) (24, 18) (24, 21) (24, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <2, 29, 17, 2>
- Cycle 2: <3, 25, 22, 19, 17, 2, 11, 10, 3>
- Cycle 3: <6, 9, 6>
- Cycle 4: <6, 10, 11, 2, 29, 0, 25, 3, 26, 18, 24, 21, 8, 27, 4, 10>
- Cycle 5: <8, 5, 20, 13, 23, 12, 28, 26, 18, 24, 21, 8>
- Cycle 6: <27, 26, 3, 25, 0, 8, 21, 24, 28, 26>
- Cycle 7: <27, 26, 28, 12, 14, 22, 25, 4, 10, 11, 23, 1, 17, 29, 21, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (2, 17)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (25, 22)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (11, 29)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (5, 20)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (26, 28)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are 2 chordless cycles: Cycle 3 and Cycle 7.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
