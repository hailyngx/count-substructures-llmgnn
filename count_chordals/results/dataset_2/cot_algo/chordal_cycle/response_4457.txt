Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 2) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles:
- Cycle 1: {4, 8, 7, 5, 4}
- Cycle 2: {4, 9, 10, 2, 4}
- Cycle 3: {4, 0, 10, 2, 4}
- Cycle 4: {4, 1, 5, 1, 4}
- Cycle 5: {7, 8, 1, 5, 7}
- Cycle 6: {7, 5, 6, 11, 7}
- Cycle 7: {7, 13, 3, 6, 7}
- Cycle 8: {10, 0, 4, 8, 10}
- Cycle 9: {10, 1, 5, 3, 10}
- Cycle 10: {10, 2, 12, 6, 10}
- Cycle 11: {10, 9, 11, 6, 10}
- Cycle 12: {11, 10, 0, 4, 11}
- Cycle 13: {11, 9, 14, 2, 11}
- Cycle 14: {8, 4, 0, 10, 8}
- Cycle 15: {8, 7, 6, 11, 8}
- Cycle 16: {8, 1, 5, 3, 8}
- Cycle 17: {5, 7, 6, 3, 5}
- Cycle 18: {5, 10, 2, 12, 5}
- Cycle 19: {5, 1, 4, 9, 5}
- Cycle 20: {6, 7, 13, 3, 6}
- Cycle 21: {6, 11, 9, 14, 6}
- Cycle 22: {6, 5, 1, 4, 6}
- Cycle 23: {6, 3, 13, 7, 6}
- Cycle 24: {6, 12, 2, 14, 6}
- Cycle 25: {2, 10, 9, 14, 2}
- Cycle 26: {2, 12, 6, 11, 2}
- Cycle 27: {12, 11, 9, 14, 12}
- Cycle 28: {0, 4, 9, 10, 0}
- Cycle 29: {0, 10, 2, 14, 0}
- Cycle 30: {0, 1, 5, 10, 0}
- Cycle 31: {3, 5, 1, 8, 3}
- Cycle 32: {3, 6, 11, 9, 3}
- Cycle 33: {3, 13, 7, 6, 3}
- Cycle 34: {14, 2, 10, 0, 14}
- Cycle 35: {14, 9, 4, 1, 14}
- Cycle 36: {14, 13, 7, 5, 14}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 8, 5, 7, 1>
- <4, 9, 10, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 8, 10, 0>
- <6, 11, 9, 14, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since all cycles identified have a chord, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
