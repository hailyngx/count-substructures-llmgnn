Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- We can identify the following cycles of length 4 or more:
1. Cycle 1: 0-1-4-3-0
2. Cycle 2: 0-1-4-8-0
3. Cycle 3: 0-1-4-6-3-0
4. Cycle 4: 0-3-4-6-0
5. Cycle 5: 0-3-4-8-0
6. Cycle 6: 0-3-6-4-1-0
7. Cycle 7: 0-3-6-4-8-0
8. Cycle 8: 0-3-6-4-1-4-0

Step 2: 
- We check each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 1 has no chord.
2. Cycle 2 has no chord.
3. Cycle 3 has one chord: (4, 6).
4. Cycle 4 has one chord: (4, 8).
5. Cycle 5 has one chord: (4, 8).
6. Cycle 6 has one chord: (3, 4).
7. Cycle 7 has one chord: (3, 4).
8. Cycle 8 has one chord: (3, 4).

Step 3:
- Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, 1, 4, 6> with chord (4, 6)
2. <0, 1, 4, 8> with chord (4, 8)
3. <0, 3, 4, 6> with chord (4, 6)
4. <0, 3, 4, 8> with chord (4, 8)
5. <0, 3, 6, 4> with chord (3, 4)
