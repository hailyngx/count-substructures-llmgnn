Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2)

        - Cycle 1: 0-5-1-4-8-7-3-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-5-1-9-6-0
        - Cycle 3: 0-5-2-3-7-0
        - Cycle 4: 0-5-2-7-8-0
        - Cycle 5: 0-6-9-8-7-0
        - Cycle 6: 1-5-2-3-0-1
        - Cycle 7: 1-5-9-6-0-1
        - Cycle 8: 1-9-8-7-0-1
        - Cycle 9: 2-5-9-1-4-2
        - Cycle 10: 2-7-3-0-5-2
        - Cycle 11: 3-2-5-0-7-3
        - Cycle 12: 3-7-8-4-1-5-3
        - Cycle 13: 3-7-8-9-1-5-3
        - Cycle 14: 4-1-9-8-7-3-0-4
        - Cycle 15: 4-8-7-3-0-5-1-4
        - Cycle 16: 5-0-6-9-1-4-8-7-5
        - Cycle 17: 5-1-9-8-7-3-0-5
        - Cycle 18: 5-2-7-8-9-1-0-5
        - Cycle 19: 6-0-5-1-9-8-7-6
        - Cycle 20: 7-0-5-2-3-7
        - Cycle 21: 8-4-1-5-2-3-7-8
        - Cycle 22: 8-7-0-5-1-9-8
        - Cycle 23: 9-1-5-0-7-8-9
        - Cycle 24: 9-6-0-5-1-4-9

    Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (5, 1), 8, (4, 7)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (5, 9), 1, (6, 0)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (5, 2), 7, (3, 0)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, (5, 2), 7, (8, 0)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (6, 9), 8, (7, 0)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (5, 2), 3, (0, 1)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, (5, 9), 0, (6, 1)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, (9, 8), 7, (0, 1)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <2, (5, 9), 1, (4, 2)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <2, (7, 3), 5, (0, 2)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <3, (2, 5), 0, (7, 3)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <3, (7, 8), 1, (5, 3)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <3, (7, 8), 1, (9, 5)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 14: <4, (1, 9), 8, (7, 4)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 15: <4, (8, 7), 0, (5, 4)> 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 16: <0, (5, 6), 1, (9, 8), 7, (3, 0), 4> (multiple chords)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 17: <1, (5, 9), 8, (7, 0), 5, (1, 4)> (multiple chords)

    Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 15 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, and thus the number of chordless cycles is [9].
