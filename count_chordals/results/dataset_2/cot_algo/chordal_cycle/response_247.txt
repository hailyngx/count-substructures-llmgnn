Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-4-1-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-9-4-2-5
        - Cycle 3: 5-9-4-7-5
        - Cycle 4: 5-9-2-4-5
        - Cycle 5: 7-4-9-5-7
        - Cycle 6: 7-4-1-3-7
        - Cycle 7: 7-4-2-1-7
        - Cycle 8: 7-4-9-8-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord 9-1
        - Cycle 2 has a chord 9-2
        - Cycle 3 has a chord 9-7
        - Cycle 4 has a chord 9-4
        - Cycle 5 does not have exactly one chord
        - Cycle 6 does not have exactly one chord
        - Cycle 7 does not have exactly one chord
        - Cycle 8 has a chord 9-8

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
        There are [4] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <5, 9, 1, 4>
        <5, 9, 2, 4>
        <5, 9, 7, 4>
        <5, 9, 4, 7>
        <7, 4, 9, 8>
