Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 3) (1, 11) (15, 7) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 7) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (18, 9) (18, 3) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 12) (11, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (16, 19) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 19) (6, 16) (6, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 10) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 12) (2, 17) (2, 16) (12, 17) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 9, 18>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 5, 10>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 5, 14>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 9, 14>
- Cycle 5: <0, 13, 17, 12>
- Cycle 6: <0, 13, 19, 6>
- Cycle 7: <0, 5, 10, 7>
- Cycle 8: <0, 5, 14, 12>
- Cycle 9: <4, 5, 10, 7>
- Cycle 10: <4, 5, 14, 12>
- Cycle 11: <4, 9, 18, 3>
- Cycle 12: <4, 9, 14, 12>
- Cycle 13: <4, 0, 13, 17>
- Cycle 14: <4, 0, 13, 19>
- Cycle 15: <5, 10, 7, 15>
- Cycle 16: <9, 18, 3, 8>
- Cycle 17: <9, 14, 12, 17>
- Cycle 18: <13, 17, 12, 2>
- Cycle 19: <13, 17, 7, 15>
- Cycle 20: <13, 19, 6, 16>

Step 2:
- Checking for chords:
    - Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 18)
    - Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 10)
    - Cycle 3 has a chord (4, 14)
    - Cycle 4 has a chord (9, 14)
    - Cycle 5 has a chord (13, 17)
    - Cycle 6 has a chord (13, 19)
    - Cycle 7 has a chord (5, 10)
    - Cycle 8 has a chord (5, 14)
    - Cycle 9 has a chord (4, 7)
    - Cycle 10 has a chord (4, 12)
    - Cycle 11 has a chord (9, 3)
    - Cycle 12 has a chord (9, 12)
    - Cycle 13 has a chord (0, 17)
    - Cycle 14 has a chord (0, 19)
    - Cycle 15 has a chord (10, 7)
    - Cycle 16 has a chord (18, 3)
    - Cycle 17 has a chord (14, 17)
    - Cycle 18 has a chord (17, 2)
    - Cycle 19 has a chord (17, 15)
    - Cycle 20 has a chord (13, 16)

Step 3:
- Counting chordal 4-cycles: [20]
