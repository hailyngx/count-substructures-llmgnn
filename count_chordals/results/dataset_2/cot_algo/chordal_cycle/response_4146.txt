Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 12) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 12) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (1, 9, 13, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 4, 1, 10, 2)
- Cycle 3: (3, 0, 13, 4, 3)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 6, 14, 5)
- Cycle 5: (8, 9, 13, 0, 8)
- Cycle 6: (10, 2, 14, 6, 10)
- Cycle 7: (11, 5, 14, 2, 11)
- Cycle 8: (12, 0, 13, 4, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (1, 10)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (0, 13)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (9, 0)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (2, 14)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (5, 2)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (0, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the final answer is [0], indicating that there are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
