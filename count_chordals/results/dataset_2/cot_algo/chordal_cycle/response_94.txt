Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 28) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 16) (0, 27) (0, 9) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 21) (20, 29) (20, 12) (20, 19) (20, 23) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 24) (22, 15) (22, 26) (22, 19) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 14) (11, 2) (11, 28) (28, 15) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 18) (24, 27) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 17) (4, 6) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 25) (5, 10) (19, 20) (19, 22) (19, 5) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 12) (14, 26) (14, 3) (14, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (17, 2) (17, 24) (17, 6) (7, 9) (3, 14) (12, 20) (12, 23) (12, 21) (12, 9) (16, 27) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 10) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 9) (18, 28) (18, 1) (18, 21) (18, 13) (25, 15) (25, 5) (21, 29) (21, 12) (21, 18) (13, 18) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 
- Cycle 1: (27, 0, 9, 7)
- Cycle 2: (2, 29, 20, 12, 9)
- Cycle 3: (8, 28, 11, 2, 29)
- Cycle 4: (22, 26, 14, 3)
- Cycle 5: (5, 19, 22, 26)
- Cycle 6: (6, 4, 6)
- Cycle 7: (17, 2, 29, 20)
- Cycle 8: (16, 27, 0, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Only Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (0, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There is [0] chordal 4-cycle found.

Unique Chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (0, 9), 7>
