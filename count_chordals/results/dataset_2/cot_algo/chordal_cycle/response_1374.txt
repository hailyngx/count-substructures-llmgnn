Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 13) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 5, 0, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 5, 12, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 11, 12, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 10, 12, 5, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 5, 12, 1, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 5, 0, 1, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 11, 12, 5, 3)
- Cycle 8: (10, 11, 6, 7, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (3, 1)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (3, 1)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (3, 5)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (11, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 4 chordless cycles found: Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, and Cycle 4.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, 3, 5, 0>
- <1, 3, 5, 12>
- <1, 3, 11, 12>
- <1, 10, 12, 5>
