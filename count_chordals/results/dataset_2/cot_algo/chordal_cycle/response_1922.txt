Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-7-4-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-2-10-14-11-5-1
- Cycle 3: 0-4-9-3-0
- Cycle 4: 7-11-5-6-7
- Cycle 5: 9-4-0-13-9
- Cycle 6: 13-0-14-7-13

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (3, 14), 5)>
- <4, (9, 0), 3)>
- <7, (11, 5), 6)>
- <0, (13, 9), 4)>
- <13, (7, 0), 6)>

Step 3:
As we have found 5 unique chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [5].
