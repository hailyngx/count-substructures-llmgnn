        - <1, 9, 11, 3> with chords (1, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 3> with chords (9, 3)
        - <1, 9, 11, 3> with chords (1, 3)
        - <1, 9, 11, 3> with chords (9, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 3> with chords (9, 3)
        - <1, 9, 11, 3> with chords (11, 3)
        - <1, 9, 11, 10> with chords (1, 11)

        - <1, 9, 11, 10> with chords (1, 10)
        - <1, 9, 11, 10> with chords (9, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 10> with chords (9, 10)
        - <1, 9, 11, 10> with chords (11, 10)
        - <1, 9, 11, 4> with chords (1, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 4> with chords (9, 4)
        - <1, 9, 11, 4> with chords (1, 4)
        - <1, 9, 11, 4> with chords (9, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 4> with chords (9, 4)
        - <1, 9, 11, 4> with chords (11, 4)
        - <1, 9, 11, 2> with chords (1, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 2> with chords (9, 2)
        - <1, 9, 11, 2> with chords (1, 2)
        - <1, 9, 11, 2> with chords (9, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 2> with chords (9, 2)
        - <1, 9, 11, 2> with chords (11, 2)
        - <1, 9, 11, 10, 2> with chords (1, 10)
        - <1, 9, 11, 10, 2> with chords (9, 2)
        - <1, 9, 11, 10, 2> with chords (1, 2)
        - <1, 9, 11, 10, 2> with chords (9, 10)
        - <1, 9, 11, 10, 2> with chords (9, 2)
        - <1, 9, 11, 10, 2> with chords (11, 10)
        - <1, 9, 11, 10, 2> with chords (10, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, 9, 7, 13> with chord (1, 13)
        - <1, 9, 11, 12> with chord (1, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 14> with chord (1, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 8> with chord (1, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 3> with chord (1, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 10> with chord (1, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 4> with chord (1, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 2> with chord (1, 11)
        - <1, 9, 11, 10, 2> with chord (1, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        As we found 9 unique chordal 4-cycles, the number of chordless cycles is [9].
