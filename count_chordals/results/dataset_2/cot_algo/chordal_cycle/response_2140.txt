Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 19) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 13) (2, 10) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 11) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 0) (16, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 2) (5, 3) (5, 18) (12, 18) (12, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 13, 6, 1, 16, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 4, 13, 2, 10, 6, 1, 16, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 7, 1, 6, 10, 2, 13, 4, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 8, 17, 15, 1, 6, 13, 4, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 11, 14, 16, 1, 6, 13, 4, 0)
- Cycle 6: (1, 7, 0, 16, 14, 11, 12, 18, 5, 3, 15, 17, 8, 0)
- Cycle 7: (1, 6, 13, 19, 8, 17, 15, 3, 5, 18, 12, 11, 14, 16, 1)
- Cycle 8: (2, 13, 4, 0, 16, 14, 11, 12, 18, 17, 15, 1, 6, 10, 2)
- Cycle 9: (3, 5, 18, 12, 11, 14, 16, 0, 4, 13, 2, 10, 6, 1, 15, 17, 8, 19, 13, 6, 9, 10, 2, 13, 19, 8)
- Cycle 10: (4, 0, 16, 14, 11, 12, 18, 17, 15, 1, 6, 13, 2, 10, 9, 6, 1, 7, 0)
- Cycle 11: (6, 1, 15, 17, 18, 12, 11, 14, 16, 0, 4, 13, 2, 10, 6)
- Cycle 12: (13, 4, 0, 7, 1, 15, 17, 18, 12, 11, 14, 16, 6, 1, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (6, 13), 16, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (10, 6), 1, 16, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, (6, 1), 15, 17, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (13, 2), 10, 6, 1, 16, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (3, 18), 12, 11, 14, 16, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (1, 15), 17, 18, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (0, 16), 14, 11, 12, 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <9, (10, 6), 1, 15, 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <10, (2, 13), 4, 0, 16, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <11, (12, 11), 14, 16, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <13, (4, 0), 16, 14, 11, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <17, (15, 1), 6, 13, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]
