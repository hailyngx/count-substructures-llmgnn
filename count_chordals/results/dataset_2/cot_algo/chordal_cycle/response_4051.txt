Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 15) (1, 11) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 8) (14, 7) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 11) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 13) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 16) (12, 4) (12, 5) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (16, 2) (16, 17) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 18) (13, 15) (6, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 4-7-3-2-4
- Cycle 2: 4-7-3-9-4
- Cycle 3: 4-7-3-2-18-4
- Cycle 4: 4-7-3-9-16-4
- Cycle 5: 4-12-5-18-4
- Cycle 6: 4-12-5-11-1-4
- Cycle 7: 4-15-1-11-17-4
- Cycle 8: 4-15-1-11-19-4
- Cycle 9: 7-3-2-18-5-7
- Cycle 10: 7-3-9-8-5-7
- Cycle 11: 7-3-9-16-10-7
- Cycle 12: 7-14-7
- Cycle 13: 3-2-18-5-12-3
- Cycle 14: 3-9-8-5-12-3
- Cycle 15: 3-9-16-10-4-3
- Cycle 16: 2-18-5-12-4-2
- Cycle 17: 2-18-5-11-1-2
- Cycle 18: 2-18-5-11-19-2
- Cycle 19: 2-8-5-12-4-2
- Cycle 20: 2-8-9-16-10-2
- Cycle 21: 18-5-11-1-4-18
- Cycle 22: 18-5-11-19-4-18
- Cycle 23: 18-5-12-4-8-18
- Cycle 24: 18-5-12-5
- Cycle 25: 18-17-11-1-4-18
- Cycle 26: 18-17-11-19-4-18
- Cycle 27: 18-17-16-10-4-18
- Cycle 28: 15-1-11-17-4-15
- Cycle 29: 15-1-11-19-4-15
- Cycle 30: 15-13-18-5-12-15
- Cycle 31: 11-1-15-13-11
- Cycle 32: 11-1-4-12-5-11
- Cycle 33: 11-17-16-10-4-11
- Cycle 34: 11-19-4-12-5-11
- Cycle 35: 5-11-1-15-13-5
- Cycle 36: 5-11-17-16-10-5
- Cycle 37: 16-9-8-5-12-16
- Cycle 38: 16-9-3-7-14-16

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

From the cycles above, we find the following chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, (2, 18), 5, (11, 1)>
- <4, (2, 18), 5, (11, 19)>
- <4, (5, 12), 5, (10, 16)>
- <2, (11, 1), 5, (13, 15)>
- <11, (1, 15), 13, (5, 12)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
