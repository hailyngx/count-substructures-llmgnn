Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle <5, 4, 7, 1>
- Cycle <5, 3, 1, 9>
- Cycle <5, 9, 2, 3>
- Cycle <4, 7, 1, 14>
- Cycle <4, 0, 6, 7>
- Cycle <4, 14, 11, 10>
- Cycle <7, 1, 9, 2>
- Cycle <1, 14, 11, 10>
- Cycle <1, 12, 6, 7>
- Cycle <3, 10, 11, 8>
- Cycle <3, 5, 9, 2>
- Cycle <10, 11, 8, 9>
- Cycle <11, 14, 6, 0>
- Cycle <8, 11, 4, 7>
- Cycle <0, 13, 6, 7>
- Cycle <6, 14, 1, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal cycle found: <5, 4, 7, 1> with chord (5, 1) or (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
