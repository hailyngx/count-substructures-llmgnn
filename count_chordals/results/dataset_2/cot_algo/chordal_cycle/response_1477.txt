Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 17) (18, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 2) (13, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (6, 16) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 19) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 19) (9, 18) (9, 0) (12, 11) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 17) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <11, 16, 15, 6>
- <11, 16, 2, 3>
- <11, 5, 4, 3>
- <11, 5, 17, 8>
- <16, 15, 6, 8>
- <16, 2, 3, 15>
- <16, 2, 13, 1>
- <3, 15, 6, 8>
- <3, 4, 5, 1>
- <5, 11, 12, 6>
- <5, 4, 3, 15>
- <5, 17, 7, 19>
- <13, 2, 16, 15>
- <8, 14, 7, 19>
- <8, 10, 0, 19>
- <19, 7, 17, 5>
- <1, 13, 2, 11>
- <6, 16, 2, 13>
- <6, 15, 3, 4>
- <6, 8, 17, 2>
- <0, 19, 7, 17>
- <0, 10, 8, 14>
- <10, 8, 17, 5>
- <14, 7, 17, 2>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <11, 16, 15, 6> (Chord: (16, 15))
- <11, 5, 17, 8> (Chord: (5, 17))
- <16, 2, 13, 1> (Chord: (2, 13))
- <3, 4, 5, 1> (Chord: (3, 5))
- <5, 11, 12, 6> (Chord: (11, 12))
- <13, 2, 16, 15> (Chord: (2, 16))
- <8, 14, 7, 19> (Chord: (14, 7))
- <19, 7, 17, 5> (Chord: (7, 17))
- <1, 13, 2, 11> (Chord: (13, 11))
- <14, 7, 17, 2> (Chord: (7, 17))

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <11, 16, 15, 6>
- <11, 5, 17, 8>
- <16, 2, 13, 1>
- <3, 4, 5, 1>
- <5, 11, 12, 6>
- <13, 2, 16, 15>
- <8, 14, 7, 19>
- <19, 7, 17, 5>
- <1, 13, 2, 11>
- <14, 7, 17, 2>
