Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-6-2-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-9-6-4-5
        - Cycle 3: 5-9-7-9-5
        - Cycle 4: 5-9-7-9-6
        - Cycle 5: 5-6-2-8-5
        - Cycle 6: 5-6-4-2-5
        - Cycle 7: 5-6-4-3-5
        - Cycle 8: 5-6-4-0-5
        - Cycle 9: 5-1-2-8-5
        - Cycle 10: 5-1-4-2-5
        - Cycle 11: 5-1-4-3-5
        - Cycle 12: 5-1-4-0-5
        - Cycle 13: 5-0-4-2-5
        - Cycle 14: 5-0-4-3-5
        - Cycle 15: 9-7-9-6-5
        - Cycle 16: 6-4-0-5-6
        - Cycle 17: 1-4-0-5-1

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - <1, (2, 5), 4>
        - <2, (4, 6), 3>
        - <5, (7, 9), 6>
        - <5, (7, 9), 9>
        - <2, (4, 8), 6>
        - <3, (4, 6), 5>
        - <3, (2, 4), 5>
        - <4, (0, 6), 5>
        - <1, (2, 8), 5>
        - <1, (2, 5), 4>
        - <1, (3, 5), 4>
        - <1, (3, 5), 0>
        - <4, (0, 2), 5>
        - <4, (0, 3), 5>
        - <9, (6, 7), 5>
        - <6, (0, 5), 4>
        - <1, (0, 4), 5>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
