Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 6 - 4 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 7 - 3 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 3: 9 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 4: 7 - 6 - 4 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 5: 8 - 6 - 4 - 1 - 8
- Cycle 6: 0 - 5 - 7 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 7: 0 - 8 - 1 - 3 - 0

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (7, 3)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (6, 2)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (6, 1)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (8, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are 4 chordless cycles found. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <5, 7, 3, 1, 5>
2. <9, 2, 1, 4, 9>
3. <7, 6, 4, 2, 7>
4. <0, 8, 1, 3, 0>
