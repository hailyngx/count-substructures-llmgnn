Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- One cycle of length 4: (3, 1, 2, 7, 3)
- Another cycle of length 4: (4, 3, 7, 6, 4)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
1. Cycle (3, 1, 2, 7, 3):
    - Adding chord (1, 7) results in a chordal 4-cycle: <(1, 7), (2, 3)>
    
2. Cycle (4, 3, 7, 6, 4):
    - Adding chord (3, 7) results in a chordal 4-cycle: <(3, 7), (4, 6)>

Step 3:
Total number of unique chordal 4-cycles found = [2]
