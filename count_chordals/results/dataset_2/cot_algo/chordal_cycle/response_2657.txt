Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (8)>
- <2, (22)>
- <3, (13)>
- <4, (24)>
- <5, (19)>
- <6, (15)>
- <7, (7)>
- <8, (26)>
- <9, (13)>
- <10, (13)>
- <11, (3)>
- <12, (15)>
- <13, (15)>
- <14, (6)>
- <15, (29)>
- <16, (29)>
- <17, (29)>
- <18, (15)>
- <19, (13)>
- <20, (27)>
- <21, (16)>
- <22, (4)>
- <23, (22)>
- <24, (25)>
- <25, (23)>
- <26, (1)>
- <27, (21)>
- <28, (7)>
- <29, (13)>
- <30, (19)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
There are 30 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [30].
