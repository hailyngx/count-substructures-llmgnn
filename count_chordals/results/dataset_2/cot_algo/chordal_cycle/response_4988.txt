Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 4) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 9) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 21) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 27) (4, 25) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 28) (21, 17) (21, 28) (21, 23) (28, 14) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 26) (26, 28) (26, 23) (27, 17) (27, 4) (27, 18) (5, 22) (5, 19) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 5) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (16, 29) (16, 6) (23, 21) (23, 26) (23, 18) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 20) (1, 13) (1, 29) (1, 20) (29, 16) (29, 1) (29, 25) (6, 14) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 17) (24, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (20, 3) (20, 10) (20, 1) (18, 3) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 23) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 7) (11, 13) (11, 22) (11, 12) (12, 0) (12, 11) (25, 4) (25, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<1, 13, 22, 5>  
<1, 13, 9, 14>  
<1, 13, 9, 7>  
<1, 13, 19, 5>  
<1, 20, 3, 22>  
<1, 20, 10, 7>  
<1, 20, 10, 2>  
<1, 29, 16, 6>  
<1, 29, 25, 4>  
<3, 22, 13, 11>  
<3, 22, 5, 19>  
<3, 15, 4, 27>  
<3, 20, 1, 13>  
<3, 20, 10, 7>  
<3, 20, 10, 2>  
<4, 15, 3, 20>  
<4, 15, 3, 18>  
<4, 15, 27, 17>

<5, 22, 3, 20>  
<5, 19, 13, 1>  
<5, 19, 8, 4>  
<5, 19, 8, 28>  
<6, 16, 29, 25>  
<6, 24, 17, 27>  
<6, 24, 17, 21>  
<6, 14, 9, 13>  
<6, 14, 28, 21>  

Step 2: 
<1, 13, 22, 5>  
<1, 13, 9, 14>  
<1, 13, 19, 5>  
<1, 20, 3, 22>  
<1, 29, 16, 6>  
<3, 22, 13, 11>

<6, 16, 29, 25>  
<6, 24, 17, 27>  

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is 15.
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
