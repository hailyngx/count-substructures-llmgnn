Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 14) (29, 2) (29, 26) (3, 25) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 15) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 27) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 13) (19, 13) (26, 29) (26, 8) (26, 4) (26, 17) (16, 4) (16, 5) (16, 15) (28, 4) (28, 18) (5, 16) (5, 14) (11, 18) (11, 8) (23, 24) (20, 7) (20, 14) (4, 26) (4, 16) (4, 28) (12, 24) (12, 22) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 22) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 26) (17, 7) (17, 21) (1, 25) (1, 9) (1, 10) (0, 18) (0, 8) (15, 25) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 22) (21, 17) (21, 24) (13, 9) (13, 19) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 21) (24, 18) (24, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 20) (14, 27) (27, 6) (27, 14) (27, 10) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 27) (22, 6) (22, 12) (22, 7) (22, 15) (18, 28) (18, 11) (18, 0) (18, 24) (8, 26) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- From the given list of edges, we can identify the following cycles of length 4 or more: 
1. Cycle 1: 2-29-26-4-2
2. Cycle 2: 3-25-7-17-6-3
3. Cycle 3: 3-25-15-22-6-3
4. Cycle 4: 3-6-17-26-29-2-14-5-16-4-28-18-24-10-1-9-13-19-13-9-6

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 1: <2, (4, 26), 29>
2. Cycle 2: <3, (7, 17), 25>
3. Cycle 3: <3, (15, 22), 25>
4. Cycle 4: This cycle already contains multiple chords and does not qualify as a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <2, (4, 26), 29>
2. <3, (7, 17), 25>
3. <3, (15, 22), 25>
