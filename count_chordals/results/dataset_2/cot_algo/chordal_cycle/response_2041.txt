Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (9, 16) (9, 19) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 17) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 7) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 18) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 18) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 11) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 19) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 10, 1, 8, 4, 11, 6, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 6, 11, 17, 15, 12, 8, 4, 13, 14, 13, 1, 10, 7, 2, 5, 18, 0, 8, 1, 10, 7, 19, 9, 16, 2, 18, 16, 12, 15, 17, 11, 4, 8, 12, 19, 7, 10, 3)
- Cycle 3: (15, 17, 11, 4, 13, 14, 13, 1, 10, 7, 2, 5, 18, 0, 8, 1, 10, 7, 19, 9, 16, 2, 18, 6, 11, 4, 17, 15)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has multiple chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle is:
<1, (4, 17), 11, 6>
