This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (20, 25) (20, 18) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 15) (25, 12) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 26) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 24) (28, 21) (28, 13) (13, 25) (13, 28) (13, 26) (26, 21) (26, 13) (26, 24) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 12) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 5) (24, 3) (24, 26) (24, 11) (15, 25) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 2) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 10) (10, 15) (10, 16) (10, 2) (9, 29) (9, 23) (9, 12) (29, 27) (29, 9) (0, 16) (0, 22) (6, 21) (6, 23) (6, 8) (18, 20) (18, 27) (18, 19) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 18) (5, 27) (5, 8) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 5) (22, 27) (22, 16) (22, 0) (22, 12) (23, 9) (23, 6) (2, 7) (2, 15) (2, 10) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 9) (12, 22) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. (4, 1, 3, 11)
2. (4, 1, 3, 24)
3. (4, 1, 3, 11, 19)
4. (4, 1, 3, 24, 26)
5. (4, 1, 3, 11, 12)
6. (4, 1, 3, 24, 11)
7. (4, 1, 3, 11, 19)
8. (4, 1, 3, 11, 12, 9)
9. (4, 1, 3, 24, 11, 12)
10. (7, 2, 15, 16)
11. (7, 2, 15, 10)
12. (7, 2, 10, 16)
13. (17, 14, 8, 6)
14. (17, 14, 8, 5)
15. (17, 19, 11, 3)
16. (17, 19, 11, 12)
17. (17, 19, 18, 27)
18. (20, 25, 13, 28)
19. (20, 18, 19, 4)
20. (20, 18, 27, 22)
21. (25, 20, 18, 19)
22. (25, 13, 26, 21)
23. (25, 15, 2, 7)
24. (25, 15, 10, 2)
25. (25, 12, 11, 3)
26. (21, 28, 13, 26)
27. (21, 26, 24, 11)
28. (1, 3, 24, 26)
29. (3, 11, 12, 9)
30. (3, 24, 11, 12)

Step 2:
From the above cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
1. <1, 3, 11, 12> (Chord: (3, 11))

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [29].
