Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 19) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 1) (8, 2) (15, 10) (15, 19) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 4) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 17) (7, 3) (17, 2) (17, 16) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 9) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 18) (13, 10) (13, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 7, 19>
- Cycle 2: <10, 15, 19, 3>
- Cycle 3: <10, 15, 19, 4>
- Cycle 4: <11, 2, 14, 4>
- Cycle 5: <11, 2, 8, 1>
- Cycle 6: <11, 2, 8, 2>
- Cycle 7: <5, 11, 2, 8>
- Cycle 8: <5, 11, 2, 14>
- Cycle 9: <5, 11, 12, 6>
- Cycle 10: <5, 18, 17, 2>
- Cycle 11: <6, 12, 11, 2>
- Cycle 12: <6, 12, 18, 17>
- Cycle 13: <6, 18, 17, 16>
- Cycle 14: <0, 14, 2, 8>
- Cycle 15: <0, 14, 2, 11>
- Cycle 16: <0, 14, 4, 9>
- Cycle 17: <13, 10, 15, 19>
- Cycle 18: <13, 16, 17, 18>
- Cycle 19: <16, 1, 8, 2>
- Cycle 20: <16, 1, 9, 18>
- Cycle 21: <16, 13, 10, 15>
- Cycle 22: <16, 17, 2, 11>
- Cycle 23: <16, 17, 18, 5>
- Cycle 24: <19, 3, 1, 8>
- Cycle 25: <19, 3, 7, 3>
- Cycle 26: <19, 4, 9, 18>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Only Cycle 9: <5, 11, 12, 6> has exactly one chord <11, 6>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the number inside brackets is [1].
