Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 19) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 17) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 12) (12, 19) (12, 10) (12, 11) (16, 4) (16, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (10, 2) (10, 12) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 11) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (14, 9) (14, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Possible cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-13-6-9-5
- Cycle 2: 4-13-6-9-4
- Cycle 3: 4-13-16-4
- Cycle 4: 4-3-7-17-4
- Cycle 5: 1-5-13-16-1
- Cycle 6: 1-15-7-3-1
- Cycle 7: 1-5-17-0-1
- Cycle 8: 1-19-8-9-1
- Cycle 9: 1-19-12-11-1
- Cycle 10: 1-5-17-7-1
- Cycle 11: 1-15-14-9-1
- Cycle 12: 12-19-1-5-12
- Cycle 13: 12-19-8-9-12
- Cycle 14: 12-19-1-15-12
- Cycle 15: 12-19-8-19-12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (5, 13), 16>
- <4, (13, 6), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [2].
