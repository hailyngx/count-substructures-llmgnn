Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 14) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 8, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 2: (5, 6, 3, 9, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 3: (5, 2, 8, 6, 5)  
- Cycle 4: (5, 2, 9, 3, 6, 5)  
- Cycle 5: (5, 2, 1, 9, 3, 6, 5)  
- Cycle 6: (5, 10, 0, 9, 1, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 7: (5, 7, 4, 11, 1, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 8: (5, 7, 13, 12, 9, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 9: (5, 7, 13, 11, 1, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 10: (5, 7, 0, 10, 0, 9, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 11: (5, 7, 4, 0, 9, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 12: (5, 7, 0, 4, 11, 1, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 13: (5, 7, 4, 1, 9, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 14: (5, 7, 13, 12, 1, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 15: (5, 7, 13, 11, 4, 0, 9, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 16: (5, 7, 0, 4, 7, 13, 11, 1, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 17: (5, 7, 4, 0, 10, 5)  
- Cycle 18: (5, 7, 13, 12, 9, 0, 4, 1, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 19: (5, 7, 13, 12, 1, 11, 4, 0, 9, 2, 5)  
- Cycle 20: (5, 7, 0, 4, 1, 2, 9, 3, 6, 5)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<8, (6, 3)>  
<10, (4, 11)>  
<19, (1, 11)>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [17].
