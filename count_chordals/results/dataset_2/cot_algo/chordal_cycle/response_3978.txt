Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 using the given edges:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 1, 3, 4)
- Cycle 3: (6, 8, 1, 3, 6)
- Cycle 4: (13, 3, 1, 8, 13)
- Cycle 5: (6, 0, 3, 1, 8, 6)
- Cycle 6: (2, 11, 0, 3, 13, 2)
- Cycle 7: (6, 10, 14, 9, 7, 6)
- Cycle 8: (4, 11, 2, 14, 4)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 7) -> <1, (9, 7), 2>
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (3, 1) -> <5, (3, 1), 8>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (11, 0) -> <6, (11, 0), 7>
- Cycle 7 has no chords.
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (11, 2) -> <8, (11, 2), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph are:
<1, (9, 7), 2>
<5, (3, 1), 8>
<6, (11, 0), 7>
<8, (11, 2), 14>
