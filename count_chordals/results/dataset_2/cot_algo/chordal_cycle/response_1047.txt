Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 10) (22, 7) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 28) (27, 0) (27, 21) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 9) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 29) (18, 1) (7, 22) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 25) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 26) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 24) (26, 4) (26, 25) (26, 16) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 21) (19, 4) (19, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 21) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 18) (1, 14) (1, 29) (3, 2) (3, 28) (3, 23) (28, 15) (28, 0) (28, 3) (28, 10) (28, 20) (29, 18) (29, 1) (21, 27) (21, 5) (21, 8) (21, 20) (21, 11) (20, 28) (20, 21) (16, 26) (16, 8) (16, 9) (24, 14) (24, 25) (25, 12) (25, 26) (25, 24) (17, 18) (17, 4) (23, 9) (23, 3) (23, 10) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 23) (11, 8) (11, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (22, 13, 27, 0, 22)
- Cycle 2: (15, 9, 0, 28, 15)
- Cycle 3: (2, 18, 4, 22, 2)
- Cycle 4: (18, 4, 26, 16, 18)
- Cycle 5: (18, 17, 4, 19, 18)
- Cycle 6: (7, 2, 18, 4, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 5, 19, 4, 7)
- Cycle 8: (9, 15, 14, 1, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 16, 26, 4, 9)
- Cycle 10: (28, 15, 14, 1, 28)
- Cycle 11: (28, 0, 27, 21, 28)
- Cycle 12: (28, 3, 2, 18, 28)
- Cycle 13: (21, 27, 0, 28, 21)
- Cycle 14: (21, 5, 19, 4, 21)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (5, 2), 7, 4> with chord 5 and 2
- <9, (4, 26), 16, 15> with chord 4 and 26
- <18, (7, 4), 22, 2> with chord 7 and 4
- <21, (19, 5), 4, 7> with chord 19 and 5

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:

- <1, (5, 2), 7, 4>
- <9, (4, 26), 16, 15>
- <18, (7, 4), 22, 2>
- <21, (19, 5), 4, 7>
