Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 7) (1, 7) (21, 15) (21, 16) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 28) (13, 14) (20, 15) (20, 22) (4, 23) (4, 5) (4, 29) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 25) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 17) (28, 13) (28, 11) (28, 24) (29, 4) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 0) (9, 29) (9, 14) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 26) (10, 7) (0, 29) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 21) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 14) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 22) (25, 18) (26, 8) (26, 29) (26, 10) (26, 2) (6, 17) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 23) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 3) (3, 0) (3, 23) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 17) (2, 13) (2, 26) (2, 19) (19, 2) (19, 7) (12, 14) (7, 27) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 19) (22, 8) (22, 20) (22, 11) (22, 17) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 16) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (15, 27, 10, 15)
- Cycle 2: (15, 20, 22, 15)
- Cycle 3: (15, 21, 16, 15)
- Cycle 4: (15, 8, 13, 15)
- Cycle 5: (15, 8, 26, 10, 15)
- Cycle 6: (15, 8, 18, 5, 4, 29, 26, 10, 15)
- Cycle 7: (15, 8, 18, 25, 18, 5, 23, 3, 0, 16, 21, 15)
- Cycle 8: (15, 8, 22, 11, 28, 13, 15)
- Cycle 9: (15, 8, 22, 17, 24, 28, 13, 15)
- Cycle 10: (15, 8, 22, 17, 24, 16, 21, 15)
- Cycle 11: (15, 8, 18, 25, 18, 5, 23, 3, 0, 29, 26, 10, 15)
- Cycle 12: (27, 10, 26, 29, 4, 23, 3, 0, 16, 21, 15, 27)
- Cycle 13: (27, 10, 26, 29, 4, 23, 3, 0, 16, 24, 28, 11, 22, 15, 27)
- Cycle 14: (27, 10, 26, 29, 4, 23, 3, 0, 16, 24, 17, 22, 15, 27)
- Cycle 15: (27, 10, 26, 29, 4, 23, 5, 18, 8, 15, 27)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (13, 15), 5>
- <2, (20, 22), 16>
- <3, (15, 21), 16>
- <4, (8, 13), 15>
- <5, (8, 26), 10>
- <6, (8, 18), 10>
- <7, (18, 25), 0>
- <8, (22, 11), 28>
- <9, (22, 17), 24>
- <10, (22, 17), 24>
- <11, (18, 25), 16>
- <12, (10, 26), 29>
- <13, (10, 26), 29>
- <14, (10, 26), 29>
- <15, (8, 18), 15>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [15].
