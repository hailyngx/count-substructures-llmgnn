Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <0, 1, 2, 5, 0>
2. Cycle <1, 3, 5, 2, 1>
3. Cycle <2, 4, 7, 6, 2>
4. Cycle <3, 4, 7, 9, 3>
5. Cycle <4, 2, 5, 0, 4>
6. Cycle <5, 3, 7, 6, 5>
7. Cycle <6, 1, 3, 8, 6>
8. Cycle <7, 4, 0, 9, 7>
9. Cycle <8, 3, 5, 2, 8>
10. Cycle <9, 6, 1, 0, 9>

Step 2:
Upon checking each cycle, we find that the following cycle has exactly one chord:
<1, 3, 5, 2, 1> with the chord (3, 2)

Step 3:
Therefore, the total number of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph is [9]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 3, 5, 2, 1> with the chord (3, 2).
