Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (22, 2) (22, 16) (22, 0) (23, 3) (23, 16) (23, 20) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 3) (12, 28) (12, 21) (12, 15) (27, 21) (2, 6) (2, 22) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 28) (18, 2) (18, 17) (15, 12) (15, 20) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 4) (20, 23) (20, 15) (20, 4) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 2) (28, 8) (28, 13) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 28) (0, 22) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 26) (7, 17) (25, 10) (25, 26) (25, 14) (3, 23) (3, 11) (3, 14) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 27) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 4) (24, 5) (24, 16) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 7) (8, 10) (8, 28) (16, 22) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 24) (14, 25) (14, 3) (14, 19) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 14) (26, 7) (26, 25) (26, 29) (29, 26) (4, 15) (4, 20) (4, 1) 

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <5, 9, 13, 15, 20>
- Cycle <10, 11, 3, 23, 20>
- Cycle <10, 11, 28, 13, 9>
- Cycle <10, 11, 28, 2, 19>
- Cycle <10, 21, 27, 21, 12>
- Cycle <10, 21, 27, 21, 27>
- Cycle <10, 21, 12, 15, 13>
- Cycle <10, 21, 12, 15, 4>
- Cycle <10, 21, 27, 21, 27>
- Cycle <11, 28, 2, 19, 14>
- Cycle <20, 23, 16, 1, 4>
- Cycle <20, 23, 3, 11, 10>
- Cycle <20, 23, 3, 14, 19>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, (9, 13), 15, 20>
- <10, 11, (3, 23), 20>
- <10, 11, (28, 13), 9>
- <10, 11, (28, 2), 19>
- <10, 21, (27, 21), 12>
- <10, 21, (27, 21), 27>
- <10, 21, 12, (15, 13)>
- <10, 21, 12, (15, 4)>
- <10, 21, (27, 21), 27>
- <11, 28, (2, 19), 14>
- <20, 23, 16, (1, 4)>
- <20, 23, 3, (11, 10)>
- <20, 23, 3, (14, 19)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
