The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (3, 26) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 28) (6, 9) (6, 22) (9, 6) (9, 27) (8, 29) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 24) (4, 3) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 2) (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 22) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 21) (20, 27) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 22) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 7) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 22) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 22) (25, 17) (25, 19) (10, 0) (10, 19) (26, 3) (26, 12) (7, 1) (7, 11) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 19) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 15) (23, 5) (23, 24) (23, 27) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 21) (21, 20) (21, 19) (21, 29) (27, 9) (27, 20) (27, 23) (24, 13) (24, 0) (24, 1) (24, 23) (24, 14) (14, 24) (29, 8) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 21) (22, 6) (22, 0) (22, 17) (22, 16) (22, 28) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 26) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 3-4-3
- Cycle 2: 15-1-15
- Cycle 3: 15-12-17-15
- Cycle 4: 6-9-6
- Cycle 5: 6-22-17-10-0-20-6
- Cycle 6: 6-22-17-12-26-8-16-6
- Cycle 7: 6-22-17-12-15-1-11-2-18-6
- Cycle 8: 6-22-17-12-15-1-11-7-21-20-6
- Cycle 9: 6-22-17-12-15-1-11-19-21-20-6
- Cycle 10: 6-22-28-16-8-29-5-23-27-6
- Cycle 11: 6-22-28-16-8-29-21-19-25-17-6
- Cycle 12: 6-22-28-15-1-11-7-29-21-19-6
- Cycle 13: 6-22-28-15-1-11-19-21-29-5-23-6

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 6 has a chord (12, 26)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (2, 18)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (7, 21)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (19, 21)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (5, 29)
- Cycle 11 has a chord (19, 25)
- Cycle 12 has a chord (7, 29)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <6, 22, 28, 16>
- <6, 22, 17, 12>
- <6, 22, 17, 15>
- <6, 22, 17, 11>
- <6, 22, 17, 21>
- <6, 22, 28, 15>
- <6, 22, 28, 1>
