Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 7) (10, 13) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (20, 4) (21, 16) (21, 26) (21, 11) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 5) (26, 22) (26, 21) (26, 7) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 12) (7, 13) (7, 22) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 26) (3, 28) (3, 23) (8, 19) (9, 17) (9, 23) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 15) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 23) (16, 21) (16, 14) (5, 28) (5, 1) (5, 14) (29, 25) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 4) (29, 18) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 29) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 24) (15, 25) (15, 23) (15, 11) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (23, 3) (23, 9) (23, 27) (23, 15) (2, 24) (4, 20) (4, 19) (4, 29) (4, 24) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 18) (11, 21) (11, 15) (24, 14) (24, 2) (24, 4) (18, 29) (18, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (7, 13, 22, 26, 7) with edges [(7, 13), (13, 22), (22, 26), (26, 7), (7, 13)]
- Cycle 2: (3, 28, 5, 1, 0, 13, 7, 26, 22, 13, 0, 1, 5, 14, 16, 21, 26, 7, 10, 17, 12, 19, 8, 4, 20, 4, 29, 25, 27, 23, 15, 11, 21, 16, 14, 5, 28, 3) with edges [(3, 28), (28, 5), (5, 1), (1, 0), (0, 13), (13, 7), (7, 26), (26, 22), (22, 13), (13, 0), (0, 1), (1, 5), (5, 14), (14, 16), (16, 21), (21, 26), (26, 7), (7, 10), (10, 17), (17, 12), (12, 19), (19, 8), (8, 4), (4, 20), (20, 4), (4, 29), (29, 25), (25, 27), (27, 23), (23, 15), (15, 11), (11, 21), (21, 16), (16, 14), (14, 5), (5, 28), (28, 3), (3, 23), (23, 27), (27, 25), (25, 29), (29, 4), (4, 20), (20, 19), (19, 12), (12, 17), (17, 10), (10, 7), (7, 13)]

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (13, 26)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (4, 19)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <7, (13, 26), 22>
- <3, (4, 19), 28, 5, 1>
