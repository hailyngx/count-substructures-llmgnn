        - Cycle 39: 7-4-9-8
        - Cycle 40: 6-7-9-8

Step 2: List of cycles with exactly one chord
        - <1, (3, 5), 9>
        - <3, (1, 5), 9>
        - <4, (6, 9), 7>
        - <5, (1, 9), 3>
        - <6, (4, 7), 9>
        - <7, (4, 6), 9>
        - <8, (2, 5), 9>
        - <9, (2, 5), 8>
        - <10, (0, 2), 9>
        - <11, (2, 7), 0>
        - <12, (0, 5), 8>
        - <13, (4, 6), 5>
        - <14, (3, 9), 5>
        - <15, (8, 9), 5>
        - <16, (1, 3), 8>

Step 3: Count of the number of chordal 4-cycles found
        There are 19 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [19].
