Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 9) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 8-2-6-5-13-8
- Cycle 2: 8-3-0-6-2-8
- Cycle 3: 8-10-14-9-7-13-8
- Cycle 4: 8-14-10-11-1-13-8
- Cycle 5: 8-14-9-7-2-6-8
- Cycle 6: 13-1-4-9-7-2-13
- Cycle 7: 10-12-7-9-4-11-10
- Cycle 8: 11-4-1-5-6-2-11

Step 2: Check each cycle for a chord:
- Cycle 1 with chord (8, 13)
- Cycle 2 with chord (3, 8)
- Cycle 3 with chord (10, 14)
- Cycle 4 with chord (11, 10)
- Cycle 5 with chord (14, 9)
- Cycle 6 with chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 7 with chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 8 with chord (6, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of [8] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<8, (8, 13), 2, 6, 5>
<3, (3, 8), 0, 6, 2>
<10, (10, 14), 11, 1, 13>
<11, (11, 10), 4, 1, 5>
<14, (14, 9), 7, 2, 6>
<4, (1, 4), 9, 7, 2>
<7, (7, 9), 12, 10, 11>
<6, (6, 5), 2, 8, 14>
