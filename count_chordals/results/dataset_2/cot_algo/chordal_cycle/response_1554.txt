Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (11, 0) (11, 9) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 7 - 13 - 2 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 4 - 12 - 8 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 3: 2 - 7 - 6 - 10 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 4: 4 - 9 - 13 - 7 - 5 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 12), 8 - 3, 1>: Cycle 2 has one chord (4, 12).
- <4, (9, 13), 7 - 5, 4>: Cycle 4 has one chord (9, 13).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (4, 12), 8 - 3, 1>
<4, (9, 13), 7 - 5, 4>
