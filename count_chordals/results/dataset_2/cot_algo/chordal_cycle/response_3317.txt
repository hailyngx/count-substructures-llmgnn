Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (7, 4, 10, 6, 7)
- Cycle 2: (7, 4, 9, 10, 6, 7)
- Cycle 3: (7, 4, 9, 10, 12, 5, 13, 7)
- Cycle 4: (7, 4, 10, 12, 5, 13, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 0, 4, 9, 10, 12, 11, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 0, 4, 9, 10, 6, 11, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 0, 4, 10, 6, 11, 7)
- Cycle 8: (7, 0, 4, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 3, 8, 2, 5, 12, 11, 7)
- Cycle 10: (7, 3, 8, 2, 13, 5, 12, 11, 7)
- Cycle 11: (7, 3, 8, 2, 13, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Only Cycle 3 <7, 4, 9, 10, 12, (5, 13), 7> has exactly one chord (5, 13).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
