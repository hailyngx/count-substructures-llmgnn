Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 15) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 16) (2, 16) (2, 3) (18, 12) (18, 19) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 15) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 16) (15, 12) (15, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 19) (16, 0) (16, 6) (16, 2) (16, 1) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <1, 4, 8, 9, 1>
2. <1, 4, 7, 11, 0, 1>
3. <1, 4, 10, 3, 2, 16, 1>
4. <1, 4, 7, 12, 0, 1>
5. <1, 4, 10, 3, 9, 14, 1>
6. <1, 0, 12, 7, 4, 1>
7. <1, 0, 12, 15, 13, 5, 6, 16, 1>
8. <1, 0, 16, 1>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1, 4, 7, 12, 0, 1> with chord (4, 8)
2. <1, 0, 12, 15, 13, 5, 6, 16, 1> with chord (12, 18)

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
