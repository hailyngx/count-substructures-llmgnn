Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 7) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (17, 19) (17, 15) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 15) (4, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 0) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 18) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 18) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 18) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 6) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 6) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 7, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 10, 0, 16>
- Cycle 3: <1, 10, 12, 8>
- Cycle 4: <3, 7, 13, 5>
- Cycle 5: <3, 7, 0, 16>
- Cycle 6: <5, 8, 12, 10>
- Cycle 7: <5, 8, 14, 13>
- Cycle 8: <5, 13, 7, 3>
- Cycle 9: <5, 13, 14, 8>
- Cycle 10: <5, 13, 6, 15>
- Cycle 11: <7, 0, 16, 5>
- Cycle 12: <7, 13, 14, 18>
- Cycle 13: <9, 7, 0, 16>
- Cycle 14: <9, 7, 13, 5>
- Cycle 15: <9, 4, 18, 11>
- Cycle 16: <9, 18, 14, 8>
- Cycle 17: <10, 12, 8, 14>
- Cycle 18: <10, 12, 8, 5>
- Cycle 19: <11, 13, 5, 16>
- Cycle 20: <11, 13, 14, 18>
- Cycle 21: <12, 8, 14, 18>
- Cycle 22: <13, 14, 18, 6>
- Cycle 23: <15, 6, 18, 9>
- Cycle 24: <15, 19, 17, 15>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- The cycles with exactly one chord are: Cycle 3, Cycle 6, Cycle 7, Cycle 9, Cycle 10, Cycle 12, Cycle 16, Cycle 17, Cycle 19, Cycle 20, Cycle 21, Cycle 22, Cycle 23

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [13].
