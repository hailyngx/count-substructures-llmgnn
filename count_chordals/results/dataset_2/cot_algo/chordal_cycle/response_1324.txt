Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 8) (9, 1) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (5, 6, 3, 0) - forming a 4-cycle
2. (5, 6, 4, 13) - forming a 4-cycle
3. (5, 7, 2, 13) - forming a 4-cycle
4. (5, 7, 12, 1) - forming a 4-cycle
5. (5, 8, 1, 9) - forming a 4-cycle
6. (6, 3, 0, 1) - forming a 4-cycle
7. (6, 4, 13, 2) - forming a 4-cycle
8. (6, 12, 1, 8) - forming a 4-cycle
9. (7, 3, 0, 1) - forming a 4-cycle
10. (7, 12, 1, 8) - forming a 4-cycle
11. (8, 1, 0, 9) - forming a 4-cycle
12. (0, 3, 5, 8) - forming a 4-cycle
13. (0, 6, 4, 13) - forming a 4-cycle
14. (0, 10, 14, 2) - forming a 4-cycle
15. (0, 11, 14, 2) - forming a 4-cycle
16. (1, 12, 6, 4) - forming a 4-cycle

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <5, (6, 3), 0>
2. <5, (7, 2), 13>
3. <5, (7, 12), 1>
4. <5, (8, 1), 9>
5. <6, (3, 0), 1>
6. <6, (4, 13), 2>
7. <6, (12, 1), 8>
8. <7, (3, 0), 1>
9. <7, (12, 1), 8>
10. <8, (1, 0), 9>
11. <0, (3, 5), 8>
12. <0, (6, 4), 13>
13. <0, (10, 14), 2>
14. <0, (11, 14), 2>
15. <1, (12, 6), 4>

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [15].
