Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 23) (9, 12) (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 6) (22, 18) (22, 10) (22, 29) (22, 3) (7, 25) (21, 0) (21, 11) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 20) (10, 29) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 12) (20, 10) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 14) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (28, 0) (28, 29) (29, 22) (29, 10) (29, 0) (29, 28) (29, 26) (4, 19) (8, 11) (8, 1) (1, 17) (1, 8) (6, 18) (6, 23) (6, 26) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 13) (25, 7) (25, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 14) (27, 20) (27, 3) (11, 21) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 25) (14, 20) (14, 13) (15, 5) (15, 26) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 15) (26, 2) (26, 16) (23, 9) (23, 18) (23, 6) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 3) (2, 26) (2, 24) (3, 22) (3, 27) (3, 16) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:  
Here are the cycles of length 4 in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 13, 17, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 23, 22, 18, 9)
- Cycle 3: (18, 6, 23, 9, 18)
- Cycle 4: (22, 10, 24, 5, 22)
- Cycle 5: (10, 20, 27, 3, 10)
- Cycle 6: (17, 1, 8, 11, 17)
- Cycle 7: (1, 8, 11, 25, 1)
- Cycle 8: (6, 23, 18, 22, 6)
- Cycle 9: (19, 17, 1, 8, 19)
- Cycle 10: (4, 19, 17, 13, 4)
- Cycle 11: (13, 9, 12, 0, 13)
- Cycle 12: (13, 19, 4, 19, 13)
- Cycle 13: (26, 29, 28, 0, 26)
- Cycle 14: (16, 17, 1, 8, 16)
- Cycle 15: (16, 26, 29, 22, 16)
- Cycle 16: (16, 3, 27, 20, 16)
- Cycle 17: (2, 26, 29, 0, 2)
- Cycle 18: (3, 16, 17, 19, 3)
- Cycle 19: (24, 5, 15, 26, 24)

Step 2:  
Checking for the cycles with exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, (13, 17), 5>
- <9, 23, (22, 18), 9>
- <22, 10, (24, 5), 22>
- <10, 20, (27, 3), 10>
- <17, 1, (8, 11), 17>
- <1, 8, (11, 25), 1>
- <6, 23, (18, 22), 6>
- <19, 17, (1, 8), 19>
- <4, 19, (17, 13), 4>
- <13, 9, (12, 0), 13>
- <26, 29, (28, 0), 26>
- <16, 17, (1, 8), 16>
- <16, 26, (29, 22), 16>
- <16, 3, (27, 20), 16>
- <2, 26, (29, 0), 2>
- <3, 16, (17, 19), 3>
- <24, 5, (15, 26), 24>

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles, so [16].
