Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: 9-1-4-5-9
- Cycle 2: 9-8-5-4-9
- Cycle 3: 9-1-0-5-9
- Cycle 4: 7-6-8-5-7
- Cycle 5: 7-8-4-3-7
- Cycle 6: 7-0-1-9-7

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has chord (8, 5).
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has chord (6, 5).
- Cycle 5 has chord (8, 4).
- Cycle 6 has no chord.

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <9, 1, 4, 5> with chord (8, 5)
- <7, 6, 8, 5> with chord (6, 5)
- <7, 8, 4, 3> with chord (8, 4)
