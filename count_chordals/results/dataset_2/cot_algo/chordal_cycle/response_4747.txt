Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 19) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 5) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 13) (8, 19) (9, 11) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 6) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 13) (15, 0) (4, 13) (4, 6) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 6) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 15, 13, 4> with edges (0, 15), (15, 13), (13, 4), (4, 0)
- Cycle 2: <0, 19, 17, 16> with edges (0, 19), (19, 17), (17, 16), (16, 0)
- Cycle 3: <1, 2, 6, 4> with edges (1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 4), (4, 1)
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 18, 5> with edges (1, 2), (2, 18), (18, 5), (5, 1)
- Cycle 5: <2, 6, 13, 12> with edges (2, 6), (6, 13), (13, 12), (12, 2)
- Cycle 6: <3, 14, 7, 10> with edges (3, 14), (14, 7), (7, 10), (10, 3)
- Cycle 7: <3, 12, 13, 4> with edges (3, 12), (12, 13), (13, 4), (4, 3)
- Cycle 8: <4, 13, 6, 2> with edges (4, 13), (13, 6), (6, 2), (2, 4)
- Cycle 9: <5, 18, 2, 1> with edges (5, 18), (18, 2), (2, 1), (1, 5)
- Cycle 10: <5, 11, 7, 14> with edges (5, 11), (11, 7), (7, 14), (14, 5)
- Cycle 11: <6, 16, 17, 19> with edges (6, 16), (16, 17), (17, 19), (19, 6)

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - <0, 15, 13, 4> has no chords
    - <0, 19, 17, 16> has no chords
    - <1, 2, 6, 4> has no chords
    - <1, 2, 18, 5> has no chords
    - <2, 6, 13, 12> has no chords
    - <3, 14, 7, 10> has no chords
    - <3, 12, 13, 4> has no chords
    - <4, 13, 6, 2> has no chords
    - <5, 18, 2, 1> has no chords
    - <5, 11, 7, 14> has no chords
    - <6, 16, 17, 19> has no chords

Step 3:
Since all cycles are chordless, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph. Therefore, the final count is [0].
