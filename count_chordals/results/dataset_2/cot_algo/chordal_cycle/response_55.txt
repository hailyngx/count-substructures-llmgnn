Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 14) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 11, 14, 8, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 2, 5, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 13, 5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 7, 10, 2, 3, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 8, 7, 12, 4, 12, 14, 8, 1)
- Cycle 6: (3, 0, 5, 1, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 0, 5, 2, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 11, 2, 5, 0, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Only Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (8, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Since only Cycle 5 has exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <8, 14, 12, 7>
