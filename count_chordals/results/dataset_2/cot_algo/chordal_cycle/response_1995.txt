Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 2) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 8, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 8, 3, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 4, 8, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 9, 7, 11, 10, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 9, 7, 5, 0, 10, 1)
- Cycle 6: (2, 13, 3, 8, 11, 7, 9, 14, 2)
- Cycle 7: (3, 4, 8, 11, 6, 0, 12, 7)
- Cycle 8: (3, 8, 11, 6, 13, 2, 14, 9)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 5, 7, 12, 13, 6, 11)
- Cycle 10: (5, 0, 6, 11, 7, 9, 14, 10)
- Cycle 11: (5, 4, 3, 13, 6, 0, 10, 5)
- Cycle 12: (7, 11, 8, 1, 9, 14, 2, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 3, (8), 1> - Chord: (3, 8)
- <1, 8, (3), 4, 1> - Chord: (8, 4)
- <1, 3, 4, (8), 1> - Chord: (3, 8)
- <1, 9, (7), 11, 10, 1> - Chord: (9, 7)
- <1, 9, 7, (5), 0, 10, 1> - Chord: (7, 5)
- <2, 13, 3, 8, (11), 7, 9, 14, 2> - Chord: (8, 11)
- <3, 4, 8, (11), 6, 0, 12, 7> - Chord: (8, 11)
- <3, 8, 10, (11), 6, 14, 9, 2, 13> - Chord: (8, 11)
- <4, 8, 5, (7), 12, 13, 6, 11> - Chord: (5, 7)
- <5, 0, 6, (11), 7, 9, 14, 10> - Chord: (6, 11)
- <5, 4, 3, 13, (6), 0, 10, 5> - Chord: (4, 6)
- <7, 11, 8, 1, 9, 14, 2, (13)> - Chord: (2, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
