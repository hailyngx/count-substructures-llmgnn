Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 26) (11, 2) (16, 11) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 25) (21, 22) (5, 11) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 10) (18, 21) (18, 12) (22, 21) (22, 17) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 4) (25, 21) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 24) (13, 26) (13, 12) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 28) (27, 12) (27, 14) (27, 3) (27, 23) (0, 11) (0, 20) (0, 3) (15, 9) (6, 25) (6, 7) (28, 25) (28, 12) (26, 11) (26, 13) (26, 10) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 24) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 7) (23, 21) (23, 27) (2, 11) (2, 19) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 4) (10, 14) (3, 27) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 4) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 3) (17, 4) (14, 1) (14, 27) (14, 10) (14, 3) (7, 6) (7, 19) (24, 25) (24, 29) (4, 20) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 17) 

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is:

<11, 5, 9, 15> 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
