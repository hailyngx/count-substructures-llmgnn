Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 18) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 4) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 19) (17, 11) (15, 5) (19, 3) (19, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 13) (18, 3) (18, 14) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, some of which are:
- Cycle <6, 9, 10, 8>
- Cycle <6, 9, 16, 8>
- Cycle <6, 11, 3, 12>
- Cycle <6, 11, 7, 14>
- Cycle <6, 14, 7, 11>
- Cycle <9, 10, 8, 16>
- Cycle <9, 10, 0, 8>
- Cycle <8, 13, 5, 2>
- Cycle <8, 13, 12, 3>
- Cycle <11, 3, 12, 1>
- and more...

Step 2:
After examining the cycles, we can identify the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, 9, 10, 8> with chord (9, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, 11, 3, 12> with chord (11, 3)
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, 11, 7, 14> with chord (11, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, 14, 7, 11> with chord (14, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <9, 10, 8, 16> with chord (10, 16)
- and more...

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0], as all identified cycles have exactly one chord.

So, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5], and the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <6, 9, 10, 8> with chord (9, 10)
- <6, 11, 3, 12> with chord (11, 3)
- <6, 11, 7, 14> with chord (11, 14)
- <6, 14, 7, 11> with chord (14, 7)
- <9, 10, 8, 16> with chord (10, 16)
