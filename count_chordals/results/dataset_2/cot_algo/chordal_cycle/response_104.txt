Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 10) (27, 3) (27, 5) (7, 21) (7, 22) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 22) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 14) (22, 7) (22, 21) (22, 18) (22, 0) (0, 22) (0, 24) (20, 29) (20, 5) (20, 11) (28, 21) (28, 4) (1, 16) (1, 13) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 11) (29, 20) (29, 6) (29, 26) (29, 25) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 4) (4, 28) (4, 13) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 3) (23, 26) (23, 24) (26, 29) (26, 23) (8, 15) (8, 16) (9, 2) (9, 11) (6, 17) (6, 29) (6, 25) (6, 3) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 24) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 16) (24, 2) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 11) (19, 2) (3, 27) (3, 12) (3, 6) (14, 18) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 24) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 25) (5, 27) (5, 20) (5, 12) (25, 29) (25, 6) (25, 2) (25, 10) (10, 27) (10, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <15, 27, 5, 12> (cycle of length 4)
- <15, 27, 3, 12> (cycle of length 4)
- <15, 27, 10, 5> (cycle of length 4)
- <7, 21, 22, 18> (cycle of length 4)
- <0, 22, 18, 14> (cycle of length 4)
- <20, 29, 6, 17> (cycle of length 4)
- <13, 17, 11, 20> (cycle of length 4)
- <1, 16, 8, 15> (cycle of length 4)
- <29, 25, 2, 24> (cycle of length 4)
- <27, 10, 25, 29> (cycle of length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <15, 27, 5, 12> has a chord (15, 5) 
- <15, 27, 3, 12> has a chord (15, 3)
- <15, 27, 10, 5> has a chord (15, 10)
- <7, 21, 22, 18> has a chord (7, 22)
- <0, 22, 18, 14> has a chord (0, 18)
- <20, 29, 6, 17> has a chord (20, 6)
- <13, 17, 11, 20> has a chord (13, 11)
- <1, 16, 8, 15> has a chord (1, 8)
- <29, 25, 2, 24> has a chord (29, 2)
- <27, 10, 25, 29> has a chord (27, 25)

Step 3: From the list above, the number of chordal 4-cycles found is [10].
