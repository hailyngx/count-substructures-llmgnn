Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 26) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 21) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 18) (0, 5) (27, 0) (27, 18) (9, 1) (9, 24) (9, 23) (1, 9) (1, 21) (1, 16) (1, 19) (21, 15) (21, 1) (21, 14) (28, 13) (28, 23) (29, 0) (29, 13) (29, 10) (24, 15) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 3) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 17) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 1) (19, 5) (11, 26) (23, 9) (23, 28) (23, 7) (4, 12) (4, 25) (4, 20) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 22) (22, 3) (22, 12) (10, 29) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 16) (2, 12) (14, 3) (14, 21) (14, 25) (8, 25) (8, 16) (7, 23) (7, 20) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 7) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 13) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 25) (13, 28) (13, 29) (13, 16) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 12) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 8) (25, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 21, 14, 3)
- Cycle 2: (0, 27, 18, 10, 29, 0)
- Cycle 3: (9, 1, 21, 15, 24, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 24, 26, 11, 10, 18, 12, 17, 24)
- Cycle 5: (1, 9, 24, 17, 12, 22, 3, 15, 21, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 9, 23, 7, 20, 4, 12, 17, 24, 15, 21, 1)
- Cycle 7: (4, 12, 17, 24, 26, 3, 15, 21, 14, 25, 4)
- Cycle 8: (12, 17, 24, 26, 11, 10, 18, 25, 14, 21, 15, 24)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3: (9, 1, 21, 15, 24, 9) has a chord (1, 24)
- Cycle 5: (1, 9, 24, 17, 12, 22, 3, 15, 21, 1) has a chord (9, 3)
- Cycle 8: (12, 17, 24, 26, 11, 10, 18, 25, 14, 21, 15, 24) has a chord (17, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<3, 15, 21, 14>
<0, 27, 18, 10, 29>
<9, 1, 21, 15>
<9, 24, 17, 12, 22, 3>
<12, 17, 24, 26>
