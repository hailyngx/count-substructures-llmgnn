Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 18) (16, 10) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 7) (6, 7) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 15) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 2) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 4) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 13) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 0) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

In this graph, let's identify the cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 2-5-9-10-2
- Cycle 2: 2-5-9-10-4-2
- Cycle 3: 2-5-9-10-16-18-2
- Cycle 4: 2-14-17-12-6-7-4-2
- Cycle 5: 2-14-17-12-3-7-4-2
- Cycle 6: 2-14-17-7-3-12-6-4-2
- Cycle 7: 0-4-10-9-5-2-18-16-15-8-0
- Cycle 8: 0-4-10-9-5-2-14-17-7-6-12-3-0
- Cycle 9: 0-8-13-15-16-18-2-14-4-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

In the identified cycles, we see that Cycle 1 has exactly one chord:
1. <1, (9, 10)> where the chord is the edge (9, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As Cycle 1 is the only chordal 4-cycle in the graph, the final count is [1].
