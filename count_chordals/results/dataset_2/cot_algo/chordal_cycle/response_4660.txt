Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 9, 3, 7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (1, 7, 0, 3, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 1, 3, 0, 2)
- Cycle 5: (8, 1, 3, 4, 8)
- Cycle 6: (6, 4, 9, 2, 6)
- Cycle 7: (0, 3, 9, 4, 0)
- Cycle 8: (5, 1, 7, 0, 5)
- Cycle 9: (2, 8, 6, 4, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Checking Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 1, 5) doesn't have a chord.
- Checking Cycle 2: (4, 9, 3, 7, 4) has a chord (4, 7).
- Checking Cycle 3: (1, 7, 0, 3, 1) doesn't have a chord.
- Checking Cycle 4: (2, 1, 3, 0, 2) doesn't have a chord.
- Checking Cycle 5: (8, 1, 3, 4, 8) doesn't have a chord.
- Checking Cycle 6: (6, 4, 9, 2, 6) doesn't have a chord.
- Checking Cycle 7: (0, 3, 9, 4, 0) doesn't have a chord.
- Checking Cycle 8: (5, 1, 7, 0, 5) doesn't have a chord.
- Checking Cycle 9: (2, 8, 6, 4, 2) doesn't have a chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are <1, 3, 8, 9> chordal 4-cycles in this graph, providing a count of [4].
