Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- Cycle 1: 1-9-6-0-1 
- Cycle 2: 2-3-1-6-2 
- Cycle 3: 4-6-9-7-4

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: 1-9-6-0-1 <(6,0)>
- Cycle 2: 2-3-1-6-2 <(3,6)>
- Cycle 3: 4-6-9-7-4 <(9,7)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 9, 6, 0, 1> with a chord (6, 0)
<2, 3, 1, 6, 2> with a chord (3, 6)
<4, 6, 9, 7, 4> with a chord (9, 7)
