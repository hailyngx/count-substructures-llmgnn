Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 6) (13, 0) (13, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 10) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 11 - 14 - 4
- Cycle 2: 0 - 1 - 12 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 3: 0 - 1 - 12 - 9 - 3
- Cycle 4: 0 - 1 - 12 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 5: 0 - 1 - 3 - 9 - 7
- Cycle 6: 0 - 1 - 3 - 9 - 8
- Cycle 7: 0 - 12 - 1 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 8: 0 - 12 - 1 - 11 - 14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (0, 14)
    <0, 1, 4, 14>
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (1, 9)
    <0, 1, 3, 9>
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord: (1, 14)
    <0, 1, 11, 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
