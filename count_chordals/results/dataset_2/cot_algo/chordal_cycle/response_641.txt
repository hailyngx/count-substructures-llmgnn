Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 10) (9, 1) (26, 16) (6, 14) (6, 29) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 13) (11, 25) (8, 15) (8, 7) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 28) (4, 23) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 14) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 28) (18, 13) (21, 28) (21, 5) (28, 23) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 24) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 14) (17, 29) (17, 19) (17, 22) (17, 27) (29, 6) (29, 17) (29, 25) (5, 18) (5, 21) (19, 17) (19, 1) (15, 8) (25, 11) (25, 29) (25, 22) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 25) (22, 24) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 16) (0, 23) (0, 2) (0, 18) (24, 28) (24, 22) (24, 1) (24, 20) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (20, 24) (20, 16) (27, 11) (27, 17) (1, 9) (1, 19) (1, 24) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 3) (16, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (9, 10, 11, 13, 7, 8, 15, 8, 7, 3, 6, 14, 4, 23, 0, 2, 18, 28, 24, 1, 9)
- Cycle 2: (26, 16, 4, 14, 12, 7, 3, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 has a unique chord (9, 1) connecting non-adjacent nodes 9 and 1.
- Cycle 2 does not have any chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There is 1 chordless cycle found, so the final answer is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <(9, 1), 9, 10, 11, 13>.
