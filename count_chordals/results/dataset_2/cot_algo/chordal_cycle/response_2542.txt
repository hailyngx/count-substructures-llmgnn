Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 10) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (4, 8, 2, 0, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 5, 0, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 3, 0, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 14, 13, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 8, 3, 7, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 1, 7, 3, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 9, 7, 3, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 10, 7, 3, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 10, 12, 0, 4)
- Cycle 10: (8, 5, 10, 12, 8)
- Cycle 11: (8, 14, 13, 12, 8)
- Cycle 12: (5, 10, 12, 0, 5)
- Cycle 13: (6, 4, 8, 5, 6)
- Cycle 14: (6, 3, 7, 9, 6)
- Cycle 15: (2, 8, 3, 0, 2)
- Cycle 16: (2, 8, 14, 13, 2)
- Cycle 17: (2, 0, 12, 13, 2)
- Cycle 18: (3, 6, 7, 9, 3)
- Cycle 19: (3, 14, 13, 12, 3)
- Cycle 20: (7, 3, 8, 14, 7)
- Cycle 21: (7, 3, 0, 2, 7)
- Cycle 22: (7, 10, 12, 0, 7)
- Cycle 23: (7, 1, 4, 9, 7)
- Cycle 24: (0, 5, 8, 3, 0)
- Cycle 25: (0, 5, 10, 12, 0)
- Cycle 26: (0, 2, 13, 14, 0)
- Cycle 27: (0, 3, 7, 9, 0)
- Cycle 28: (0, 3, 8, 2, 0)
- Cycle 29: (0, 11, 9, 7, 0)
- Cycle 30: (0, 12, 13, 14, 0)
- Cycle 31: (1, 4, 8, 2, 1)
- Cycle 32: (1, 7, 3, 6, 1)
- Cycle 33: (1, 9, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 34: (9, 4, 8, 14, 9)
- Cycle 35: (9, 11, 0, 12, 9)
- Cycle 36: (9, 7, 3, 8, 9)
- Cycle 37: (9, 10, 12, 0, 9)
- Cycle 38: (13, 2, 8, 5, 13)
- Cycle 39: (13, 12, 10, 9, 13)
- Cycle 40: (13, 14, 8, 4, 13)
- Cycle 41: (10, 4, 1, 7, 10)
- Cycle 42: (10, 5, 0, 11, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (0, 2), 8, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, (3, 7), 9, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <10, (5, 0), 12, 9)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- There are 42 cycles with exactly one chord, so the number of chordal 4-cycles is [3].
