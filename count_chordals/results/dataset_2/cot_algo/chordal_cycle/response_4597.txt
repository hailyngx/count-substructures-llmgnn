Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 3 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 2: 4 - 5 - 1 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 6 - 8 - 2 - 4
- Cycle 4: 8 - 6 - 4 - 1 - 8
- Cycle 5: 9 - 4 - 6 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 3 - 7 - 5 - 9
- Cycle 7: 2 - 8 - 9 - 0 - 2
- Cycle 8: 7 - 3 - 0 - 9 - 7
- Cycle 9: 0 - 1 - 5 - 3 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (7, 9)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 3 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 5 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (3, 5)
- Cycle 7 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 8 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 9 does not have exactly one chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, (7, 9), 3, 9>
- <4, (5, 7), 1, 7>
- <6, (3, 5), 9, 0>
