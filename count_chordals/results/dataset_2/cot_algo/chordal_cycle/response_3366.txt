Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-5-8-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-5-6-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-1-5-6-3-0
- Cycle 5: 2-6-3-4-2
- Cycle 6: 4-3-6-2-4
- Cycle 7: 5-1-4-3-5
- Cycle 8: 5-6-3-4-5
- Cycle 9: 5-1-0-9-5
- Cycle 10: 7-0-1-5-7
- Cycle 11: 7-0-8-5-7
- Cycle 12: 7-0-9-5-7

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 2: 0-1-5-8-0 with chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 8: 5-6-3-4-5 with chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 9: 5-1-0-9-5 with chord (0, 9)
- Cycle 10: 7-0-1-5-7 with chord (1, 5)

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles is therefore [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<0, 1, 5, 8> 
<3, 4, 5, 6>
<0, 1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 7, 0>
