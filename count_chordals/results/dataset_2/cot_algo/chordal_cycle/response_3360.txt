Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 14) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 29) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 5) (0, 3) (0, 27) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 7) (7, 27) (7, 23) (7, 17) (20, 25) (20, 29) (25, 20) (25, 10) (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 18) (10, 25) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 29) (12, 27) (12, 11) (12, 16) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (22, 19) (22, 28) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 5) (29, 26) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 11) (29, 14) (18, 9) (18, 1) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 4) (23, 7) (23, 1) (23, 6) (24, 0) (24, 17) (17, 7) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 28) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 17) (28, 14) (13, 2) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 23) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 16) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 29) (14, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (9, 26, 1, 18, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 26, 29, 15, 3, 0, 11, 29, 14, 9)
- Cycle 3: (3, 15, 5, 19, 2, 6, 23, 7, 27, 0, 3)
- Cycle 4: (20, 25, 10, 8, 2, 19, 22, 28, 17, 7, 23, 6, 3, 15, 29, 20)
- Cycle 5: (25, 10, 19, 5, 14, 28, 1, 26, 29, 15, 5)
- Cycle 6: (26, 29, 20, 25, 10, 19, 5, 15, 29)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (26, 9), 18, 1>: Chords: (26, 9)
- <9, (26, 1), 18, 9>: Chords: (26, 1)
- <3, (15, 29), 5, 19, 2, 6, 23, 7, 27, 0, 3>: Chords: (15, 29)
- <20, (25, 10), 8, 2, 19, 22, 28, 17, 7, 23, 6, 3, 15, 29, 20>: Chords: (25, 10)
- <25, (10, 19), 5, 14, 28, 1, 26, 29, 15, 5>: Chords: (10, 19)
- <26, (29, 20), 25, 10, 19, 5, 15, 29>: Chords: (29, 20)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (26, 9), 18, 1>
- <9, (26, 1), 18, 9>
- <3, (15, 29), 5, 19, 2, 6, 23, 7, 27, 0, 3>
- <20, (25, 10), 8, 2, 19, 22, 28, 17, 7, 23, 6, 3, 15, 29, 20>
- <25, (10, 19), 5, 14, 28, 1, 26, 29, 15, 5>
- <26, (29, 20), 25, 10, 19, 5, 15, 29>
