Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 25) (1, 2) (25, 1) (25, 28) (25, 22) (25, 2) (10, 19) (10, 16) (11, 24) (11, 22) (11, 26) (0, 24) (0, 23) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 16) (3, 27) (3, 29) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 24) (26, 11) (26, 14) (26, 5) (5, 26) (5, 22) (5, 27) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 25) (2, 17) (12, 19) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 21) (21, 16) (21, 27) (8, 24) (8, 18) (28, 25) (28, 17) (28, 22) (28, 18) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 14) (24, 8) (24, 23) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 27) (15, 9) (15, 23) (15, 6) (15, 4) (23, 0) (23, 24) (23, 15) (23, 4) (6, 20) (6, 15) (6, 29) (29, 3) (29, 6) (29, 13) (29, 22) (19, 10) (19, 12) (27, 3) (27, 5) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 17) (13, 9) (13, 29) (7, 14) (7, 5) (22, 25) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 28) (22, 29) (17, 2) (17, 28) (17, 27) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 23) (18, 8) (18, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (1, 25, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 25, 22, 11, 24, 0, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 25, 22, 29, 6, 20, 16, 10, 19, 12, 16, 21, 27, 3, 29, 6, 15, 4, 20, 16, 21, 27, 5, 26, 14, 24, 11, 26, 14, 7, 5, 22, 25, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 25, 2, 17)
- Cycle 5: (1, 25, 28, 22, 11, 26, 5, 27, 21, 16, 20, 6, 29, 3, 27, 5, 14, 26, 11, 24, 8, 18, 28, 17, 2, 25, 22, 5, 7, 14, 24, 23, 0, 24, 8, 18, 28, 17, 2, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 25, 28, 17)
- Cycle 7: (1, 25, 22, 29)
- Cycle 8: (1, 25, 2)
- Cycle 9: (1, 25, 28, 18)
- Cycle 10: (1, 25, 22, 11)
- Cycle 11: (1, 25, 22, 5)
- Cycle 12: (1, 25, 28)
- Cycle 13: (1, 25, 22)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (11, 24)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (27, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, we found 11 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [11]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 25, 2, 1> with the chord (2, 17).
