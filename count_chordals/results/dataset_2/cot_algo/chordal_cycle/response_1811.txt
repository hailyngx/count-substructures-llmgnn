Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-2-6-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-6-3-4-5
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 2)
        - Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 4)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        Since none of the cycles are chordless, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
