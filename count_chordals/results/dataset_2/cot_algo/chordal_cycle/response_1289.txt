Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 7) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 14) (12, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph
- Cycle 1: (10, 8, 4, 2, 10)
- Cycle 2: (10, 8, 1, 5, 10)
- Cycle 3: (10, 5, 13, 6, 10)
- Cycle 4: (10, 14, 6, 0, 10)
- Cycle 5: (11, 5, 1, 8, 11)
- Cycle 6: (11, 7, 6, 1, 11)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 1, 5, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 9, 2, 3, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 2, 14, 10, 4)
- Cycle 10: (8, 2, 4, 9, 8)
- Cycle 11: (8, 1, 5, 10, 8)
- Cycle 12: (2, 4, 14, 6, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 9, 7, 3, 2)
- Cycle 14: (0, 8, 1, 6, 0)
- Cycle 15: (14, 2, 9, 12, 14)
- Cycle 16: (14, 10, 5, 1, 14)
- Cycle 17: (5, 1, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 18: (5, 13, 3, 2, 5)
- Cycle 19: (13, 6, 7, 9, 13)
- Cycle 20: (1, 8, 2, 4, 1)
- Cycle 21: (6, 0, 3, 7, 6)
- Cycle 22: (3, 4, 9, 12, 3)
- Cycle 23: (7, 11, 5, 1, 7)
- Cycle 24: (9, 4, 14, 12, 9)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle
- Only Cycle 9: (4, 9, 2, 3, 4) has exactly one chord which is (9, 3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (9, 3), 4>
