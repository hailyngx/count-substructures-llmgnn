Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 9, 7, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 4, 7, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 8, 2, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (9, 7, 4, 9)
        - Cycle 6: (9, 2, 8, 9)
        - Cycle 7: (4, 7, 3, 4)
        - Cycle 8: (7, 5, 1, 7)
        - Cycle 9: (2, 5, 1, 2)
        - Cycle 10: (8, 5, 1, 8)
        - Cycle 11: (6, 4, 7, 6)
        - Cycle 12: (3, 7, 4, 3)
        - Cycle 13: (3, 2, 8, 3)
        - Cycle 14: (3, 6, 8, 3)
        - Cycle 15: (0, 9, 7, 0)
        - Cycle 16: (0, 1, 5, 0)
        - Cycle 17: (0, 3, 4, 0)
        - Cycle 18: (5, 4, 3, 6, 8, 2, 9, 7, 5) - This cycle is of length 9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        
        - The only cycle with exactly one chord is: <1, (3, 6), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        
        There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, so the final count is [1].
