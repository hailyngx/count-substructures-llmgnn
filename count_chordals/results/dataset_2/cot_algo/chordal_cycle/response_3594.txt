Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 1) (0, 19) (3, 12) (11, 7) (5, 12) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 15) (4, 17) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 16) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 17) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 0) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 14) (16, 1) (16, 6) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 14) (18, 15) (18, 10) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (2, 8, 17, 6, 1, 0, 2)
- Cycle 2: (2, 8, 17, 12, 3, 12, 5, 12, 15, 0, 2)
- Cycle 3: (2, 8, 17, 12, 15, 4, 13, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 9, 7, 11, 7, 19, 0, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 13, 4, 15, 0, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 13, 14, 9, 7, 19, 0, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 13, 14, 10, 18, 15, 4, 13)
- Cycle 8: (2, 13, 4, 15, 18, 10, 14, 9, 7, 19, 0, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 13, 14, 10, 19, 0, 2)
- Cycle 10: (8, 17, 4, 13, 14, 9, 7, 11, 7, 19, 0, 2)
- Cycle 11: (8, 17, 4, 15, 18, 10, 14, 13, 2)
- Cycle 12: (8, 17, 4, 15, 0, 2)
- Cycle 13: (8, 17, 6, 16, 1, 0, 2)
- Cycle 14: (8, 17, 12, 15, 0, 2)
- Cycle 15: (8, 17, 12, 5, 12, 15, 0, 2)
- Cycle 16: (0, 2, 13, 14, 9, 7, 11, 7, 19, 0)
- Cycle 17: (0, 15, 4, 13, 2)
- Cycle 18: (0, 15, 4, 14, 10, 19, 0)
- Cycle 19: (0, 15, 12, 17, 4, 13, 2)
- Cycle 20: (0, 15, 12, 17, 6, 1, 0)
- Cycle 21: (0, 1, 6, 16, 1)
- Cycle 22: (12, 3, 12, 15, 0, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
In this case, cycles 2, 8, 10, 11, and 20 have exactly one chord each.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 22 cycles found, and 5 of them have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [17].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <2, 8, 17, 6>
- <2, 13, 4, 15>
- <2, 9, 7, 11>
- <8, 17, 4, 15>
- <0, 15, 12, 17>
