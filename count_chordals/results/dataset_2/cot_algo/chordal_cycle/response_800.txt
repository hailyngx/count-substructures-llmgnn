Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 2) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 1, 0, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 9, 2, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 3: (10, 5, 9, 2, 10)
        - Cycle 4: (0, 9, 2, 1, 0)
        - Cycle 5: (2, 9, 0, 13, 2)
        - Cycle 6: (7, 4, 12, 1, 7)
        - Cycle 7: (13, 1, 12, 2, 13)
        - Cycle 8: (6, 3, 2, 9, 6)
        - Cycle 9: (14, 8, 7, 2, 14)
        - Cycle 10: (12, 4, 11, 13, 12)
        - Cycle 11: (10, 7, 2, 3, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

        - The chordal 4-cycle is <2, (9, 7), 4, 12)> with non-adjacent chords 9 and 7.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 10 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
