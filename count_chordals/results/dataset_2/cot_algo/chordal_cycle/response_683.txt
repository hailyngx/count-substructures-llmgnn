Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 7) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 2) (7, 17) (7, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 5) (9, 11) (10, 5) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 18) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 5) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (0, 3, 4, 5, 16, 19, 8, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 3, 4, 5, 18, 6, 13, 19, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 8, 0, 3, 14, 2, 7, 17, 13, 6, 18, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 19, 13, 18, 6, 12, 17, 7, 2, 14, 0, 8)
- Cycle 5: (5, 18, 6, 12, 17, 13, 19, 16, 5)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<Cycle 4, (2, 14)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 4 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
