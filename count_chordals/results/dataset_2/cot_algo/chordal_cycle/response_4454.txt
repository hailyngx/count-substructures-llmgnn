Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 2 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 5 - 7 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 6 - 4 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 4: 1 - 2 - 4 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 5: 3 - 8 - 9 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 6: 4 - 6 - 8 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 7: 5 - 7 - 9 - 8 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (2, 4).
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (9, 7).
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (6, 8).
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (9, 7).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 5, 7, 9> (chord: (9, 7))
- <0, 6, 8, 9> (chord: (6, 8))
- <1, 2, 4, 8> (chord: (2, 4))
- <3, 7, 9, 8> (chord: (9, 7))
