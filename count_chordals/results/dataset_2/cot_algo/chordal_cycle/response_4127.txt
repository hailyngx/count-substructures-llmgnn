Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 1) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 8) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 12) (13, 3) (19, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (17, 16) (17, 0) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 8) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 1) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 12) (7, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-11-3-15-5-0-10-7-1
- Cycle 2: 2-9-6-4-2
- Cycle 3: 8-11-1-16-12-8
- Cycle 4: 12-16-17-0-5-12
- Cycle 5: 14-9-6-18-14

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, let's check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3: 8-11-1-16-12-8 has the chord (1, 16)
- Cycle 5: 14-9-6-18-14 has the chord (9, 6)

Step 3:
As we found 2 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, the total count is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <8, (1, 16), 12, 11>
2. <14, (9, 6), 18, 4>
