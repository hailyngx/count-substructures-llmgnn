Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 11) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 26) (15, 13) (15, 3) (15, 11) (8, 24) (8, 10) (8, 17) (23, 11) (23, 21) (23, 12) (0, 3) (0, 20) (0, 11) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 6) (7, 12) (7, 26) (7, 5) (12, 23) (12, 7) (12, 16) (6, 20) (6, 28) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 10) (19, 1) (19, 16) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 24) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 10) (24, 29) (4, 27) (4, 2) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 1) (16, 12) (16, 19) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 29) (9, 25) (29, 24) (29, 9) (29, 10) (11, 22) (11, 15) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 1) (2, 13) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 14) (18, 28) (18, 27) (18, 21) (25, 9) (25, 10) (14, 20) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 21) (1, 19) (1, 27) (1, 11) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 14) (21, 17) (17, 8) (17, 21) (10, 8) (10, 28) (10, 24) (10, 29) (10, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- <0, 11, 22, 2> cycle
- <0, 20, 6, 28> cycle
- <1, 11, 22, 2> cycle
- <1, 19, 16, 12> cycle
- <1, 27, 4, 2> cycle
- <2, 14, 21, 17> cycle
- <3, 15, 11, 23> cycle
- <3, 26, 7, 12> cycle
- <4, 27, 1, 19> cycle
- <5, 14, 21, 17> cycle
- <5, 7, 12, 16> cycle
- <6, 20, 0, 3> cycle
- <8, 10, 28, 6> cycle
- <8, 17, 21, 14> cycle
- <8, 24, 26, 7> cycle
- <8, 24, 29, 9> cycle
- <9, 25, 10, 8> cycle
- <10, 24, 26, 3> cycle
- <11, 1, 19, 16> cycle
- <11, 2, 14, 21> cycle
- <11, 15, 3, 0> cycle
- <12, 16, 19, 1> cycle
- <12, 23, 11, 1> cycle
- <14, 2, 27, 1> cycle
- <14, 5, 7, 12> cycle
- <15, 3, 0, 20> cycle
- <18, 21, 14, 5> cycle
- <18, 27, 4, 2> cycle
- <18, 28, 6, 20> cycle
- <21, 14, 5, 7> cycle
- <21, 17, 8, 10> cycle
- <22, 2, 14, 21> cycle
- <23, 11, 1, 19> cycle
- <24, 8, 17, 21> cycle
- <24, 10, 25, 9> cycle
- <26, 3, 0, 20> cycle
- <27, 4, 2, 22> cycle
- <28, 6, 20, 0> cycle
- <29, 9, 25, 10> cycle

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The cycle <0, 11, 22, 2> has chord (11, 2)
- The cycle <2, 14, 21, 17> has chord (14, 17)
- The cycle <3, 26, 7, 12> has chord (26, 12)
- The cycle <4, 27, 1, 19> has chord (27, 19)
- The cycle <5, 14, 21, 17> has chord (14, 17)
- The cycle <8, 17, 21, 14> has chord (17, 14)
- The cycle <9, 25, 10, 8> has chord (25, 10)
- The cycle <10, 24, 26, 3> has chord (24, 26)
- The cycle <11, 15, 3, 0> has chord (15, 0)
- The cycle <12, 16, 19, 1> has chord (16, 1)
- The cycle <14, 5, 7, 12> has chord (5, 12)
- The cycle <22, 2, 14, 21> has chord (2, 21)
- The cycle <23, 11, 1, 19> has chord (11, 19)
- The cycle <24, 10, 25, 9> has chord (10, 25)
- The cycle <26, 3, 0, 20> has chord (3, 20)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are a total of 15 chordal 4-cycles.

Therefore, the final count is [15].
