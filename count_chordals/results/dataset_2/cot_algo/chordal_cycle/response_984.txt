Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: {1, 4, 8, 3}
- Cycle 2: {2, 7, 12, 3}
- Cycle 3: {2, 7, 12, 9}
- Cycle 4: {2, 4, 13, 6}
- Cycle 5: {2, 14, 10, 12}
- Cycle 6: {3, 8, 4, 13}
- Cycle 7: {5, 8, 2, 7}
- Cycle 8: {6, 13, 3, 9}
- Cycle 9: {7, 2, 0, 1}
- Cycle 10: {7, 2, 8, 5}
- Cycle 11: {10, 12, 3, 9}
- Cycle 12: {11, 2, 7, 12}
- Cycle 13: {11, 1, 4, 8}
- Cycle 14: {12, 14, 9, 6}
- Cycle 15: {12, 14, 8, 5}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 4, (8, 3)>
- <2, 7, (12, 3)>
- <2, 7, (12, 9)>
- <2, 4, (13, 6)>
- <2, 14, (10, 12)>
- <3, 8, (4, 13)>
- <5, 8, (2, 7)>
- <6, 13, (3, 9)>
- <7, 2, (0, 1)>
- <7, 2, (8, 5)>
- <10, 12, (3, 9)>
- <11, 2, (7, 12)>
- <11, 1, (4, 8)>
- <12, 14, (9, 6)>
- <12, 14, (8, 5)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
