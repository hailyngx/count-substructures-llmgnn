Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 1) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 5) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 0) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 3) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 16) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 3) (13, 1) (16, 10) (16, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 10, 15, 19, 7)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 19, 14, 6, 1, 8, 2, 12, 3, 6, 11, 2, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 19, 14, 6, 3, 12, 2, 11, 6, 1, 8, 2, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (2,11).
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (3,6).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. < (4, 7, 19, 14, 6, 3, 12, 2), (3, 6), 11)>
2. < (4, 7, 19, 14, 6, 1, 8, 2), (2, 11), 4)>
