Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 27) (22, 11) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 21) (1, 5) (21, 13) (21, 1) (21, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (3, 20) (25, 18) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 29) (11, 22) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 0) (15, 17) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 9) (2, 21) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 17) (8, 20) (8, 2) (8, 7) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 16) (19, 27) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 23) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (28, 16) (28, 18) (28, 23) (16, 19) (16, 28) (16, 27) (18, 25) (18, 26) (18, 28) (4, 10) (4, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (23, 26) (23, 28) (5, 1) (24, 10) (24, 0) (24, 9) (9, 11) (9, 20) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 24) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 24) (27, 22) (27, 19) (27, 16) (29, 10) 

Response:
[4]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <13, 22, 1, 21>

Explanation:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (13, 22, 1, 21)
- Cycle 2: (14, 17, 15, 7)
- Cycle 3: (10, 11, 9, 4)
- Cycle 4: (10, 11, 14, 6)
- Cycle 5: (10, 24, 0, 12)
- Cycle 6: (19, 22, 27, 16)
- Cycle 7: (19, 26, 18, 28)
- Cycle 8: (7, 14, 6, 12)
- Cycle 9: (7, 10, 24, 9)
- Cycle 10: (16, 19, 27, 22)

Step 2:
- Checking for exactly one chord: Only Cycle 1 <13, 22, 1, 21> has exactly one chord, which is the edge (22, 1).

Step 3:
Since there is one unique chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
