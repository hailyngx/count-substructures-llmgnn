Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 4) (15, 18) (8, 23) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 25) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 9) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 19) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 6) (0, 23) (7, 11) (7, 27) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 9) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 24) (17, 28) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 27) (20, 13) (20, 17) (20, 22) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 29) (9, 23) (9, 16) (9, 29) (9, 21) (29, 11) (29, 9) (4, 3) (4, 23) (4, 16) (4, 10) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 19) (2, 16) (2, 22) (22, 20) (22, 2) (22, 14) (25, 8) (25, 17) (25, 14) (25, 10) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 1) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 25) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 27) (24, 28) (24, 21) (21, 9) (21, 24) (5, 12) (5, 27) (18, 15) (18, 6) (6, 26) (6, 18) (10, 4) (10, 25) (10, 1) (27, 7) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 3, 4, 23, 8)
- Cycle 2: (23, 8, 19, 13, 26)
- Cycle 3: (8, 25, 14, 26, 13)
- Cycle 4: (8, 23, 4, 16, 9)
- Cycle 5: (23, 11, 7, 27, 17)
- Cycle 6: (16, 28, 17, 27, 1)
- Cycle 7: (28, 24, 21, 9, 16)
- Cycle 8: (16, 4, 10, 25, 14)
- Cycle 9: (23, 0, 23, 4, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <1, (8, 19), 4>
- <2, (14, 26), 3>
- <3, (13, 19), 2>
- <4, (4, 16), 8>
- <5, (7, 27), 11>
- <6, (17, 27), 11>
- <7, (21, 9), 24>
- <8, (10, 25), 4>
- <9, (23, 4), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 9 chordless 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final answer is [9].
