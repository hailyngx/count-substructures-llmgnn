Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 0) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
1. (2, 6, 3, 11)
2. (2, 6, 8, 0)
3. (2, 11, 9, 4)
4. (2, 11, 1, 14)
5. (2, 13, 8, 6)
6. (2, 13, 5, 10)
7. (2, 0, 4, 9)
8. (4, 9, 3, 11)
9. (4, 9, 12, 13)
10. (4, 9, 11, 1)
11. (4, 0, 8, 13)
12. (4, 0, 6, 2)
13. (4, 0, 2, 1)
14. (4, 12, 13, 8)
15. (4, 12, 7, 10)
16. (4, 14, 1, 11)
17. (7, 10, 3, 11)
18. (7, 10, 5, 13)
19. (7, 12, 13, 8)
20. (7, 12, 4, 9)
21. (7, 5, 13, 8)
22. (7, 5, 10, 3)
23. (7, 8, 0, 4)
24. (7, 8, 14, 1)
25. (8, 13, 12, 4)
26. (8, 13, 5, 7)
27. (8, 13, 6, 2)
28. (8, 13, 2, 1)
29. (8, 14, 1, 11)
30. (13, 12, 4, 9)
31. (13, 12, 7, 10)
32. (13, 5, 7, 10)
33. (13, 5, 10, 3)
34. (13, 5, 2, 6)
35. (12, 7, 10, 3)
36. (12, 7, 5, 13)
37. (12, 9, 4, 0)
38. (12, 9, 11, 1)
39. (5, 7, 12, 13)
40. (5, 7, 8, 13)
41. (5, 10, 7, 12)
42. (5, 10, 3, 11)
43. (9, 4, 0, 8)
44. (9, 4, 14, 1)
45. (9, 3, 11, 1)
46. (9, 3, 10, 5)
47. (10, 7, 8, 13)
48. (10, 7, 5, 13)
49. (10, 3, 11, 1)
50. (0, 4, 12, 13)
51. (0, 4, 9, 11)
52. (0, 8, 13, 12)
53. (0, 8, 6, 2) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
1. <2, (13, 5), 10, 3>. Chord: (13, 5)
2. <4, (12, 7), 10, 3>. Chord: (12, 7)
3. <4, (9, 12), 7, 10>. Chord: (9, 12)
4. <7, (12, 13), 8, 4>. Chord: (12, 13)
5. <8, (13, 2), 6, 4>. Chord: (13, 2)
6. <13, (5, 10), 7, 8>. Chord: (5, 10)
7. <12, (9, 4), 0, 8>. Chord: (9, 4)
8. <0, (8, 6), 2, 4>. Chord: (8, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [8].
