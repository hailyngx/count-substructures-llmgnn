Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (10, 2) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-4-5-8-1
- Cycle 2: 2-1-4-5-2
- Cycle 3: 3-2-9-13-3
- Cycle 4: 6-9-2-12-6
- Cycle 5: 7-1-4-5-7
- Cycle 6: 8-4-5-11-8
- Cycle 7: 10-2-9-12-10
- Cycle 8: 11-5-13-3-11
- Cycle 9: 12-6-11-5-12
- Cycle 10: 13-9-12-7-13
- Cycle 11: 14-1-7-13-14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1: 1-4-5-8-1 has one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 2: 2-1-4-5-2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3: 3-2-9-13-3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4: 6-9-2-12-6 has no chord.
- Cycle 5: 7-1-4-5-7 has one chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 6: 8-4-5-11-8 has one chord: (5, 11)
- Cycle 7: 10-2-9-12-10 has no chord.
- Cycle 8: 11-5-13-3-11 has one chord: (5, 13)
- Cycle 9: 12-6-11-5-12 has one chord: (6, 11)
- Cycle 10: 13-9-12-7-13 has one chord: (9, 12)
- Cycle 11: 14-1-7-13-14 has one chord: (1, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 3 chordless cycles found: 
- Cycle 2: 2-1-4-5-2
- Cycle 3: 3-2-9-13-3
- Cycle 7: 10-2-9-12-10

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [3].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (4, 8)> for cycle 1
<5, (5, 11)> for cycle 6
<6, 11> for cycle 9
<9, 12> for cycle 10
<14, (1, 7)> for cycle 11
