Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
  - Cycle 1: 5-9-3-5
  - Cycle 2: 5-4-6-5
  - Cycle 3: 5-7-6-5
  - Cycle 4: 5-7-4-5
  - Cycle 5: 9-7-6-9
  - Cycle 6: 6-4-8-6
  - Cycle 7: 6-2-4-6
  - Cycle 8: 6-7-0-6
  - Cycle 9: 4-7-0-4
  - Cycle 10: 4-8-2-4
  - Cycle 11: 7-0-3-7
  - Cycle 12: 7-1-2-7
  - Cycle 13: 1-3-0-1
  - Cycle 14: 1-2-3-1
  - Cycle 15: 3-9-5-3
  - Cycle 16: 3-1-2-3
  - Cycle 17: 8-4-2-8
  - Cycle 18: 2-3-0-2

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
  - Chordal 4-cycles:
    - <5, (3, 9), 5>
    - <5, (4, 6), 5>
    - <5, (4, 7), 5>
    - <9, (7, 6), 9>
    - <6, (4, 8), 6>
    - <6, (2, 4), 6>
    - <6, (7, 0), 6>
    - <4, (7, 0), 4>
    - <4, (8, 2), 4>
    - <7, (0, 3), 7>
    - <7, (1, 2), 7>
    - <1, (3, 0), 1>
    - <1, (2, 3), 1>
    - <3, (5, 9), 3>
    - <3, (1, 2), 3>
    - <8, (4, 2), 8>
    - <2, (3, 0), 2>

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [17]
