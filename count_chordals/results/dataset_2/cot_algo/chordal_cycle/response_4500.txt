Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (2, 10) (18, 8) (18, 5) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 14) (5, 19) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 7) (12, 15) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 3) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. 

1. <8, 13, 1, 17> with non-adjacent chords (1, 17)
2. <10, 11, 19, 5> with non-adjacent chords (11, 5)
3. <14, 4, 8, 11> with non-adjacent chords (4, 11)

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
