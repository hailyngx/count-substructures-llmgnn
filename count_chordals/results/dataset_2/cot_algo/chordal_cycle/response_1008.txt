Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 10, 13, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 10, 4, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 2, 9, 11, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 1, 11, 6, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 13, 10, 12, 5)
- Cycle 6: (9, 4, 10, 11, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 11, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 14, 3, 0, 9)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 11, 2, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 10, 12, 3, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 7, 12, 10, 4)
- Cycle 12: (7, 12, 10, 10, 7)
- Cycle 13: (10, 13, 5, 1, 10)
- Cycle 14: (10, 11, 9, 2, 10)
- Cycle 15: (11, 6, 8, 4, 11)
- Cycle 16: (11, 2, 5, 10, 11)
- Cycle 17: (8, 6, 1, 0, 8)
- Cycle 18: (8, 3, 12, 7, 8)
- Cycle 19: (13, 5, 1, 11, 13)
- Cycle 20: (12, 10, 4, 8, 12)
- Cycle 21: (12, 3, 14, 9, 12)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <5, (10, 13), 5>: Chord (10, 13)
- Cycle 2 <5, (10, 4), 9, 5>: Chord (10, 4)
- Cycle 4 <5, 1, (11, 6), 5>: Chord (11, 6)
- Cycle 10 <4, 10, (12, 3), 4>: Chord (12, 3)
- Cycle 11 <4, (7, 12), 10, 4>: Chord (7, 12)
- Cycle 14 <10, (11, 9), 2, 10>: Chord (11, 9)
- Cycle 15 <11, (6, 8), 4, 11>: Chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 16 <11, 2, (5, 10), 11>: Chord (5, 10)
- Cycle 18 <8, (3, 12), 7, 8>: Chord (3, 12)
- Cycle 19 <13, 5, (1, 11), 13>: Chord (1, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [12]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<5, (10, 13), 5>
<5, (10, 4), 9, 5>
<5, 1, (11, 6), 5>
<4, 10, (12, 3), 4>
<4, (7, 12), 10, 4>
<10, (11, 9), 2, 10>
<11, (6, 8), 4, 11>
<11, 2, (5, 10), 11>
<8, (3, 12), 7, 8>
<13, 5, (1, 11), 13>
<6, 1, (0, 8), 6>
