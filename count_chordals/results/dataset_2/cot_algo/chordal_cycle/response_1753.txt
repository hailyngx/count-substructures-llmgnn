Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <2, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 2: <0, 2, 7, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 6, 8>
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 7, 3>
- Cycle 5: <3, 5, 9, 0>
- Cycle 6: <3, 7, 4, 6>

Step 2:
- Checking for exactly one chord:
    - Cycle 1 <2, 5, 8, 9> has a chord (8, 5)
    - Cycle 2 <0, 2, 7, 1> has a chord (7, 2)
    - Cycle 3 <0, 4, 6, 8> has a chord (6, 4)
    - Cycle 4 <1, 2, 7, 3> has a chord (7, 2)
    - Cycle 5 <3, 5, 9, 0> has a chord (9, 5)
    - Cycle 6 <3, 7, 4, 6> has a chord (4, 7)

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [6]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <2, 5, 8, 9>
- <0, 2, 7, 1>
- <0, 4, 6, 8>
- <1, 2, 7, 3>
- <3, 5, 9, 0>
- <3, 7, 4, 6>
