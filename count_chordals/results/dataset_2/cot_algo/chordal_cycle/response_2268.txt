Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 3) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 16) (3, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 8) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 13) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 2) (8, 15) (8, 14) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 18) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 0) (13, 3) (13, 19) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. (11, 9, 5, 4, 1, 6, 11)
2. (11, 9, 12, 7, 17, 11)
3. (1, 15, 12, 9, 5, 4, 1)
4. (2, 0, 17, 11, 9, 12, 10, 18, 14, 2)
5. (3, 16, 4, 5, 9, 12, 15, 7, 17, 3)
6. (6, 1, 15, 12, 7, 17, 0, 2, 14, 18, 6)
7. (19, 0, 17, 7, 15, 1, 4, 5, 17, 13, 19)
8. (13, 3, 16, 4, 5, 9, 12, 7, 18, 10, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, 6, 11, 9> with chord (5, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 7 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
