Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 15) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 13) (17, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 10) (18, 5) (18, 15) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 19) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 10) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 0) (5, 18) (5, 2) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 18) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 2) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

In this graph, there are several cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 8 - 11 - 16 - 15 - 8
- Cycle 2: 8 - 15 - 16 - 4 - 13 - 8
- Cycle 3: 10 - 19 - 3 - 7 - 10
- Cycle 4: 2 - 6 - 13 - 17 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 5: 12 - 0 - 4 - 13 - 8 - 12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

In the cycles listed above:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: 16 - 8
- Cycle 2 has a chord: 16 - 8
- Cycle 3 has a chord: 19 - 7
- Cycle 4 has a chord: 13 - 2
- Cycle 5 has a chord: 4 - 8

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

<12, 0, 4, (13, 8)>
