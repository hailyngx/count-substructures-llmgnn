Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (1, 5, 10, 3, 1) 
        - Cycle 2: (1, 5, 6, 14, 1) 
        - Cycle 3: (1, 5, 6, 12, 3, 1) 
        - Cycle 4: (1, 5, 6, 9, 11, 1) 
        - Cycle 5: (1, 5, 6, 11, 8, 1) 
        - Cycle 6: (1, 5, 2, 12, 3, 1) 
        - Cycle 7: (1, 5, 2, 13, 1) 
        - Cycle 8: (1, 5, 2, 14, 1) 
        - Cycle 9: (1, 5, 10, 7, 4, 0, 1) 
        - Cycle 10: (1, 5, 10, 7, 6, 9, 11, 1) 
        - Cycle 11: (1, 5, 10, 7, 6, 12, 3, 1) 
        - Cycle 12: (1, 5, 10, 7, 6, 14, 2, 1) 
        - Cycle 13: (1, 5, 10, 7, 6, 4, 0, 1) 
        - Cycle 14: (1, 5, 2, 14, 8, 11, 1) 
        - Cycle 15: (1, 5, 2, 14, 13, 0, 1) 
        - Cycle 16: (1, 3, 12, 2, 5, 1) 
        - Cycle 17: (1, 3, 12, 6, 5, 1) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Chordal Cycle 1: <1, (3, 12), 2, 5> 
        - Chordal Cycle 2: <1, (5, 6), 14, 2> 
        - Chordal Cycle 3: <1, (5, 10), 7, 6> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

        There are [3] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
