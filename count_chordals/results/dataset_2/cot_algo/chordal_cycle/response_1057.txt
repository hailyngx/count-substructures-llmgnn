Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 28) (9, 13) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 11) (27, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 20) (11, 27) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 29) (20, 10) (20, 18) (20, 5) (25, 23) (25, 4) (25, 28) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 18) (22, 6) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 2) (24, 29) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 4) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 17) (2, 12) (2, 24) (2, 6) (1, 0) (1, 19) (6, 22) (6, 2) (6, 4) (16, 0) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 19) (23, 25) (23, 29) (21, 15) (21, 16) (21, 4) (13, 9) (13, 16) (17, 7) (17, 28) (17, 19) (28, 9) (28, 25) (28, 17) (14, 19) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 16) (5, 20) (5, 4) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 17) (19, 14) (8, 27) (29, 15) (29, 11) (29, 24) (29, 23) (4, 25) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (9, 28, 25, 4) with edges (9, 28), (28, 25), (25, 4), (4, 9)
- Cycle 2: (15, 27, 12, 2) with edges (15, 27), (27, 12), (12, 2), (2, 15)
- Cycle 3: (10, 11, 27, 24) with edges (10, 11), (11, 27), (27, 24), (24, 10)
- Cycle 4: (20, 10, 11, 3) with edges (20, 10), (10, 11), (11, 3), (3, 20)
- Cycle 5: (25, 23, 29, 15) with edges (25, 23), (23, 29), (29, 15), (15, 25)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (28, 4)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (27, 2)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (11, 24)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (10, 3)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (23, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, all cycles have exactly one chord, so there are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <(9, 28), (28, 25), 25, 4)>
- <(15, 27), (27, 12), 12, 2>
- <(10, 11), (11, 27), 27, 24>
- <(20, 10), (10, 11), 11, 3>
- <(25, 23), (23, 29), 29, 15>
