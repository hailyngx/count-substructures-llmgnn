Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 17) (26, 13) (26, 21) (26, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 10) (21, 26) (21, 5) (21, 15) (6, 9) (6, 19) (6, 20) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 14) (2, 25) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 11) (13, 26) (13, 25) (13, 28) (13, 19) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 0) (17, 22) (4, 27) (4, 24) (27, 4) (27, 23) (15, 21) (15, 0) (15, 25) (7, 25) (7, 28) (25, 2) (25, 13) (25, 15) (25, 7) (11, 29) (11, 12) (23, 2) (23, 27) (23, 19) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 22) (10, 14) (18, 16) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 23) (22, 17) (22, 10) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 12) (24, 4) (24, 0) (0, 26) (0, 17) (0, 15) (0, 24) (28, 13) (28, 17) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 14) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 5) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 28) (5, 21) (5, 3) (5, 16) (8, 10) (8, 20) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 28) (20, 6) (20, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (9, 6, 19, 13, 26, 21, 15, 25) with 7 edges
- Cycle 2: (9, 6, 19, 23, 2, 29, 11, 12, 3, 16, 1, 17, 0, 26) with 13 edges
- Cycle 3: (9, 29, 2, 14, 28, 13, 26) with 6 edges
- Cycle 4: (9, 29, 11, 12, 3, 5, 21, 26) with 7 edges
- Cycle 5: (9, 17, 1, 16, 5, 3, 12, 11, 29) with 8 edges
- Cycle 6: (9, 17, 1, 16, 18, 3, 12, 28, 14, 2, 29) with 10 edges
- Cycle 7: (9, 17, 1, 10, 22, 17) with 5 edges
- Cycle 8: (26, 0, 17, 22, 10, 8, 20, 6) with 7 edges
- Cycle 9: (26, 21, 15, 0, 24, 4, 27, 23, 19) with 8 edges
- Cycle 10: (26, 13, 19, 23, 27, 4, 24, 0) with 7 edges
- Cycle 11: (26, 21, 5, 3, 16, 18, 16, 1, 10, 22) with 9 edges
- Cycle 12: (26, 21, 5, 16, 1, 17, 17, 28, 14, 2) with 9 edges
- Cycle 13: (26, 13, 19, 23, 27, 23, 2, 14, 28) with 8 edges

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
From the listed cycles, the chordal 4-cycle found is:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <(9, 6), (19, 13)> with chord (26, 21)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There is a total of [1] unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph.
