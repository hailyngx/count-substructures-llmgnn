Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 14) (8, 19) (8, 16) (13, 12) (13, 19) (13, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 15) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 11) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 14) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 10) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 0) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 14) (10, 16) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 

There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the given graph, including:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-14-13-4
- Cycle 2: 4-5-19-13-4
- Cycle 3: 4-1-18-2-4
- Cycle 4: 5-6-3-12-5
- Cycle 5: 5-11-19-13-5
- Cycle 6: 5-17-15-11-5
- Cycle 7: 6-3-12-13-6
- Cycle 8: 2-18-1-4-2
- Cycle 9: 3-6-5-19-3
- Cycle 10: 11-5-4-1-11
- Cycle 11: 1-18-2-16-1
- Cycle 12: 18-2-16-10-18
- Cycle 13: 19-13-12-14-19
- Cycle 14: 9-3-6-5-9
- Cycle 15: 9-15-17-5-9
- Cycle 16: 16-8-19-13-16
- Cycle 17: 0-1-4-5-0
- Cycle 18: 0-15-17-5-0
- Cycle 19: 15-11-5-6-15
- Cycle 20: 12-3-6-5-12

Step 2:

After checking all the cycles, the only chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <1, (18, 4, 2), 11>

Step 3:

There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
