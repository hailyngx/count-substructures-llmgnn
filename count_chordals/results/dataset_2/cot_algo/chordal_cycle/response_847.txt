Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (14, 11) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
<0, 4, 10, 8>, <4, 10, 7, 5>, <10, 7, 11, 9>, <7, 11, 3, 12>, <11, 3, 7, 5>, <3, 7, 6, 12>, <7, 6, 9, 2>, <6, 12, 1, 8>, <12, 1, 2, 9>, <1, 8, 0, 4>, <8, 0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 11, 14>, <4, 11, 14, 13>, <11, 14, 13, 2>, <14, 13, 12, 3>, <13, 12, 6, 9>, <12, 6, 7, 3>, <6, 7, 5, 2>, <7, 5, 4, 0>, <5, 4, 11, 9>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <0, 4, 10, 8> (chord: (8, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <4, 10, 7, 5> (chord: (5, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <10, 7, 11, 9> (chord: (9, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <7, 11, 3, 12> (chord: (11, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <11, 3, 7, 5> (chord: (5, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <3, 7, 6, 12> (chord: (7, 12))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <7, 6, 9, 2> (chord: (6, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <6, 12, 1, 8> (chord: (12, 1))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <12, 1, 2, 9> (chord: (1, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <1, 8, 0, 4> (chord: (8, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <8, 0, 2, 5> (chord: (0, 5))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <0, 4, 11, 14> (chord: (4, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <4, 11, 14, 13> (chord: (11, 14))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <11, 14, 13, 2> (chord: (14, 2))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <14, 13, 12, 3> (chord: (13, 12))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <13, 12, 6, 9> (chord: (12, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <12, 6, 7, 3> (chord: (6, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <6, 7, 5, 2> (chord: (7, 5))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <7, 5, 4, 0> (chord: (5, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <5, 4, 11, 9> (chord: (4, 11))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [20]
