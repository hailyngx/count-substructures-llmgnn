Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1-5-4-7-6-1
2. Cycle 2-9-8-7-4-2
3. Cycle 2-9-6-3-0-4-2
4. Cycle 0-9-6-3-2-8-4-0

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, (6, 7), 4>
2. <2, (4, 7), 9>
3. <2, (6, 3), 9>
4. <0, (3, 2), 9>

Step 3:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
