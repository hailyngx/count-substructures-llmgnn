Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
1. Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 2, 5)
2. Cycle 2: (5, 9, 0, 2, 5)
3. Cycle 3: (5, 9, 0, 6, 5)
4. Cycle 4: (5, 9, 3, 2, 5)
5. Cycle 5: (5, 9, 3, 1, 5)
6. Cycle 6: (8, 3, 2, 6, 8)
7. Cycle 7: (8, 3, 2, 0, 8)
8. Cycle 8: (8, 3, 9, 5, 8)
9. Cycle 9: (8, 3, 9, 1, 8)
10. Cycle 10: (8, 4, 3, 2, 8)
11. Cycle 11: (8, 4, 6, 0, 8)
12. Cycle 12: (8, 4, 6, 2, 8)

Step 2:
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following chordal 4-cycles:
1. <5, (9, 1), 2>
2. <5, (9, 0), 2>
3. <5, (9, 3), 1>
4. <8, (3, 2), 6>
5. <8, (3, 9), 5>
6. <8, (4, 3), 2>
7. <8, (4, 6), 0>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have found a total of [7] unique chordal 4-cycles.
