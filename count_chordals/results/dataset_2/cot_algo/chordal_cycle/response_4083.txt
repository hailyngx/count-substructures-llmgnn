Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 9) (27, 19) (3, 25) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 2) (22, 23) (22, 28) (23, 15) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 28) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 29) (6, 26) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 26) (21, 12) (21, 29) (11, 23) (4, 3) (4, 17) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 2) (12, 17) (2, 25) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 28) (1, 10) (1, 8) (29, 6) (29, 21) (29, 13) (9, 27) (9, 2) (26, 6) (26, 7) (26, 8) (20, 18) (20, 16) (8, 1) (8, 26) (8, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 12) (19, 27) (19, 0) (19, 7) (19, 24) (13, 29) (13, 14) (16, 25) (16, 20) (16, 18) (16, 10) (28, 22) (28, 23) (28, 2) (18, 20) (18, 16) (18, 24) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 16) (10, 24) (24, 19) (24, 18) (24, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        Cycle 1: (15, 27, 19, 0) 
        Cycle 2: (15, 27, 19, 24) 
        Cycle 3: (27, 19, 0, 7) 
        Cycle 4: (15, 27, 9, 2) 
        Cycle 5: (3, 25, 2, 12) 
        Cycle 6: (5, 3, 25, 2) 
        Cycle 7: (5, 3, 25, 16) 
        Cycle 8: (5, 6, 29, 21) 
        Cycle 9: (6, 26, 8, 14) 
        Cycle 10: (7, 0, 17, 12) 
        Cycle 11: (23, 15, 27, 9) 
        Cycle 12: (23, 15, 12, 21) 
        Cycle 13: (2, 25, 3, 4) 
        Cycle 14: (2, 25, 16, 20) 
        Cycle 15: (2, 12, 17, 4) 
        Cycle 16: (2, 12, 21, 29) 
        Cycle 17: (29, 6, 5, 10) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - Only Cycle 16: (2, 12, 21, 29) has exactly one chord, which is (12, 29).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        The number of unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord in the graph is [1].

        The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <2, (12, 29), 21>.
