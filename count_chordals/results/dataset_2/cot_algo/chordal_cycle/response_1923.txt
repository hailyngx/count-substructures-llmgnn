Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 15) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 19) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 7) (18, 12) (18, 0) (19, 6) (19, 12) (14, 4) (14, 11) (0, 6) (0, 18) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 2: 1-5-3-11-17-8-13-2-11-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-3-16-7-15-1
- Cycle 4: 1-5-12-18-0-6-9-4-13-2-11-1
- Cycle 5: 1-5-12-18-0-6-17-8-13-2-11-1
- Cycle 6: 1-11-2-13-4-9-6-17-8-13-2
- Cycle 7: 1-11-14-4-9-6-17-8-13-2-11
- Cycle 8: 3-5-12-18-0-6-9-4-13-2-11-3
- Cycle 9: 3-11-17-8-13-2-11-14-4-9-6-3
- Cycle 10: 7-9-6-17-8-13-2-11-14-4-7
- Cycle 11: 7-15-1-5-12-10-17-8-13-15
- Cycle 12: 7-15-1-11-2-13-4-9-6-17-7
- Cycle 13: 16-3-11-2-13-4-9-6-17-8-16
- Cycle 14: 16-7-9-6-17-8-13-2-11-3-16
- Cycle 15: 16-8-13-4-9-6-17-11-2-13-16

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (5, 12), 10, 17, 8, 13, 2, 11>
- <1, (5, 3), 11, 17, 8, 13, 2, 11>
- <1, (5, 3), 16, 7, 15>
- <1, (5, 12), 18, 0, 6, 9, 4, 13, 2, 11>
- <1, (5, 12), 18, 0, 6, 17, 8, 13, 2, 11>
- <1, 11, 2, 13, 4, 9, 6, 17, 8, 13>
- <1, 11, 14, 4, 9, 6, 17, 8, 13, 2>
- <3, (5, 12), 18, 0, 6, 9, 4, 13, 2, 11>
- <3, 11, 17, 8, 13, 2, 11, 14, 4, 9, 6>
- <7, 9, 6, 17, 8, 13, 2, 11, 14, 4>
- <7, 15, 1, 5, 12, 10, 17, 8, 13, 15>
- <7, 15, 1, 11, 2, 13, 4, 9, 6, 17>
- <16, 3, 11, 2, 13, 4, 9, 6, 17, 8>
- <16, 7, 9, 6, 17, 8, 13, 2, 11, 3>
- <16, 8, 13, 4, 9, 6, 17, 11, 2, 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [15].
