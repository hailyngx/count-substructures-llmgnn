Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

There are several cycles in the graph, but we are interested in cycles of length 4 or more. 

One such cycle, for example, is: 
- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 7, 3, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

In Cycle 1, the chord is the edge between vertices 5 and 3, which is (5, 3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

We have found 0 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (5, 3), 7>
