Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 6 - 9 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 6 - 4 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 7 - 4 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 5: 5 - 2 - 0 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 6: 5 - 1 - 4 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 7: 9 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 8: 9 - 6 - 0 - 2 - 9
- Cycle 9: 9 - 6 - 5 - 2 - 9
- Cycle 10: 4 - 7 - 5 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 11: 4 - 7 - 6 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 12: 4 - 1 - 5 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 13: 4 - 1 - 8 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 14: 7 - 4 - 1 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 15: 7 - 4 - 1 - 5 - 7
- Cycle 16: 7 - 5 - 6 - 9 - 7
- Cycle 17: 7 - 5 - 1 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 18: 7 - 6 - 5 - 7
- Cycle 19: 7 - 6 - 8 - 1 - 7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 1: 5 - 6 - 9 - 2 - 5 has exactly one chord 9 - 2.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

The unique chordal 4-cycle is <5, 6, 9, 2>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
