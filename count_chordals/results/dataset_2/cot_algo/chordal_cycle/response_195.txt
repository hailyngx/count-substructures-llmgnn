Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 17) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 19) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 15) (2, 19) (2, 13) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 15) (1, 18) (1, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (13, 0) (13, 2) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 16) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle <5, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle <5, 9, 8, 12>
- Cycle <5, 9, 7, 14>
- Cycle <5, 9, 8, 6>
- Cycle <5, 9, 7, 11>
- Cycle <9, 8, 6, 16>
- Cycle <9, 8, 12, 11>
- Cycle <9, 8, 12, 11, 7>
- Cycle <9, 8, 12, 11, 3>
- Cycle <9, 7, 14, 10>
- Cycle <9, 7, 3, 17>
- Cycle <9, 7, 3, 11>
- Cycle <9, 7, 3, 17, 15>
- Cycle <4, 17, 3, 11>
- Cycle <18, 16, 3, 11>
- Cycle <18, 16, 8, 12>
- Cycle <18, 16, 3, 17>
- Cycle <18, 16, 15, 17>
- Cycle <3, 11, 7, 14>
- Cycle <3, 11, 12, 8>
- Cycle <3, 11, 7, 9>
- Cycle <3, 11, 12, 8, 6>
- Cycle <3, 7, 9, 5>
- Cycle <3, 7, 11, 12>
- Cycle <3, 17, 15, 18>
- Cycle <11, 12, 8, 9>
- Cycle <8, 6, 19, 2>
- Cycle <8, 6, 19, 3>
- Cycle <12, 11, 3, 19>
- Cycle <12, 11, 7, 14>
- Cycle <0, 5, 9, 7>
- Cycle <0, 10, 14, 7>  

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 9, 8, 6>, chord (8, 6)

Step 3:
The final number of chordless cycles found is [32].
