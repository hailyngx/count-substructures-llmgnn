Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-4-9-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-4-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-4-8-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-4-8-1
- Cycle 5: 6-4-9-7-6
- Cycle 6: 6-4-9-0-6
- Cycle 7: 6-4-8-7-6
- Cycle 8: 6-4-8-3-6
- Cycle 9: 6-4-5-7-6
- Cycle 10: 6-4-5-7-8
- Cycle 11: 6-4-2-3-6
- Cycle 12: 6-4-2-0-6
- Cycle 13: 6-4-1-9-6
- Cycle 14: 6-4-1-3-6
- Cycle 15: 6-1-9-4-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, 4, 9, 6> (Chord: (1, 6))
2. <1, 4, 8, 6> (Chord: (1, 8))
3. <6, 4, 9, 7> (Chord: (6, 7))
4. <6, 4, 9, 0> (Chord: (6, 0))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
