Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
    - There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:  
      <1, 5, 3, 2>  
      <1, 5, 3, 7>  
      <1, 5, 7, 2>  
      <1, 4, 2, 3>  
      <1, 4, 2, 8>  
      <1, 4, 2, 7>  
      <1, 4, 9, 7>  
      <1, 4, 9, 0>  
      <3, 2, 8, 6>  
      <3, 2, 8, 0>  
      <3, 2, 4, 9>  
      <3, 2, 4, 1>  
      <3, 2, 7, 9>  
      <3, 2, 7, 5>  
      <5, 7, 2, 4>  
      <5, 7, 2, 8>  
      <5, 7, 3, 2>  
      <5, 7, 3, 1>  
      <5, 7, 9, 4>  
      <5, 7, 9, 0>  

Step 2: 
    - Among the cycles listed above, the only chordal 4-cycle is:  
      <1, 4, 9, 7>  
      Chord: (1, 7)  

Step 3: 
    - The number of chordless cycles found is 0, since the only 4-cycle found has a chord.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
