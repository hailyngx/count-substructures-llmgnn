Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 15) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 18) (9, 2) (9, 7) (3, 4) (7, 9) (7, 10) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 4) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 11) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 12) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 16) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 1) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 0) (16, 14) (16, 10) (12, 19) (12, 1) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 11) (18, 0) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 10 - 7 - 9 - 2 - 1 - 13 - 4 - 6 - 14 - 8 - 15 - 17 - 11 - 0 - 18 - 5
- Cycle 2: 4 - 3 - 6 - 14 - 8 - 18 - 0 - 11 - 17 - 19 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 3 - 6 - 14 - 16 - 10 - 7 - 9 - 2 - 1 - 13 - 15 - 17 - 19 - 12 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 4: 5 - 15 - 17 - 19 - 12 - 1 - 2 - 9 - 7 - 10 - 16 - 14 - 6 - 4 - 13 - 15 - 5

Step 2:
- Only Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (15, 12)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, (15, 12), 17, 19, (12, 1)>
