Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 19) (5, 15) (9, 16) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (0, 7) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (15, 5) (15, 10) (15, 14) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 19) (6, 11) (6, 19) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 18) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 3) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 3) (18, 10) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 8) (13, 7) (13, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle: <0, 7, 1, 17, 3, 4, 2, 11>
- Cycle: <0, 7, 1, 14, 3, 18, 10, 15>
- Cycle: <0, 7, 8, 12, 16, 4, 2, 11>
- Cycle: <0, 7, 13, 18, 10, 15, 5>
- Cycle: <2, 14, 9, 16, 4, 3, 18, 10>
- Cycle: <2, 14, 3, 17, 1, 8, 12, 16>
- Cycle: <2, 11, 6, 19, 16, 4, 3, 17>
- Cycle: <3, 17, 1, 14, 15, 10, 18, 13>
- Cycle: <4, 16, 12, 8, 1, 7, 13, 18>
- Cycle: <4, 3, 14, 15, 10, 9, 16, 12>
- Cycle: <5, 15, 10, 9, 16, 12, 8, 1>
- Cycle: <6, 11, 2, 4, 16, 9, 10, 15>
- Cycle: <6, 19, 16, 12, 8, 1, 7, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 7, (1, 8), 12, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 7, (3, 18), 10, 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 7, (8, 12), 16, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 14, (9, 16), 4, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 3, (14, 15), 10, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 15, (10, 9), 16, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 19, (12, 8), 1, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
