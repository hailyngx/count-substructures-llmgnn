Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 1 - 8 - 0
2. Cycle 2: 0 - 3 - 8 - 1 - 0
3. Cycle 3: 3 - 8 - 7 - 12 - 3
4. Cycle 4: 3 - 8 - 1 - 6 - 3
5. Cycle 5: 5 - 13 - 9 - 1 - 5
6. Cycle 6: 5 - 13 - 11 - 2 - 5
7. Cycle 7: 6 - 5 - 13 - 11 - 6
8. Cycle 8: 6 - 5 - 2 - 12 - 6
9. Cycle 9: 6 - 1 - 4 - 7 - 6
10. Cycle 10: 9 - 13 - 5 - 6 - 9
11. Cycle 11: 9 - 13 - 11 - 3 - 9
12. Cycle 12: 9 - 1 - 6 - 12 - 9
13. Cycle 13: 10 - 5 - 2 - 11 - 10
14. Cycle 14: 10 - 9 - 1 - 4 - 10
15. Cycle 15: 10 - 9 - 13 - 5 - 10

Step 2:
- Out of these 15 cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, (0, 8), 4>
2. <2, (5, 12), 11>

Step 3:
- There are a total of [2] chordless 4-cycles in the graph.
