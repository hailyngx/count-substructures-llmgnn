Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 15) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (18, 6) (18, 15) (19, 15) (19, 0) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 19) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 19) (3, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 0-6-4-7-1-2
        - Cycle 2: 0-6-4-14-12-7
        - Cycle 3: 0-6-4-14-13-1
        - Cycle 4: 0-6-4-7-10-3
        - Cycle 5: 6-4-7-1-13-14
        - Cycle 6: 6-4-7-10-3-9
        - Cycle 7: 6-4-14-13-1-2
        - Cycle 8: 6-4-14-12-7-10
        - Cycle 9: 9-6-4-14-13-1
        - Cycle 10: 9-6-4-7-10-3
        - Cycle 11: 9-6-4-14-12-7
        - Cycle 12: 4-7-10-3-9-6
        - Cycle 13: 4-14-13-1-2-8
        - Cycle 14: 4-14-12-7-10-3
        - Cycle 15: 7-1-13-14-12-4
        - Cycle 16: 7-10-3-9-6-4
        - Cycle 17: 14-13-1-2-8-9
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord (1,4)
        - Cycle 2 has a chord (4,7)
        - Cycle 3 has a chord (1,13)
        - Cycle 4 has a chord (4,10)
        - Cycle 5 has a chord (1,14)
        - Cycle 6 has a chord (4,9)
        - Cycle 7 has a chord (1,2)
        - Cycle 8 has a chord (7,10)
        - Cycle 9 has a chord (1,13)
        - Cycle 10 has a chord (4,10)
        - Cycle 11 has a chord (4,12)
        - Cycle 12 has a chord (4,9)
        - Cycle 13 has a chord (1,2)
        - Cycle 14 has a chord (4,12)
        - Cycle 15 has a chord (1,14)
        - Cycle 16 has a chord (4,9)
        - Cycle 17 has a chord (1,9)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 17 chordal 4-cycles found. 
        
Therefore, the final number of chordless cycles found is [3]. The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <6, 4, 7, 10> with the chord (4,9).
