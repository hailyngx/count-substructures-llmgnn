Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 6, 4, 7, 9)
- Cycle 3: (6, 4, 7, 1, 6)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 3, 8, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 1, 2, 8, 7)
- Cycle 6: (1, 2, 0, 9, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 0, 3, 8, 2)
- Cycle 8: (0, 3, 6, 9, 0)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 2: Chord (6, 7)
- Cycle 3: Chord (4, 1)
- Cycle 4: Chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 5: Chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 6: Chord (2, 9)
- Cycle 7: Chord (0, 3)
- Cycle 8: Chord (3, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, (9, 4), 6>
<6, (6, 7), 4>
<4, (4, 1), 7>
<7, (7, 8), 3>
<1, (1, 2), 6>
<2, (2, 9), 1>
<0, (0, 3), 8>
<3, (3, 6), 0>
