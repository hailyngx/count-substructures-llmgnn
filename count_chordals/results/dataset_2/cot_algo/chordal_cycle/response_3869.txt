Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 8) (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 22) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 17) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 26) (22, 1) (22, 23) (23, 21) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 17) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (2, 3) (2, 26) (2, 28) (19, 1) (19, 26) (19, 0) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 19) (9, 15) (9, 20) (9, 27) (29, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 4) (14, 25) (7, 10) (7, 11) (6, 14) (6, 4) (18, 21) (18, 23) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 20) (4, 14) (4, 6) (12, 21) (12, 25) (12, 0) (24, 27) (24, 17) (27, 9) (27, 24) (27, 17) (27, 5) (20, 9) (20, 18) (5, 27) (5, 25) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 28) (17, 21) (17, 23) (17, 24) (17, 27) (0, 19) (0, 29) (0, 12) (28, 1) (28, 2) (28, 25) (16, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1 - 21 - 12 - 25 (Chords: 21, 25)
- Cycle 2: 1 - 21 - 23 - 17 (Chords: 21, 17)
- Cycle 3: 1 - 21 - 18 - 11 (Chords: 21, 11)
- Cycle 4: 1 - 22 - 23 - 17 (Chords: 22, 17)
- Cycle 5: 1 - 22 - 23 - 18 (Chords: 22, 18)
- Cycle 6: 1 - 28 - 25 - 14 (Chords: 28, 14)
- Cycle 7: 21 - 1 - 10 - 7 (Chords: 1, 7)
- Cycle 8: 21 - 23 - 18 - 14 (Chords: 23, 14)
- Cycle 9: 21 - 23 - 17 - 27 (Chords: 23, 27)
- Cycle 10: 26 - 2 - 28 - 25 (Chords: 2, 28)
- Cycle 11: 26 - 15 - 9 - 20 (Chords: 15, 9)
- Cycle 12: 26 - 19 - 1 - 21 (Chords: 19, 1)
- Cycle 13: 26 - 19 - 0 - 12 (Chords: 19, 12)
- Cycle 14: 27 - 17 - 23 - 21 (Chords: 17, 21)
- Cycle 15: 27 - 17 - 24 - 27 (Chords: 17, 24)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle
- <1, 21, 12, 25> has 2 chords
- <1, 21, 23, 17> has 2 chords
- <1, 21, 18, 11> has 2 chords
- <1, 22, 23, 17> has 2 chords
- <1, 22, 23, 18> has 2 chords
- <1, 28, 25, 14> has 2 chords
- <21, 1, 10, 7> has 2 chords
- <21, 23, 18, 14> has 2 chords
- <21, 23, 17, 27> has 2 chords
- <26, 2, 28, 25> has 2 chords
- <26, 15, 9, 20> has 2 chords
- <26, 19, 1, 21> has 2 chords
- <26, 19, 0, 12> has 2 chords
- <27, 17, 23, 21> has 2 chords
- <27, 17, 24, 27> has 2 chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found
Since all cycles have 2 chords each, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [0].
