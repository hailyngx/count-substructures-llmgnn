- Cycle 17: (0, 8, 2, 6) with edges (0, 8), (8, 2), (2, 6), and (6, 0)
- Cycle 18: (0, 13, 8, 4) with edges (0, 13), (13, 8), (8, 4), and (4, 0)
- Cycle 19: (5, 0, 13, 8) with edges (5, 0), (0, 13), (13, 8), and (8, 5)
- Cycle 20: (9, 7, 6, 4) with edges (9, 7), (7, 6), (6, 4), and (4, 9)
- Cycle 21: (9, 11, 8, 4) with edges (9, 11), (11, 8), (8, 4), and (4, 9)
- Cycle 22: (12, 14, 4, 6) with edges (12, 14), (14, 4), (4, 6), and (6, 12)
- Cycle 23: (1, 10, 8, 4) with edges (1, 10), (10, 8), (8, 4), and (4, 1)
- Cycle 24: (1, 5, 3, 4) with edges (1, 5), (5, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 1)

- Cycle 26: (1, 7, 2, 3) with edges (1, 7), (7, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 1)
- Cycle 27: (1, 12, 9, 4) with edges (1, 12), (12, 9), (9, 4), and (4, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Considering the above cycles, we find that there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since there are no chordal 4-cycles in the graph, the count is [0].
