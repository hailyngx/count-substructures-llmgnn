Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 4-8-2-5
- Cycle 2: 4-5-6-8
- Cycle 3: 5-6-1-4
- Cycle 4: 5-2-3-7
- Cycle 5: 5-1-9-4
- Cycle 6: 5-7-0-3

Step 2:

Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord (4, 2)
- Cycle 2 has chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 3 has chord (6, 4)
- Cycle 4 has chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 5 has chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 6 has chord (5, 0)

Step 3:

Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<4, (2, 8), 5>
<5, (4, 8), 6>
<6, (4, 6), 5>
<2, (3, 7), 5>
<1, (4, 1), 5>
<5, (0, 5), 3>
