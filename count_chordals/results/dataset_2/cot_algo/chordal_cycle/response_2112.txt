- Cycle 2: (1, 13, 16, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 13, 8, 7)
- Cycle 4: (1, 13, 8, 9)
- Cycle 5: (1, 17, 15, 29)
- Cycle 6: (2, 27, 23, 3)
- Cycle 7: (2, 10, 26, 17)
- Cycle 8: (3, 28, 21, 19)
- Cycle 9: (4, 12, 6, 21)
- Cycle 10: (4, 12, 24, 16)
- Cycle 11: (5, 19, 21, 6)
- Cycle 12: (5, 19, 22, 9)
- Cycle 13: (5, 19, 21, 25)
- Cycle 14: (6, 28, 22, 9)
- Cycle 15: (6, 28, 21, 19)
- Cycle 16: (6, 28, 21, 25)
- Cycle 17: (7, 8, 9, 22)
- Cycle 18: (7, 8, 13, 16)
- Cycle 19: (7, 24, 16, 0)
- Cycle 20: (8, 13, 16, 24)
- Cycle 21: (11, 17, 1, 13)
- Cycle 22: (11, 15, 25, 21)
- Cycle 23: (11, 15, 29, 26)
- Cycle 24: (12, 24, 16, 0)
- Cycle 25: (15, 17, 1, 13)
- Cycle 26: (15, 17, 26, 10)
- Cycle 27: (15, 25, 21, 19)
- Cycle 28: (15, 25, 21, 6)
- Cycle 29: (17, 26, 10, 2)
- Cycle 30: (19, 18, 21, 28)

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (13, 16), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (13, 8), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (13, 8), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (27, 23), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, (12, 24), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <7, (8, 13), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <11, (15, 25), 21>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 30 cycles and 7 of them have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 30 - 7 = 23.

Final Answer: [23]
