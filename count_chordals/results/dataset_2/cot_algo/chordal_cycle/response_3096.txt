Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. (5, 2, 6, 0)
2. (5, 2, 8, 3)
3. (5, 2, 1, 9)
4. (5, 8, 7, 1)
5. (5, 8, 3, 6)
6. (5, 3, 6, 0)
7. (9, 1, 0, 6)
8. (9, 1, 7, 8)
9. (9, 7, 6, 0)
10. (6, 7, 9, 1)
11. (6, 7, 8, 5)
12. (6, 3, 8, 2)
13. (6, 0, 1, 9)
14. (2, 5, 3, 6)
15. (2, 5, 8, 7)
16. (2, 6, 4, 1)
17. (2, 6, 7, 9)
18. (2, 8, 7, 6)
19. (2, 8, 3, 5)
20. (8, 5, 3, 6)
21. (8, 5, 2, 6)
22. (8, 7, 6, 3)
23. (8, 7, 1, 9)
24. (0, 9, 7, 6)
25. (0, 9, 1, 2)
26. (0, 6, 3, 5)
27. (0, 6, 7, 8)
28. (7, 9, 1, 0)
29. (7, 9, 6, 3)
30. (3, 5, 2, 6)
31. (3, 5, 8, 7)
32. (3, 6, 7, 8)
33. (3, 6, 0, 9)
34. (1, 9, 7, 6)
35. (1, 9, 0, 6)
36. (1, 7, 8, 5)
37. (1, 7, 6, 3)
38. (1, 4, 6, 2)
39. (4, 6, 0, 9)
40. (4, 2, 6, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, (4, 2), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is only 1 chordless cycle found, so the final answer is [1].
