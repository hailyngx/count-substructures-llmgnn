Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-2-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-3-6
- Cycle 3: 6-9-1-6
- Cycle 4: 6-9-7-6
- Cycle 5: 6-2-4-6
- Cycle 6: 6-2-8-6
- Cycle 7: 6-2-4-7
- Cycle 8: 6-2-8-0
- Cycle 9: 6-7-4-6
- Cycle 10: 6-7-3-6
- Cycle 11: 6-7-5-6
- Cycle 12: 6-1-9-6
- Cycle 13: 6-1-0-6
- Cycle 14: 6-1-0-1
- Cycle 15: 9-2-4-9
- Cycle 16: 9-2-8-9
- Cycle 17: 9-3-4-9
- Cycle 18: 9-3-1-9
- Cycle 19: 9-1-0-9
- Cycle 20: 4-7-3-4
- Cycle 21: 4-7-5-4
- Cycle 22: 4-8-2-4
- Cycle 23: 4-8-0-4
- Cycle 24: 7-3-5-7
- Cycle 25: 8-0-1-8

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6-9-2-6, (6, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6-9-3-6, (6, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6-9-1-6, (6, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6-9-7-6, (6, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6-2-4-7, (2, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6-2-8-0, (2, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6-7-4-6, (6, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6-7-3-6, (6, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <6-7-5-6, (6, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <6-1-9-6, (1, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <6-1-0-1, (1, 0)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <9-2-4-9, (2, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <9-2-8-9, (2, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <9-3-1-9, (3, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <4-7-3-4, (4, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <4-7-5-4, (4, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <4-8-2-4, (4, 2)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [17]
