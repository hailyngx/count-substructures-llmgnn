Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 11) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 3) (2, 1) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:  
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 14, 0, 7, 4, 13, 5)
- Cycle 2: (7, 0, 14, 6, 9, 4, 7)
- Cycle 3: (6, 1, 14, 3, 4, 6)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 0, 14, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 5: (13, 4, 11, 3, 14, 6, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (6, 13)
- Cycle 2 has chord (0, 9)
- Cycle 3 has chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 4 has chord (0, 7)
- Cycle 5 does not have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles in this graph, so the final answer is [4].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles: 
- <1, (6, 13), 5>
- <2, (0, 9), 7>
- <3, (1, 6), 14>
- <4, (0, 7), 5>
