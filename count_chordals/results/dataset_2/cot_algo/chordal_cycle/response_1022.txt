Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (18, 19) (18, 7) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 12) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 14) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 10) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 17) (3, 4) (3, 14) (17, 8) (17, 5) (17, 19) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  

There are several cycles in the graph, but we'll focus on cycles of length 4 first:  
1. (8, 1, 9, 12, 8)  
2. (8, 4, 2, 11, 8)  
3. (8, 4, 3, 14, 8)  
4. (8, 1, 9, 15, 8)  
5. (13, 11, 2, 4, 13)  
6. (13, 11, 0, 5, 13)  
7. (13, 19, 18, 7, 13)  
8. (13, 19, 17, 8, 13)  
9. (2, 14, 15, 9, 2)  
10. (2, 4, 3, 14, 2)  
11. (18, 19, 17, 8, 18)  
12. (5, 0, 11, 13, 5)  
13. (5, 17, 19, 18, 5)  
14. (6, 10, 14, 2, 6)  
15. (6, 10, 16, 7, 6)  
16. (4, 8, 17, 5, 4)  
17. (4, 2, 11, 13, 4)  
18. (4, 3, 14, 2, 4)  
19. (7, 18, 19, 13, 7)  
20. (7, 16, 10, 6, 7)  
21. (12, 9, 15, 14, 12)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  

Out of the cycles listed above, the following cycle has exactly one chord:  

<1, (9, 12), 8>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  

The final count of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
