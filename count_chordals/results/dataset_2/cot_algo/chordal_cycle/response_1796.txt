Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-8-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-7-8-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-6-4-0
- Cycle 4: 1-6-4-6-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-13-9-1
- Cycle 6: 1-11-10-2-1
- Cycle 7: 2-5-8-7-2
- Cycle 8: 2-10-3-12-2
- Cycle 9: 2-12-14-9-2
- Cycle 10: 3-5-9-14-3
- Cycle 11: 4-6-13-0-4
- Cycle 12: 5-8-13-0-5
- Cycle 13: 6-13-0-7-6
- Cycle 14: 8-11-14-9-8
- Cycle 15: 9-12-14-11-9

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are: 
- Chordal 4-Cycle 1: <1, (14, 12), 2, 4, 9>

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].
