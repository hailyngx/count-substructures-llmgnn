Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 4, 6, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 4, 2, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 2, 7, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 6, 3, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 6, 0, 4)
- Cycle 10: (7, 3, 6, 7)
- Cycle 11: (7, 3, 0, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 3, 8, 7)
- Cycle 13: (1, 8, 3, 1)
- Cycle 14: (1, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 15: (2, 1, 8, 2)
- Cycle 16: (2, 1, 6, 2)
- Cycle 17: (3, 8, 0, 3)
- Cycle 18: (8, 0, 7, 8)
- Cycle 19: (8, 0, 4, 8)
- Cycle 20: (0, 7, 3, 0)
- Cycle 21: (6, 1, 8, 6)
- Cycle 22: (6, 1, 4, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (2, 5), 8>
- <3, (7, 9), 0>
- <4, (9, 2), 4>
- <6, (4, 9), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]
