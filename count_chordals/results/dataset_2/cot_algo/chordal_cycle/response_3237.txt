Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the given graph. We will list them below:
- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 12, 11, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 1, 8, 12, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 1, 14, 5, 10, 4, 11, 0)
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 12, 11, 7, 3, 9, 2, 0, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 8, 5, 10, 4, 13, 7, 11, 12, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 14, 5, 10, 4, 13, 7, 2, 9, 0, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 9, 10, 5, 8, 1, 6, 0, 11, 12, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 9, 10, 4, 13, 7, 11, 0, 6, 1, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 12, 8, 1, 6, 0, 11, 7, 3, 9, 2)
- Cycle 10: (3, 9, 10, 5, 8, 12, 11, 7, 13, 4, 3)
- Cycle 11: (4, 10, 5, 8, 12, 11, 7, 13, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 10, 5, 14, 1, 6, 0, 11, 7, 13)
- Cycle 13: (5, 8, 12, 11, 7, 13, 4, 10, 5)
- Cycle 14: (5, 8, 1, 6, 0, 11, 12, 13, 4, 5)
- Cycle 15: (5, 10, 4, 13, 7, 11, 0, 6, 1, 8, 5)
- Cycle 16: (5, 14, 1, 8, 12, 11, 7, 13, 4, 10, 5)
- Cycle 17: (7, 11, 0, 6, 1, 8, 12, 13, 4, 10, 7)
- Cycle 18: (7, 11, 0, 6, 1, 14, 5, 10, 4, 13, 7)
- Cycle 19: (7, 11, 12, 8, 1, 14, 5, 10, 4, 13, 7)
- Cycle 20: (9, 2, 0, 6, 1, 8, 12, 11, 7, 3, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

From the cycles listed above, we can identify the following unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <0, (1, 6), 12, 11>
- <1, (8, 5), 10, 4>
- <1, (14, 5), 10, 4>
- <2, (9, 10), 5, 8>
- <2, (12, 8), 1, 6>
- <3, (9, 10), 5, 8>
- <7, (11, 0), 6, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
