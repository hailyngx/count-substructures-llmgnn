Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 0) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 23) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 8) (27, 15) (27, 11) (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 24) (3, 21) (3, 16) (3, 9) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (17, 1) (17, 8) (25, 7) (25, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 22) (20, 29) (20, 19) (20, 6) (20, 10) (18, 19) (18, 28) (19, 29) (19, 20) (19, 18) (19, 22) (6, 7) (6, 20) (6, 24) (6, 2) (24, 7) (24, 6) (22, 29) (22, 19) (22, 12) (22, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 28) (23, 21) (23, 15) (23, 4) (12, 5) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 26) (10, 20) (10, 28) (14, 5) (14, 12) (0, 1) (0, 25) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 26) (11, 27) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 26) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 8) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 22) (8, 16) (28, 18) (28, 2) (28, 10) (26, 12) (26, 4) (26, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 17, 8, 15, 27, 11, 13, 2, 6, 7, 21, 3, 9, 0, 25, 7)
- Cycle 2: (5, 12, 22, 19, 29, 20, 6, 2, 13, 11, 9, 3, 21, 7, 25)
- Cycle 3: (18, 19, 22, 12, 5, 14, 12, 26, 4, 0, 9, 3, 21, 7, 24, 6)
- Cycle 4: (18, 19, 29, 22, 12, 5, 14, 12, 26, 4, 16, 8, 17, 1, 0, 25)
- Cycle 5: (18, 19, 29, 22, 12, 26, 11, 13, 2, 28, 10, 20, 6, 24, 7, 25)
- Cycle 6: (18, 28, 10, 20, 19, 29, 22, 12, 5, 14, 12, 26, 11, 13, 2, 6)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has a chord <5, 14>.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has a chord <29, 20>.
- Cycle 5 has a chord <2, 28>.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<5, 14, (12, 22), 19, 29>
<2, 28, (13, 11), 26, 12>
<29, 20, (22, 19), 18, 28>
