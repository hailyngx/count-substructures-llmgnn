Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (2, 4, 8, 15, 2)
- Cycle 2: (2, 4, 13, 6, 3, 2)
- Cycle 3: (2, 14, 29, 19, 8, 4, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 6, 9, 22, 7, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 6, 13, 27, 12, 18, 11, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 10, 20, 15, 8, 4, 13, 3)
- Cycle 7: (5, 17, 27, 12, 18, 21, 26, 0, 5)
- Cycle 8: (6, 10, 20, 24, 8, 15, 2, 6)
- Cycle 9: (7, 1, 22, 9, 6, 3, 10, 7)
- Cycle 10: (7, 22, 18, 12, 27, 16, 1, 7)
- Cycle 11: (8, 4, 13, 27, 16, 1, 28, 25, 8)
- Cycle 12: (11, 18, 21, 26, 0, 23, 19, 29, 14, 11)
- Cycle 13: (12, 18, 21, 5, 17, 27, 16, 8, 19, 11)
- Cycle 14: (13, 6, 9, 18, 12, 27, 16, 1, 7, 22, 13)
- Cycle 15: (14, 2, 15, 8, 4, 13, 27, 12, 18, 11, 29, 14)
- Cycle 16: (15, 2, 29, 14, 19, 23, 0, 26, 21, 5, 27, 16, 15)
- Cycle 17: (16, 1, 7, 22, 9, 6, 13, 27, 12, 18, 21, 26, 0, 23, 19, 29, 14, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (2, 15)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (6, 2)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 5 has no chords
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (10, 3)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (21, 5)
- Cycle 8 has no chords
- Cycle 9 has no chords
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (18, 7)
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (8, 16)
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: (18, 26)
- Cycle 13 has 1 chord: (12, 16)
- Cycle 14 has 1 chord: (18, 14)
- Cycle 15 has 1 chord: (2, 18)
- Cycle 16 has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 8 chordal 4-cycles in the graph: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (2, 15), 8, 4>
- <3, (6, 2), 13, 27>
- <6, (4, 8), 15, 2>
- <9, (9, 3), 22, 7>
- <12, (18, 7), 21, 26>
- <18, (8, 16), 27, 11>
- <18, (12, 16), 27, 13>
- <18, (14, 18), 27, 12>
