Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 0) (7, 9) (7, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (2, 4) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 15) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 5) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (19, 6) (19, 8) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 17) (15, 2) (15, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-13-10-11-6-9-12-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-12-10-11-6-9-7-0-14-16-17-5-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-2-15-18-9-12-10-13-1
- Cycle 4: 1-5-17-16-14-0-7-9-12-4-1
- Cycle 5: 1-5-17-16-9-12-10-13-3-1
- Cycle 6: 3-13-10-11-6-9-12-4-2-3
- Cycle 7: 3-1-4-12-10-13-3
- Cycle 8: 3-17-16-14-0-7-9-12-4-2-3
- Cycle 9: 3-17-16-9-18-15-2-4-12-10-13-3
- Cycle 10: 5-17-16-14-0-7-9-12-4-1-5
- Cycle 11: 5-17-16-9-18-15-2-4-1-5

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle: <1, (12, 10), 13)>
- Cycle 2 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 3 is a chordal 4-cycle: <1, (2, 15), 18)>
- Cycle 4 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle: <1, (12, 10), 13)>
- Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle: <3, (4, 12), 13)>
- Cycle 7 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle: <3, (16, 14), 17)>
- Cycle 9 is a chordal 4-cycle: <3, (16, 14), 17)>
- Cycle 10 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 11 is not a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [4]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (12, 10), 13)>
- <1, (2, 15), 18)>
- <3, (4, 12), 13)>
- <3, (16, 14), 17)>
