Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-9-2-1
- Cycle 2: 3-9-8-4-3
- Cycle 3: 4-5-0-2-4
- Cycle 4: 8-2-0-5-8
- Cycle 5: 6-1-3-5-6
- Cycle 6: 7-1-9-3-7
- Cycle 7: 9-0-8-6-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <1, (9, 2), 3>
- <3, (8, 9), 4>
- <4, (0, 5), 8>
- <8, (0, 5), 2>
- <6, (3, 5), 1>
- <7, (1, 9), 3>
- <9, (8, 6), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [7].
