Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 8) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 10) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 18) (6, 13) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 18) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 2) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 4) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 19) (5, 17) (1, 18) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 8) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <8, 11, 10, 16>
- <8, 11, 18, 17>
- <8, 7, 14, 17>
- <8, 7, 4, 19>
- <8, 16, 10, 2>
- <8, 19, 4, 0>
- <11, 18, 17, 0>
- <11, 18, 15, 3>
- <11, 10, 16, 2>
- <16, 10, 11, 18>
- <16, 10, 2, 8>
- <16, 8, 7, 14>
- <16, 8, 19, 4>
- <16, 9, 13, 14>
- <16, 9, 19, 15>
- <3, 15, 18, 17>
- <15, 18, 11, 10>
- <15, 18, 17, 0>
- <15, 19, 9, 13>
- <15, 19, 8, 2>
- <6, 13, 9, 16>
- <14, 17, 0, 12>
- <14, 17, 18, 15>
- <14, 13, 9, 16>
- <14, 13, 0, 17>
- <17, 0, 4, 7>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycle is <8, 11, 10, 16>, which has a chord 10-16.

Step 3:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, so the final answer is [1].
