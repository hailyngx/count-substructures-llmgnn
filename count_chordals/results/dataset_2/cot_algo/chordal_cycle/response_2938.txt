Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  

- Cycle 1: 1-6-3-7-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-2-5-1
- Cycle 3: 1-9-4-8-1
- Cycle 4: 3-6-2-5-3
- Cycle 5: 3-1-7-8-3
- Cycle 6: 4-9-8-7-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 

Out of the above cycles, only Cycle 6 has exactly one chord, which is the edge (9, 7). 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  

The total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <1, 4, 8, 9>
