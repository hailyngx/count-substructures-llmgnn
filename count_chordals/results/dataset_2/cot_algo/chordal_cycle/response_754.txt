Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (10, 7) (10, 3) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 13, 14, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 12, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 0, 5)
- Cycle 5: (13, 14, 11, 13)
- Cycle 6: (13, 2, 0, 13)
- Cycle 7: (13, 2, 11, 13)
- Cycle 8: (13, 5, 6, 13)
- Cycle 9: (13, 5, 3, 13)
- Cycle 10: (13, 6, 2, 13)
- Cycle 11: (4, 9, 14, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 7, 0, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 7, 13, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 12, 8, 4)
- Cycle 15: (7, 0, 3, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 10, 3, 7)
- Cycle 17: (7, 10, 3, 7)
- Cycle 18: (7, 1, 11, 7)
- Cycle 19: (8, 12, 0, 8)
- Cycle 20: (8, 11, 1, 8)
- Cycle 21: (14, 9, 4, 14)
- Cycle 22: (14, 11, 1, 14)
- Cycle 23: (12, 0, 2, 12)


Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 

- The cycle <5, 8, 12, 5> has a chord (8, 12).
- The cycle <13, 5, 6, 13> has a chord (5, 6).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
