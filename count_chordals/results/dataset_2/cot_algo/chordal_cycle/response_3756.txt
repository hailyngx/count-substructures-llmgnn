Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 8) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (4, 9, 14, 13, 4)
- Cycle 2: (7, 12, 0, 14, 10, 7)
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 4, 7, 10, 6)
- Cycle 4: (2, 12, 7, 10, 14, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 13, 0, 12, 7, 2)
- Cycle 6: (8, 2, 13, 14, 0, 12, 8)
- Cycle 7: (1, 9, 4, 13, 0, 14, 1)
- Cycle 8: (5, 6, 9, 14, 1, 5)
- Cycle 9: (3, 8, 2, 6, 5, 1, 14, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (12, 14)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (4, 10)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (2, 7)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (12, 0)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (2, 14)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (6, 14)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (8, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [9].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (9, 13), 4, 14>
<2, (12, 14), 7, 10>
<3, (4, 10), 6, 9>
<4, (2, 7), 12, 10>
<5, (12, 0), 7, 13>
<6, (2, 14), 0, 13>
<7, (9, 13), 4, 0>
<8, (6, 14), 5, 9>
<9, (8, 1), 2, 5>
