Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-0-8-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-1-8-6
- Cycle 3: 6-5-1-8-6
- Cycle 4: 6-3-7-8-6
- Cycle 5: 6-1-4-7-6
- Cycle 6: 4-7-8-0-4
- Cycle 7: 4-7-3-2-4
- Cycle 8: 4-1-5-6-4
- Cycle 9: 7-8-0-6-7
- Cycle 10: 7-3-2-4-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (9, 1)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (3, 7)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (7, 2)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (0, 6)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (3, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <6, (9, 8), 0, 8, 6>
- <6, (9, 1), 1, 8, 6>
- <6, (5, 8), 1, 8, 6>
- <6, (3, 7), 7, 8, 6>
- <6, (1, 7), 5, 4, 6>
- <4, (7, 8), 0, 6, 4>
- <4, (7, 2), 3, 2, 4>
- <4, (1, 5), 6, 4, 1>
- <7, (8, 0), 6, 7, 0>
- <7, (3, 2), 4, 7, 3>
