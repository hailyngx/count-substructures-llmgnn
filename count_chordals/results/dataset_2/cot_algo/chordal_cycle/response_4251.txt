Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 4 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 9 - 7 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 1 - 7 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 5: 6 - 3 - 8 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 6: 6 - 0 - 2 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 7: 6 - 4 - 9 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 8: 1 - 7 - 9 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 9: 3 - 8 - 0 - 2 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <5, 9, 1, 5> has a chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 2 <5, 9, 4, 6, 5> has a chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 3 <5, 9, 7, 1, 5> has a chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 4 <5, 1, 7, 9, 5> has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 5 <6, 3, 8, 2, 6> has a chord (3, 8)
- Cycle 6 <6, 0, 2, 8, 6> has a chord (0, 8)
- Cycle 7 <6, 4, 9, 5, 6> has a chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 8 <1, 7, 9, 4, 1> has a chord (7, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, 9, 1, (9, 1)>
<5, 9, 4, 6, (9, 6)>
<5, 9, 7, 1, (9, 7)>
<5, 1, 7, 9, (1, 9)>
