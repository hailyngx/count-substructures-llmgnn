Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<3, 1, 9, 2>
<5, 4, 8, 0>
<5, 4, 0, 8>
<3, 1, 7, 0>
<3, 1, 7, 6>
<3, 5, 8, 1>
<3, 5, 8, 4>
<4, 2, 9, 7>
<4, 2, 7, 0>
<6, 3, 1, 7>
<6, 3, 5, 8>
<7, 0, 4, 8>
<7, 0, 8, 5>
<7, 1, 9, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<3, 1, 9, 2> (Chord: (1, 9))
<5, 4, 8, 0> (Chord: (4, 8))
<3, 1, 7, 0> (Chord: (1, 7))
<4, 2, 9, 7> (Chord: (2, 9))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
