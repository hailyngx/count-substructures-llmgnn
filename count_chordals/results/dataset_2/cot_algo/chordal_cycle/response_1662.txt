Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 16) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (15, 2) (15, 14) (15, 19) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 18) (4, 9) (4, 3) (18, 19) (18, 11) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 6) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 10 - 5
- Cycle 2: 2 - 8 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 3: 13 - 8 - 6 - 13
- Cycle 4: 7 - 12 - 13 - 7
- Cycle 5: 14 - 0 - 15 - 14
- Cycle 6: 17 - 13 - 7 - 17
- Cycle 7: 19 - 8 - 6 - 19
- Cycle 8: 4 - 9 - 10 - 4
- Cycle 9: 18 - 19 - 8 - 18
- Cycle 10: 1 - 7 - 12 - 1
- Cycle 11: 16 - 9 - 10 - 16
- Cycle 12: 3 - 6 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 13: 11 - 13 - 7 - 11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Among the listed cycles, Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 10 - 5 is the only cycle with exactly one chord, (5, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, (5, 10), 9>.
