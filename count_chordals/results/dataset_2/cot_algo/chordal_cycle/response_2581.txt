Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 13) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 4) (10, 8) (10, 19) (17, 9) (17, 5) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 16) (0, 19) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 12) (8, 10) (8, 9) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 7) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 19) (7, 14) (7, 9) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 14) (16, 18) (16, 14) (16, 13) (16, 19) (12, 1) (12, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. 
- One such cycle is <2, 5, 17, 9>. 

Step 2:
- The cycle <2, 5, 17, 9> has exactly one chord, the edge (5, 17). Therefore, it is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
- There is one unique chordal 4-cycle found, which is <2, 5, 17, 9>.
- The number of chordless cycles found is 0, so the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
