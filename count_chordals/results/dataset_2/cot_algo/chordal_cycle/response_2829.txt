Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 0-1-5-2-0
2. Cycle 0-1-4-3-0
3. Cycle 0-8-5-2-0
4. Cycle 0-8-7-3-0
5. Cycle 0-9-7-3-0
6. Cycle 1-5-2-6-1
7. Cycle 1-5-2-4-1
8. Cycle 1-9-7-3-1
9. Cycle 1-9-7-5-1
10. Cycle 2-6-7-5-2
11. Cycle 3-4-2-6-3
12. Cycle 3-4-2-5-3
13. Cycle 3-7-8-6-3
14. Cycle 5-7-8-6-5

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 0-1-5-2-0 has chord (1, 2)
2. Cycle 0-1-4-3-0 has chord (1, 3)
3. Cycle 1-5-2-6-1 has chord (5, 2)
4. Cycle 1-9-7-3-1 has chord (9, 7)
5. Cycle 2-6-7-5-2 has chord (6, 5)
6. Cycle 3-7-8-6-3 has chord (7, 6)

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <0, (1, 2), 5>
2. <0, (1, 3), 4>
3. <1, (5, 2), 6>
4. <1, (7, 9), 3>
5. <2, (6, 5), 7>
6. <3, (7, 6), 8>
