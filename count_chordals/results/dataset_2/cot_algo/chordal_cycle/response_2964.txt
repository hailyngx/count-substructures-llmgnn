Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-6-4-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-8-3-5
- Cycle 3: 5-3-4-6-5
- Cycle 4: 5-3-8-1-5

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (3, 6)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (3, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<1, (1, 4)>
<2, (1, 8)>
<3, (3, 6)>
<4, (3, 8)>
