Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Possible cycles of length 4 or more are: 
- Cycle 1: 1-6-3-5-2-7-4-9-1 
- Cycle 2: 0-14-13-5-3-6-1-11-0 
- Cycle 3: 7-8-11-12-2-5-3-6-7 
- Cycle 4: 9-13-5-7-8-11-12-4-9 
- Cycle 5: 10-6-3-5-13-9-4-12-10 
- Cycle 6: 2-12-6-3-5-13-9-14-2 

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (6, 3), 5, 2, 7, 4, 9, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (14, 13), 5, 3, 6, 1, 11, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <7, (8, 11), 12, 2, 5, 3, 6, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (13, 5), 7, 8, 11, 12, 4, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <10, (6, 3), 5, 13, 9, 4, 12, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <2, (12, 6), 3, 5, 13, 9, 14, 2>

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [6].
