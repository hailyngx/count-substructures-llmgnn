Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle: 5-9-6-8-5
2. Cycle: 9-6-4-1-9
3. Cycle: 6-4-1-0-6
4. Cycle: 4-1-7-2-4
5. Cycle: 8-7-2-0-8

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 5-9-6-8-5 has a chord (6, 8) forming a chordal 4-cycle <5, (6, 8), 9>.
2. Cycle 9-6-4-1-9 has a chord (4, 1) forming a chordal 4-cycle <9, (4, 1), 6>.
3. Cycle 6-4-1-0-6 has a chord (1, 0) forming a chordal 4-cycle <6, (1, 0), 4>.
4. Cycle 4-1-7-2-4 has a chord (1, 7) forming a chordal 4-cycle <4, (1, 7), 2>.
5. Cycle 8-7-2-0-8 has a chord (2, 0) forming a chordal 4-cycle <8, (2, 0), 7>.

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the answer is [5].
