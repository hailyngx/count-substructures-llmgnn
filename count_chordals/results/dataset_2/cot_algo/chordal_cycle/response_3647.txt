Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-9-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-9-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-9-1
- Cycle 4: 3-9-2-3
- Cycle 5: 3-4-6-3
- Cycle 6: 4-8-6-4
- Cycle 7: 4-0-6-4
- Cycle 8: 4-8-2-4
- Cycle 9: 4-3-9-4
- Cycle 10: 7-9-1-7

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (6, 9), 3>
- <3, (9, 2), 4>
- <4, (6, 8), 0>
- <4, (0, 5), 8>
- <7, (1, 9), 3>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [5].
