Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 14) (15, 18) (15, 8) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 0) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 19) (1, 17) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 16) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 11) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 7, 4, 2, 6)
- Cycle 2: (3, 7, 5, 19, 14)
- Cycle 3: (15, 18, 10, 2, 6, 12, 9, 8)
- Cycle 4: (15, 18, 5, 19, 13, 0, 4, 7)
- Cycle 5: (15, 8, 9, 12, 6, 2, 4, 0)
- Cycle 6: (9, 8, 13, 19, 5, 7, 14, 11)
- Cycle 7: (9, 12, 19, 5, 18, 15, 8, 11)
- Cycle 8: (4, 7, 14, 11, 9, 12, 16, 0)
- Cycle 9: (7, 3, 14, 19, 12, 6, 2, 4)
- Cycle 10: (8, 15, 18, 10, 2, 4, 0, 13)
- Cycle 11: (8, 9, 12, 6, 2, 10, 18, 15)
- Cycle 12: (13, 8, 9, 12, 16, 0, 4, 7)
- Cycle 13: (13, 19, 12, 6, 2, 4, 0, 16)
- Cycle 14: (10, 18, 5, 19, 14, 11, 9, 12)
- Cycle 15: (17, 1, 19, 5, 7, 3, 14, 11)
- Cycle 16: (17, 19, 13, 0, 4, 2, 6, 12)
- Cycle 17: (1, 17, 19, 12, 6, 2, 4, 0)
- Cycle 18: (5, 7, 14, 11, 9, 8, 15, 18)
- Cycle 19: (0, 4, 7, 14, 11, 9, 12, 16)
- Cycle 20: (16, 0, 13, 19, 5, 18, 15, 8)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 10), 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (4, 16), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (5, 19), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (0, 16), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (7, 9), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (8, 12), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <13, (9, 19), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <15, (8, 18), 10>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 12 chordless 4-cycles, so the final answer is [12].
