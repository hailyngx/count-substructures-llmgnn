Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
(0, 9, 4, 6)
(0, 9, 4, 2)
(0, 9, 5, 2)
(0, 9, 5, 8)
(0, 4, 2, 5)
(0, 4, 2, 8)
(0, 4, 6, 8)
(0, 4, 6, 1)
(0, 4, 9, 5)
(0, 4, 9, 3)
(0, 2, 5, 8)
(0, 3, 9, 5)
(1, 9, 4, 6)
(1, 4, 6, 8)
(1, 4, 6, 2)
(1, 4, 2, 5)
(1, 7, 3, 9)
(1, 7, 3, 0)
(2, 5, 9, 4)
(2, 5, 9, 3)
(2, 5, 8, 6)
(3, 5, 2, 0)
(3, 5, 9, 4)
(3, 5, 9, 0)

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
The cycle (0, 4, 2, 5) has exactly one chord: (0, 5).
The cycle (0, 4, 2, 8) has exactly one chord: (0, 8).
The cycle (0, 4, 6, 8) has exactly one chord: (4, 8).
The cycle (0, 4, 6, 1) has exactly one chord: (4, 1).
The cycle (1, 9, 4, 6) has exactly one chord: (9, 6).
The cycle (1, 4, 6, 8) has exactly one chord: (4, 8).
The cycle (1, 4, 6, 2) has exactly one chord: (4, 2).
The cycle (1, 7, 3, 9) has exactly one chord: (7, 9).
The cycle (1, 7, 3, 0) has exactly one chord: (7, 0).
The cycle (2, 5, 9, 4) has exactly one chord: (2, 9).
The cycle (2, 5, 9, 3) has exactly one chord: (2, 3).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
[10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 4, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 6, 8>
<0, 4, 6, 1>
<1, 9, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 6, 8>
<1, 4, 6, 2>
<1, 7, 3, 9>
<1, 7, 3, 0>
<2, 5, 9, 4>
<2, 5, 9, 3>
