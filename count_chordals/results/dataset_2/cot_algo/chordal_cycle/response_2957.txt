Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 19) (2, 9) (8, 19) (4, 18) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 1) (0, 7) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 16) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 6) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 12) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 1) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 9) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 16) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 16) (10, 14) (10, 3) (6, 4) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) 

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
1. Cycle: (14, 17, 13, 5, 7, 12)
2. Cycle: (14, 3, 9, 2)
3. Cycle: (14, 3, 11, 4, 18, 6)
4. Cycle: (14, 3, 19, 12, 7, 0)
5. Cycle: (14, 10, 3, 9, 16, 1, 18, 4)
6. Cycle: (17, 13, 15, 6, 4, 11)
7. Cycle: (17, 13, 5, 16, 9, 3, 10)
8. Cycle: (7, 0, 5, 13, 17)
9. Cycle: (7, 5, 16, 1, 18, 4)
10. Cycle: (7, 12, 19, 8)
11. Cycle: (12, 19, 1, 18, 4, 15)
12. Cycle: (2, 9, 16, 1)
13. Cycle: (4, 18, 1, 16, 9, 3, 10)
14. Cycle: (4, 11, 19, 1, 18)
15. Cycle: (4, 6, 13, 17, 14)
16. Cycle: (4, 15, 13, 17, 14)
17. Cycle: (18, 6, 13, 5, 7, 0)
18. Cycle: (18, 1, 16, 9, 3)
19. Cycle: (0, 7, 12, 19, 8)
20. Cycle: (5, 13, 15, 6)
21. Cycle: (5, 16, 1, 18)
22. Cycle: (13, 15, 4, 11)

Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <14, 17, 13, 5, 7, 12> has one chord (7, 13).
- The cycle <14, 3, 9, 2> has one chord (3, 9).
- The cycle <14, 3, 11, 4, 18, 6> has one chord (3, 18).
- The cycle <14, 3, 19, 12, 7, 0> has one chord (3, 7).
- The cycle <17, 13, 15, 6, 4, 11> has one chord (13, 4).
- The cycle <7, 5, 16, 1, 18, 4> has one chord (5, 18).
- The cycle <12, 19, 1, 18, 4, 15> has one chord (19, 4).
- The cycle <2, 9, 16, 1> has one chord (9, 16).
- The cycle <4, 18, 1, 16, 9, 3, 10> has one chord (18, 9).
- The cycle <0, 7, 12, 19, 8> has one chord (7, 19).
- The cycle <5, 16, 1, 18> has one chord (16, 18).
- The cycle <13, 15, 4, 11> has one chord (15, 4).

Finally, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
