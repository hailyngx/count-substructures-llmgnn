Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 4) (6, 15) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 7) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 0) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 12) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 18) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 10) (18, 16) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (2, 17) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 17) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 8) (1, 19) (1, 14) (13, 12) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (0, 4, 15, 16, 0)
- (0, 4, 15, 16, 17, 2, 0)
- (0, 4, 10, 8, 5, 0)
- (0, 4, 10, 8, 17, 2, 0)
- (0, 16, 15, 4, 0)
- (0, 16, 15, 4, 10, 0)
- (0, 16, 17, 2, 0)
- (0, 16, 17, 2, 10, 0)
- (0, 5, 8, 17, 2, 0)
- (4, 0, 5, 8, 10, 4)
- (4, 0, 16, 17, 2, 4)
- (8, 3, 7, 9, 8)
- (8, 5, 0, 4, 8)
- (8, 5, 0, 10, 8)
- (8, 5, 0, 16, 8)
- (8, 7, 9, 14, 8)
- (9, 6, 15, 16, 9)
- (9, 6, 15, 4, 9)
- (9, 6, 15, 16, 17, 9)
- (9, 6, 15, 4, 10, 9)
- (9, 6, 9, 7, 9)
- (9, 7, 14, 1, 9)
- (9, 7, 14, 1, 19, 11, 9)
- (9, 7, 14, 1, 19, 5, 9)
- (9, 7, 8, 3, 9)
- (10, 0, 4, 15, 10)
- (10, 0, 16, 15, 4, 10)
- (10, 4, 15, 16, 10)
- (10, 4, 15, 16, 17, 10)
- (10, 4, 0, 5, 10)
- (10, 8, 5, 0, 10)
- (10, 8, 17, 2, 10)
- (10, 8, 5, 0, 16, 10)
- (11, 3, 8, 5, 11)
- (11, 3, 8, 10, 11)
- (11, 19, 1, 14, 11)
- (12, 16, 17, 2, 12)
- (12, 16, 17, 8, 3, 12)
- (12, 13, 1, 14, 12)
- (12, 13, 1, 19, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal cycle <0, (4, 15), 16, (17, 2), 0>
- Chordal cycle <0, (4, 10), 8, (5, 16), 0>
- Chordal cycle <0, (4, 15), 16, (17, 2), 10, 0>
- Chordal cycle <0, (4, 10), 8, (5, 16), 17, 2, 0>
- Chordal cycle <4, (0, 5), 8, (10, 6), 4>
- Chordal cycle <4, (0, 16), 15, (4, 10), 8>
- Chordal cycle <9, (6, 15), 16, (17, 10), 9>
- Chordal cycle <9, (6, 15), 4, (10, 14), 9>
- Chordal cycle <9, (6, 15), 16, (17, 2), 9>
- Chordal cycle <9, (7, 14), 1, (19, 11), 9>
- Chordal cycle <9, (7, 8), 3, (11, 5), 9>
- Chordal cycle <10, (0, 16), 15, (4, 10), 8>
- Chordal cycle <10, (4, 15), 16, (17, 10), 8>
- Chordal cycle <10, (4, 0), 5, (8, 16), 10>
- Chordal cycle <10, (4, 0), 16, (17, 2), 10>
- Chordal cycle <10, (4, 15), 16, (17, 2), 10>
- Chordal cycle <11, (3, 8), 5, (11, 19), 14>
- Chordal cycle <12, (16, 17), 2, (8, 3), 12>
- Chordal cycle <12, (16, 17), 8, (3, 14), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 19 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [19].
