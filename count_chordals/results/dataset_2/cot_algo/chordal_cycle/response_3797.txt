Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 21) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 29) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (20, 1) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 18) (25, 20) (25, 15) (18, 22) (18, 20) (18, 8) (4, 8) (4, 27) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 4) (7, 11) (7, 20) (7, 12) (7, 27) (12, 7) (12, 15) (17, 11) (17, 29) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 6) (29, 26) (26, 29) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 24) (24, 26) (24, 28) (24, 21) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 28) (27, 21) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 5) (23, 10) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 6) (15, 25) (15, 12) (6, 29) (6, 23) (21, 22) (21, 24) (21, 27) (21, 14) (0, 10) (0, 26) (14, 26) (14, 23) (14, 21) (14, 16) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 9) (9, 2) (16, 3) (16, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 29, 17, 11, 10, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 29, 17, 11, 7, 20, 18)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 29, 17, 11, 23, 6, 29)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 29, 17, 11, 23, 14, 26)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 29, 26, 24, 21, 22, 18)
- Cycle 6: (1, 3, 29, 26, 24, 21, 27, 4)
- Cycle 7: (1, 3, 29, 26, 24, 21, 14, 26)
- Cycle 8: (1, 3, 29, 6, 23, 11, 17, 29)
- Cycle 9: (1, 3, 29, 6, 23, 14, 26, 24)
- Cycle 10: (1, 3, 29, 6, 23, 14, 21, 24)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <(1, 3, 29, 17, 11, 7, 20, 18)>
- <(1, 3, 29, 26, 24, 21, 22, 18)>
- <(1, 3, 29, 26, 24, 21, 27, 4)>
- <(1, 3, 29, 26, 24, 21, 14, 26)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
