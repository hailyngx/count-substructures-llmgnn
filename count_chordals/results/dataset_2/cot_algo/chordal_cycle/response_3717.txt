Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 14) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more
- Cycle 1: 0-1-6-10-12-8-3-5-14-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-10-12-8-3-5-14-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-0-4-13-7-12-8-3-5-14-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-0-4-13-7-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-0-4-13-1
- Cycle 6: 1-6-10-12-9-14-1
- Cycle 7: 3-8-11-9-14-1
- Cycle 8: 3-8-12-7-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord
- Cycle 1: [Chordless]
- Cycle 2: [Chordless]
- Cycle 3: <1, (12, 3), 5> 
- Cycle 4: [Chordless]
- Cycle 5: [Chordless]
- Cycle 6: [Chordless]
- Cycle 7: [Chordless]
- Cycle 8: <3, (7, 12), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found
- Total chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are <1, (12, 3), 5> and <3, (7, 12), 1>.
