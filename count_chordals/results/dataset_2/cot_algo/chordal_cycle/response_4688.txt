Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: (4, 7, 1, 4)
2. Cycle 2: (4, 6, 1, 4)
3. Cycle 3: (4, 1, 7, 4)
4. Cycle 4: (4, 1, 6, 4)
5. Cycle 5: (7, 6, 9, 7)
6. Cycle 6: (7, 9, 1, 7)
7. Cycle 7: (7, 1, 6, 7)
8. Cycle 8: (6, 9, 1, 6)
9. Cycle 9: (6, 1, 4, 6)
10. Cycle 10: (9, 1, 4, 9)
11. Cycle 11: (1, 3, 4, 1)
12. Cycle 12: (3, 8, 4, 3)
13. Cycle 13: (8, 0, 6, 8)
14. Cycle 14: (2, 9, 6, 2)
15. Cycle 15: (0, 2, 9, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

1. <1, (4, 7), 6>
2. <2, (4, 6), 1>
3. <3, (4, 1), 7>
4. <4, (4, 1), 6>
5. <5, (7, 9), 6>
6. <6, (7, 1), 9>
7. <7, (6, 1), 7>
8. <8, (6, 9), 1>
9. <9, (6, 1), 4>
10. <10, (9, 1), 4>
11. <11, (1, 3), 4>
12. <12, (3, 8), 4>
13. <13, (8, 0), 6>
14. <14, (2, 9), 6>
15. <15, (0, 2), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [0] chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
