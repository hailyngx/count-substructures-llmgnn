Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-9-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-2-9-6-0
- Cycle 3: 0-6-3-4-0
- Cycle 4: 1-9-6-2-1
- Cycle 5: 2-9-1-7-2
- Cycle 6: 3-6-9-1-3
- Cycle 7: 4-3-6-9-4
- Cycle 8: 5-4-3-8-5
- Cycle 9: 7-1-0-6-7
- Cycle 10: 8-3-2-7-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (9, 1) which connects non-adjacent nodes 1 and 9. Chordal 4-cycle found: <<0, 2, 6, 9>, (1, 9)>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Final count of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
