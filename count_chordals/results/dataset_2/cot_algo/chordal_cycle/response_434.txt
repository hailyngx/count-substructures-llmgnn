Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1:

- <0, 6, 9, 7, 0>
- <0, 6, 9, 3, 0>
- <1, 4, 6, 0, 1>
- <1, 4, 6, 9, 1>
- <1, 4, 9, 7, 1>
- <1, 4, 9, 3, 1>
- <1, 5, 7, 3, 1>
- <1, 5, 7, 9, 1>
- <1, 5, 2, 8, 1>
- <2, 4, 6, 0, 2>
- <2, 4, 6, 9, 2>
- <2, 4, 1, 5, 2>
- <2, 4, 1, 0, 2>
- <2, 5, 7, 9, 2>
- <2, 5, 7, 3, 2>
- <2, 5, 1, 4, 2>
- <3, 7, 9, 6, 3>
- <3, 7, 5, 1, 3>
- <3, 7, 5, 2, 3>
- <3, 8, 2, 5, 3>
- <4, 6, 9, 7, 4>
- <4, 9, 7, 5, 4>

Step 2:
List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 5, 7, 3, 0> with chord (5, 7)
- <1, 4, 6, 0, 1> with chord (4, 6)
- <2, 5, 7, 9, 2> with chord (5, 9)
- <3, 7, 9, 6, 3> with chord (7, 9)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [4].
