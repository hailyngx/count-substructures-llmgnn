Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 10) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 8, 13, 2, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 8, 12, 6, 11, 5)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 7, 9, 2, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 5, 7, 11, 6, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 5, 13, 2, 7, 0)
- Cycle 6: (1, 8, 12, 6, 2, 1)
- Cycle 7: (6, 11, 14, 9, 7, 6)
- Cycle 8: (10, 3, 14, 9, 7, 10)
- Cycle 9: (10, 8, 12, 2, 13, 10)
- Cycle 10: (10, 8, 1, 0, 7, 10)
- Cycle 11: (11, 6, 2, 13, 5, 11)
- Cycle 12: (11, 6, 12, 8, 5, 11)
- Cycle 13: (11, 7, 2, 13, 5, 11)
- Cycle 14: (11, 7, 0, 1, 8, 11)
- Cycle 15: (11, 7, 9, 14, 3, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the 15 cycles listed, cycle 12: (11, 6, 12, 8, 5, 11) has exactly one chord (8, 6).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.
Therefore, the final count is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <12, (8, 6), 5>.
