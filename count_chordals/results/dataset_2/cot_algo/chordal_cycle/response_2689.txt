Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <4, 7, 18, 11>. 

Let's count the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph:

Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 18, 2, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 16, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 16, 19, 12, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 18, 2, 10, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 18, 11, 13, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 18, 10, 5, 7)
- Cycle 7: (6, 16, 19, 12, 6)
- Cycle 8: (9, 6, 16, 4, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 12, 15, 17, 9)
- Cycle 10: (8, 17, 13, 11, 8)
- Cycle 11: (8, 17, 15, 14, 8)
- Cycle 12: (13, 17, 15, 14, 13)
- Cycle 13: (2, 7, 18, 11, 2)
- Cycle 14: (2, 18, 11, 13, 2)
- Cycle 15: (2, 18, 10, 5, 2)
- Cycle 16: (18, 11, 13, 14, 18)
- Cycle 17: (18, 10, 5, 0, 18)
- Cycle 18: (18, 10, 2, 4, 18)
- Cycle 19: (1, 8, 17, 13, 1)
- Cycle 20: (1, 8, 11, 18, 1)
- Cycle 21: (15, 12, 9, 6, 15)
- Cycle 22: (15, 12, 19, 16, 15)
- Cycle 23: (15, 17, 13, 11, 15)
- Cycle 24: (17, 15, 12, 9, 17)
- Cycle 25: (17, 15, 14, 3, 17)
- Cycle 26: (17, 19, 12, 9, 17)
- Cycle 27: (16, 19, 12, 15, 16)
- Cycle 28: (16, 19, 17, 8, 16)
- Cycle 29: (12, 9, 6, 16, 12)
- Cycle 30: (12, 15, 17, 8, 12)
- Cycle 31: (11, 18, 7, 4, 11)
- Cycle 32: (11, 18, 10, 2, 11)
- Cycle 33: (14, 15, 12, 9, 14)
- Cycle 34: (14, 15, 17, 8, 14)
- Cycle 35: (14, 3, 0, 1, 14)
- Cycle 36: (0, 5, 10, 2, 0)
- Cycle 37: (3, 14, 4, 16, 3)
- Cycle 38: (19, 16, 6, 9, 19)
- Cycle 39: (10, 5, 0, 1, 10)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Only Cycle 1: (4, 7, 18, 2, 4) has exactly one chord, which is edge (18, 2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
