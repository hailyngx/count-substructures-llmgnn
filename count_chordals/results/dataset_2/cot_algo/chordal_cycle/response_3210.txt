Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 5) (7, 11) (7, 19) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 15) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 14) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 9) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 6) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 15) (15, 2) (15, 14) (18, 13) (18, 10) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <0, 16, 9, 1>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 16, 4, 12>
        - Cycle 3: <0, 19, 1, 10>
        - Cycle 4: <1, 19, 0, 16>
        - Cycle 5: <1, 10, 5, 13>
        - Cycle 6: <1, 10, 18, 13>
        - Cycle 7: <1, 9, 12, 4>
        - Cycle 8: <1, 9, 3, 12>
        - Cycle 9: <2, 8, 6, 4>
        - Cycle 10: <2, 8, 13, 5>
        - Cycle 11: <2, 15, 14, 5>
        - Cycle 12: <3, 12, 4, 6>
        - Cycle 13: <3, 12, 9, 16>
        - Cycle 14: <3, 11, 7, 19>
        - Cycle 15: <4, 12, 3, 2>
        - Cycle 16: <4, 16, 9, 13>
        - Cycle 17: <4, 6, 8, 2>
        - Cycle 18: <5, 13, 18, 10>
        - Cycle 19: <5, 13, 9, 1>
        - Cycle 20: <5, 10, 1, 19>
        - Cycle 21: <5, 10, 17, 5>
        - Cycle 22: <5, 14, 15, 2>
        - Cycle 23: <6, 8, 2, 3>
        - Cycle 24: <6, 14, 15, 2>
        - Cycle 25: <6, 4, 12, 9>
        - Cycle 26: <7, 11, 3, 12>
        - Cycle 27: <7, 19, 0, 16>
        - Cycle 28: <8, 2, 3, 11>
        - Cycle 29: <8, 6, 14, 15>
        - Cycle 30: <9, 13, 18, 10>
        - Cycle 31: <9, 13, 5, 14>
        - Cycle 32: <9, 12, 4, 6>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (10, 18), 13>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (12, 3), 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (10, 1), 19>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (13, 18), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
