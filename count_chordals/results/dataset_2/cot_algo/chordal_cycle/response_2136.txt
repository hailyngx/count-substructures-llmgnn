- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (15, 0)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (9, 12)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (8, 5)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (19, 16)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (0, 4)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (4, 11)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (7, 19)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (17, 7)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (13, 4)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (6, 14)
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (3, 8)
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: (5, 4)
- Cycle 13 has 1 chord: (10, 14)
- Cycle 14 has 1 chord: (7, 12)
- Cycle 15 has 1 chord: (3, 15)
- Cycle 16 has 1 chord: (8, 11)
- Cycle 17 has 1 chord: (17, 18)
- Cycle 18 has 1 chord: (7, 16)
- Cycle 19 has 1 chord: (12, 18)
- Cycle 20 has 1 chord: (12, 16)
- Cycle 21 has 1 chord: (3, 19)
- Cycle 22 has 1 chord: (13, 9)
- Cycle 23 has 1 chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 24 has 1 chord: (12, 7)
- Cycle 25 has 1 chord: (12, 17)
- Cycle 26 has 1 chord: (13, 3)
- Cycle 27 has 1 chord: (6, 10)
- Cycle 28 has 1 chord: (0, 15)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <>
This graph does not contain any chordal 4-cycles.
