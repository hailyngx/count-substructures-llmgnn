Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 6, 4, 0, 5)
- (5, 3, 0, 4, 5)
- (5, 9, 1, 4, 5)
- (9, 2, 0, 8, 9)
- (9, 7, 0, 8, 9)
- (4, 6, 7, 0, 4)
- (8, 7, 6, 3, 8)
- (6, 5, 3, 0, 6)
- (2, 8, 1, 9, 2)
- (0, 3, 5, 6, 0)
- (7, 3, 5, 6, 7)
- (1, 2, 8, 9, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, (6, 4), 0, 5>
- <5, (3, 0), 4, 5>
- <5, (9, 1), 4, 5>
- <9, (2, 0), 8, 9>
- <9, (7, 0), 8, 9>
- <4, (6, 7), 0, 4>
- <8, (7, 6), 3, 8>
- <6, (5, 3), 0, 6>
- <2, (8, 1), 9, 2>
- <0, (3, 5), 6, 0>
- <7, (3, 5), 6, 7>
- <1, (2, 8), 9, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, there are 12 chordal 4-cycles [12].
