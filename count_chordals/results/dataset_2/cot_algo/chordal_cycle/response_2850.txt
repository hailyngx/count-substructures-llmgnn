Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 15) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 11) (18, 14) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 5) (16, 6) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 16) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 16) (4, 1) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 14, 18, 11, 10, 12, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 12, 16, 5, 8, 19, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 14, 18, 11, 9, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 9, 7, 0, 17, 10, 12, 1, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (10, 17, 15, 19, 8, 5, 0, 7, 10)

Step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 9, 4, 1) -> Chord: (3, 4)
    <1, (3, 4), 9>
  
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 14, 18, 11, 10, 12, 1) -> Chord: (18, 10)
    <2, (18, 10), 1>

- Cycle 3: (1, 12, 16, 5, 8, 19, 1) -> Chord: (5, 16)
    <3, (5, 16), 1>

- Cycle 4: (3, 9, 7, 0, 17, 10, 12, 1, 4, 9) -> Chord: (7, 12)
    <4, (7, 12), 3>

- Cycle 5: (10, 17, 15, 19, 8, 5, 0, 7, 10) -> Chord: (15, 8)
    <5, (15, 8), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [5].
