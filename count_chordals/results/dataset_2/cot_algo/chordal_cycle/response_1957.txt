Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 16) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 19) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 7) (13, 16) (13, 10) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 14) (9, 8) (9, 18) (17, 19) (17, 15) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 17) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 10) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 15) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 17) (15, 16) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <1, 3, 12, 2, 5> 
2. <4, 6, 16, 13, 10>
3. <18, 7, 0, 5, 2>
4. <19, 8, 9, 18, 4>
5. <7, 15, 17, 19, 1>
6. <11, 14, 10, 13, 16>

Step 2:
Identifying the chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, 3, 12, 2, 5> has a chord <1, 2, 5>
2. <4, 6, 16, 13, 10> has a chord <4, 13, 16>
3. <18, 7, 0, 5, 2> has a chord <18, 0, 5>
4. <19, 8, 9, 18, 4> has a chord <19, 9, 4>
5. <7, 15, 17, 19, 1> has a chord <7, 17, 1>
6. <11, 14, 10, 13, 16> has a chord <11, 10, 13>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
[6]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
