Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 5) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 11) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 16) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 0) (17, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 18) (19, 16) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (14, 11) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 0) (12, 1) (12, 0) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 5) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 5, 16, 3)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 3, 13, 1)
- Cycle 3: (8, 1, 10, 2, 8)
- Cycle 4: (11, 9, 11, 7, 11)
- Cycle 5: (4, 17, 0, 12, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has two chords: (15, 5) and (5, 16)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (3, 13)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 10)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (17, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (3, 13), 6>
- <2, (1, 10), 8>
- <7, (9, 7), 11>
- <12, (17, 12), 4>
- <3, (15, 5), 16>
