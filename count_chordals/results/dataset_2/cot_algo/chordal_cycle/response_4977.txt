Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
In this graph, there are multiple chordal 4-cycles. Let's find and count them:

Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 2, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 3, 8, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 0, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 0, 3, 8, 5)
- Cycle 8: (9, 4, 7, 2, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 1, 7, 2, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 3, 8, 2, 9)
- Cycle 11: (4, 7, 2, 8, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 6, 5, 7, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 8, 3, 9, 4)
- Cycle 14: (7, 2, 8, 3, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 1, 9, 3, 7)
- Cycle 16: (1, 7, 2, 8, 1)
- Cycle 17: (1, 0, 5, 7, 1)
- Cycle 18: (1, 2, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 19: (3, 8, 2, 7, 3)
- Cycle 20: (3, 9, 1, 7, 3)
- Cycle 21: (8, 2, 7, 1, 8)
- Cycle 22: (6, 5, 7, 2, 6)
- Cycle 23: (0, 1, 7, 2, 0)
- Cycle 24: (0, 3, 8, 2, 0)
- Cycle 25: (2, 7, 1, 9, 2)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (4, 7), 5> has one chord 4-7
- <2, (2, 7), 9> has one chord 2-7
- <3, (1, 7), 9> has one chord 1-7
- <4, (3, 8), 9> has one chord 3-8
- <5, (6, 7), 9> has one chord 6-7
- <6, (0, 1), 5> has one chord 0-1
- <7, (3, 8), 5> has one chord 3-8

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [7].
