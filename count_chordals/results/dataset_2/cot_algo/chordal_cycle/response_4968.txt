Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-6-9-7-5 with edges (5, 6), (6, 9), (9, 7), (7, 5)
- Cycle 2: 5-1-3-2-5 with edges (5, 1), (1, 3), (3, 2), (2, 5)
- Cycle 3: 5-3-2-6-5 with edges (5, 3), (3, 2), (2, 6), (6, 5)
- Cycle 4: 9-6-2-8-9 with edges (9, 6), (6, 2), (2, 8), (8, 9)
- Cycle 5: 9-7-4-8-9 with edges (9, 7), (7, 4), (4, 8), (8, 9)
- Cycle 6: 1-5-3-2-1 with edges (1, 5), (5, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1)
- Cycle 7: 1-5-6-2-1 with edges (1, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (2, 1)
- Cycle 8: 3-5-6-2-3 with edges (3, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (2, 3)
- Cycle 9: 2-6-7-4-2 with edges (2, 6), (6, 7), (7, 4), (4, 2)
- Cycle 10: 2-6-9-8-2 with edges (2, 6), (6, 9), (9, 8), (8, 2)
- Cycle 11: 8-9-7-4-8 with edges (8, 9), (9, 7), (7, 4), (4, 8)
- Cycle 12: 8-9-6-2-8 with edges (8, 9), (9, 6), (6, 2), (2, 8)
  
Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes):
- Cycle 1 has a chord: 5-6-9-7-5 with chord (6, 7)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: 5-1-3-2-5 with chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: 5-3-2-6-5 with chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: 9-6-2-8-9 with chord (6, 2)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: 9-7-4-8-9 with chord (7, 4)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: 1-5-3-2-1 with chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: 1-5-6-2-1 with chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: 3-5-6-2-3 with chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: 2-6-7-4-2 with chord (6, 7)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: 2-6-9-8-2 with chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: 8-9-7-4-8 with chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: 8-9-6-2-8 with chord (9, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, 6, 7, 9>, (6, 7)
<5, 1, 3, 2>, (1, 2)
<5, 3, 2, 6>, (3, 6)
<9, 6, 2, 8>, (6, 2)
<9, 7, 4, 8>, (7, 4)
<1, 5, 3, 2>, (5, 3)
<1, 5, 6, 2>, (5, 6)
<3, 5, 6, 2>, (5, 6)
<2, 6, 7, 4>, (6, 7)
<2, 6, 9, 8>, (6, 9)
<8, 9, 7, 4>, (9, 7)
<8, 9, 6, 2>, (9, 6)
