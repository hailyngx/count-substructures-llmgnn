Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are multiple cycles present in the graph. For the sake of brevity, let's focus on the 4-cycles.  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The 4-cycles and their corresponding unique chords are as follows:
1. <5, 4, 7, 3> has a chord (5, 7).
2. <4, 7, 8, 2> has a chord (4, 8).
3. <7, 8, 9, 2> has a chord (7, 9).
4. <7, 6, 5, 9> has a chord (5, 6).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [4] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
