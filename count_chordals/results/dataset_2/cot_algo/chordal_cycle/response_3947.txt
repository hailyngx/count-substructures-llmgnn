Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 15) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 19) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (11, 17) (11, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 15) (0, 19) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 14) (16, 10) (16, 13) (19, 9) (19, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <10, 17, 11, 7, 1, 2, 3, 8>
- Cycle 2: <10, 15, 4, 8, 2, 3, 10>
- Cycle 3: <10, 15, 0, 4, 13, 16, 10>
- Cycle 4: <2, 18, 0, 4, 15, 10, 3, 2>
- Cycle 5: <2, 18, 9, 1, 7, 11, 17, 10, 3, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 18, 9, 19, 0, 4, 13, 12, 1, 7, 11, 17, 10, 15, 3, 2>
- Cycle 7: <5, 6, 5>

Step 2:
Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord <1, 8>
- Cycle 2 has no chord
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has one chord <0, 10>
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has one chord <9, 13>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Chordal 4-cycles:
<10, 15, 0, 4, (13, 16), 10>
<2, 18, 0, 4, (15, 10), 3, 2>
