Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chords in the cycles are:
- (6, 25, 1, 15) : <1, 15>
- (6, 25, 1, 26) : <1, 26>
- (6, 25, 1, 15, 9) : <1, 9>
- (6, 25, 1, 26, 15) : <26, 15>
- (6, 25, 1, 15, 9) : <15, 9>
- (6, 25, 1, 26, 15) : <26, 15>
- (6, 25, 28, 14) : <6, 14>
- (6, 25, 28, 0) : <6, 0>
- (6, 25, 28, 14, 29) : <14, 29>
- (6, 25, 28, 0, 3) : <0, 3>
- (6, 25, 28, 14, 29, 20) : <14, 20>
- (6, 25, 28, 0, 3, 12) : <0, 12>

- (26, 29, 14, 17) : <14, 17>
- (26, 29, 14, 28) : <14, 28>
- (26, 29, 14, 17, 22) : <17, 22>
- (26, 29, 14, 28, 0) : <28, 0>
- (26, 29, 14, 17, 22, 20) : <17, 20>
- (26, 29, 14, 28, 0, 3) : <28, 3>

- (29, 14, 17, 23, 18, 28) : <23, 28>
- (14, 28, 6, 25, 1) : <6, 1>
- (14, 28, 6, 25, 1, 26) : <6, 26>
- (14, 28, 6, 25, 1, 15, 9) : <15, 9>
- (14, 28, 6, 25, 1, 26, 29) : <26, 29>
- (14, 28, 0, 3, 12) : <0, 12>
- (14, 28, 0, 3, 22) : <0, 22>
- (14, 28, 0, 3, 12, 27) : <12, 27>
- (14, 28, 0, 3, 22, 16) : <22, 16>
- (14, 28, 0, 3, 12, 27, 12) : <12, 27>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 38 cycles with exactly one chord. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [38].
