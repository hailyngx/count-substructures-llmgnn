Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2)

- Cycle 55: 8-7-9-6-8
- Cycle 56: 8-5-7-0-8
- Cycle 57: 5-8-7-9-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, 0, 2, 9> (chord: 2)
<4, 0, 3, 9> (chord: 3)
<6, 1, 3, 0> (chord: 3)
<6, 1, 0, 9> (chord: 9)
<6, 9, 4, 0> (chord: 4)
<8, 6, 1, 3> (chord: 1)
<8, 6, 1, 2> (chord: 2)
<8, 7, 9, 4> (chord: 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
