Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-14-7-5
- Cycle 2: 5-12-6-3-7-5
- Cycle 3: 5-12-1-4-11-5
- Cycle 4: 5-8-13-3-6-12-5
- Cycle 5: 9-14-7-4-1-10-13-0-9
- Cycle 6: 4-11-12-9-14-7-4
- Cycle 7: 7-14-9-12-6-3-7
- Cycle 8: 1-4-2-3-13-10-1
- Cycle 9: 3-7-1-8-13-10-3
- Cycle 10: 8-2-14-9-12-6-3-13-8
- Cycle 11: 6-3-7-14-2-8-13-10-6
- Cycle 12: 0-13-10-1-4-11-12-6-0

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (10, 13), 12>
- <2, (8, 14), 7>
- <3, (6, 12), 5>
- <4, (9, 7), 12>
- <5, (8, 13), 6>
- <6, (1, 9), 4>
- <7, (1, 3), 8>
- <8, (2, 13), 10>
- <9, (4, 12), 11>
- <10, (5, 12), 6>
- <11, (1, 10), 13>
- <12, (7, 14), 4>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]
