Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: 1-8-10-11-1
        - Cycle 2: 1-8-14-0-1
        - Cycle 3: 1-14-6-7-1
        - Cycle 4: 1-12-4-9-1
        - Cycle 5: 12-4-9-3-12
        - Cycle 6: 12-3-10-6-12

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 1: 1-8-10-11-1 -> Chord: (10, 11)
        - Cycle 2: 1-8-14-0-1 -> Chord: (8, 0)
        - Cycle 3: 1-14-6-7-1 -> Chord: (14, 6)
        - Cycle 4: 1-12-4-9-1 -> Chord: (12, 9)
        - Cycle 5: 12-4-9-3-12 -> Chord: (4, 3)
        - Cycle 6: 12-3-10-6-12 -> Chord: (3, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = 0
Therefore, the final answer is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        - There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
