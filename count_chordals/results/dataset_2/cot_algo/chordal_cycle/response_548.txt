Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 4 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 3: 1 - 4 - 5 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 5: 2 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 6: 2 - 8 - 9 - 0 - 2
- Cycle 7: 3 - 5 - 6 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 8: 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 9: 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 10: 8 - 6 - 5 - 3 - 8

Step 2: Identify the chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (1, 4), 5, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (2, 3), 5, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (4, 7), 5, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (6, 7), 8, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, (3, 5), 7, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <2, (8, 9), 0, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, (5, 6), 8, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, (5, 6), 7, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <5, (6, 7), 8, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <8, (5, 3), 6, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [10] chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
