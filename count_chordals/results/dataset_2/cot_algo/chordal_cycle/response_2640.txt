Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 8) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 14) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 

There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the given graph. Let's list them out:
- Cycle 1: 1-9-2-14-1
- Cycle 2: 1-8-7-12-1
- Cycle 3: 2-9-4-6-2
- Cycle 4: 3-6-4-9-3
- Cycle 5: 3-1-14-2-3
- Cycle 6: 3-10-7-12-3
- Cycle 7: 3-4-9-2-3
- Cycle 8: 4-9-1-3-4
- Cycle 9: 5-12-7-10-5
- Cycle 10: 5-0-8-14-5
- Cycle 11: 5-11-2-9-5
- Cycle 12: 8-1-13-0-8
- Cycle 13: 8-7-10-5-8
- Cycle 14: 8-12-3-1-8
- Cycle 15: 13-1-9-11-13
- Cycle 16: 13-0-5-11-13

Step 2:

Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (2, 14), 9>
- Cycle 2: <1, (7, 12), 8>
- Cycle 3: <2, (4, 6), 9>
- Cycle 4: <3, (4, 9), 6>
- Cycle 5: <3, (2, 14), 1>
- Cycle 6: <3, (7, 12), 10>
- Cycle 7: <3, (9, 2), 4>
- Cycle 8: <4, (1, 3), 9>
- Cycle 9: <5, (7, 10), 12>
- Cycle 10: <5, (8, 14), 0>
- Cycle 11: <5, (2, 9), 11>
- Cycle 12: <8, (1, 13), 0>
- Cycle 13: <8, (10, 5), 7>
- Cycle 14: <8, (3, 1), 12>
- Cycle 15: <13, (9, 11), 1>
- Cycle 16: <13, (5, 11), 0>

Step 3:

Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we find there are [16] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
