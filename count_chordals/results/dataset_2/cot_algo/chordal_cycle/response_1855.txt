Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 4 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 1 - 0 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 1 - 2 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 1 - 9 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 5: 6 - 8 - 7 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 6: 6 - 8 - 5 - 2 - 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Among the cycles listed above, the following chordal 4-cycle is found:
- <6, (9, 4), 2, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final result is [1].
