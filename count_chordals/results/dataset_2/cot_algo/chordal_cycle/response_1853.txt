Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (17, 16) (17, 12) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 3) (4, 19) (4, 15) (18, 0) (18, 3) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 6) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 2) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 10, 11, 8, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 10, 11, 14, 9, 8, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 10, 11, 14, 11, 10, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 18, 3, 13, 8, 12, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 18, 3, 13, 8, 9, 1, 2, 12, 0)
- Cycle 6: (2, 1, 9, 8, 12, 17, 16, 3, 18, 0, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 12, 17, 16, 3, 13, 8, 11, 10, 0, 18, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 15, 6, 7, 0, 12, 17, 16, 6, 19, 2)
- Cycle 9: (3, 13, 8, 9, 1, 2, 19, 6, 16, 17, 12, 0, 18, 3)
- Cycle 10: (4, 15, 2, 1, 9, 8, 12, 2, 19, 6, 15, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 15, 6, 7, 0, 10, 11, 14, 9, 1, 2, 19, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 19, 2, 1, 9, 8, 13, 3, 16, 6, 15, 4)
- Cycle 13: (6, 15, 4, 19, 3, 18, 0, 10, 11, 8, 13, 6)
- Cycle 14: (6, 15, 2, 12, 17, 16, 3, 13, 8, 9, 1, 2, 6)
- Cycle 15: (6, 16, 3, 13, 8, 12, 17, 16, 6)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord (10, 8)
- Cycle 2: Chord (11, 9)
- Cycle 3: Chord (11, 10)
- Cycle 4: Chord (13, 12)
- Cycle 5: Chords (13, 9), (1, 12)
- Cycle 6: Chord (1, 16)
- Cycle 7: Chord (8, 10)
- Cycle 8: Chord (15, 16)
- Cycle 9: Chord (9, 16)
- Cycle 10: Chord (15, 8)
- Cycle 11: Chord (10, 9)
- Cycle 12: Chords (15, 8), (1, 3)
- Cycle 13: Chord (13, 1)
- Cycle 14: Chord (15, 1)
- Cycle 15: Chord (3, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [15]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 10, 11, 14>, Chord: (11, 9)
<2, 1, 9, 8>, Chord: (1, 16)
<6, 15, 2, 12>, Chord: (15, 16)
<6, 16, 3, 13>, Chord: (3, 13)
<0, 18, 3, 13>, Chord: (13, 12)
