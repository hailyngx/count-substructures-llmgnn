Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-7-5-8-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-4-1-0
- Cycle 4: 0-3-6-7-0
- Cycle 5: 0-4-2-8-0
- Cycle 6: 1-2-4-3-1
- Cycle 7: 2-4-1-7-2

Step 2:
Among these cycles, we need to check for exactly one chord. 
There is only one chordal 4-cycle in the given graph:
- <0, (1, 7), 5>

Step 3:
After checking all cycles, we found 1 chordal 4-cycle.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
