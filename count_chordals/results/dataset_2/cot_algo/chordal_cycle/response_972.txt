Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 17) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 19) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 14) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 16) (11, 15) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 2) (12, 15) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 15) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 16) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
        - Cycle 1: 15-18-0-8-13-2-4-14-15
        - Cycle 2: 5-14-4-2-13-3-16-5
        - Cycle 3: 15-14-4-19-17-13-3-16-15
        - Cycle 4: 16-3-13-2-4-19-17-10-16
        - Cycle 5: 0-18-1-5-14-4-19-2-0
        - Cycle 6: 7-0-18-1-5-16-3-13-7
        - Cycle 7: 7-0-8-13-2-19-4-14-7
        - Cycle 8: 16-5-1-18-0-7-16
        - Cycle 9: 7-16-3-13-2-19-17-7
        - Cycle 10: 10-17-13-3-16-1-5-10
        - Cycle 11: 11-15-14-4-19-2-13-7-11
        - Cycle 12: 1-5-14-4-19-17-10-16-1
        - Cycle 13: 12-15-14-4-19-2-13-3-12
        - Cycle 14: 6-7-0-18-1-5-8-13-6

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <15, (14, 4), 19, 17>
        - <5, (14, 4), 19, 17>
        - <15, 14, 4, 19>
        - <16, 3, 13, 2>
        - <0, 18, 1, 5>
        - <7, 0, 8, 13>
        - <7, 0, 8, 13>
        - <16, 5, 1, 18>
        - <7, 16, 3, 13>
        - <10, 17, 13, 3>
        - <11, 15, 14, 4>
        - <1, 5, 14, 4>
        - <12, 15, 14, 4>
        - <6, 7, 0, 18>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal cycles:
        There are 14 chordal 4-cycles found.
        
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
