Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 11) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-4-13-1
- Cycle 2: 1-7-12-2-1
- Cycle 3: 3-4-8-12-3
- Cycle 4: 3-5-14-11-3
- Cycle 5: 4-13-9-7-4
- Cycle 6: 7-12-8-4-7
- Cycle 7: 2-12-8-4-2
- Cycle 8: 2-9-13-4-2
- Cycle 9: 2-11-14-5-2
- Cycle 10: 6-14-5-3-6
- Cycle 11: 6-11-2-12-6
- Cycle 12: 6-12-7-1-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

Chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (4, 13), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
