Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
    - Cycle 1: 5-9-2-5
    - Cycle 2: 5-4-7-1-5
    - Cycle 3: 4-0-3-1-4
    - Cycle 4: 7-8-2-5-7
    - Cycle 5: 1-3-8-2-1
    - Cycle 6: 3-5-2-8-3
    - Cycle 7: 2-9-0-4-2
    - Cycle 8: 8-7-4-0-8
    - Cycle 9: 0-6-2-8-0

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
    - Cycle 1 is chordal with chord (9, 2)
    - Cycle 2 is chordal with chord (4, 7)
    - Cycle 3 is chordal with chord (0, 1)
    - Cycle 4 is chordal with chord (8, 2)
    - Cycle 5 is chordal with chord (3, 8)
    - Cycle 6 is not chordal
    - Cycle 7 is not chordal
    - Cycle 8 is chordal with chord (7, 4)
    - Cycle 9 is chordal with chord (6, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
    There are 6 chordal cycles: Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, Cycle 5, and Cycle 8.

Putting the final number inside brackets gives [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
    - <1, (9, 2), 5>
    - <2, (4, 7), 5>
    - <3, (0, 1), 4>
    - <4, (8, 2), 7>
    - <5, (3, 8), 1>
    - <6, 7, 8, 4>
