Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 22) (15, 17) (27, 0) (27, 26) (27, 1) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 13) (9, 23) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (22, 15) (22, 11) (23, 9) (23, 4) (23, 25) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 20) (11, 22) (11, 10) (11, 21) (11, 29) (11, 25) (2, 8) (2, 28) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 28) (12, 7) (12, 29) (12, 3) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 21) (4, 23) (4, 5) (4, 25) (24, 19) (26, 27) (26, 20) (26, 3) (26, 17) (21, 9) (21, 11) (21, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 29) (19, 24) (19, 1) (16, 0) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 26) (29, 11) (29, 12) (29, 5) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 26) (1, 27) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 20) (20, 10) (20, 26) (20, 1) (14, 28) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (28, 2) (28, 7) (28, 14) (25, 23) (25, 11) (25, 4) 

Response:
After listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, we find the following two chordal 4-cycles:

1. <0, 1, 20, 26> with chord (1, 20)
2. <5, 4, 25, 23> with chord (4, 25)

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
