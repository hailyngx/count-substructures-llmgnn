Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-4-9-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-9-4-1
- Cycle 4: 3-7-9-4-3
- Cycle 5: 4-3-0-6-4
- Cycle 6: 4-6-8-2-4
- Cycle 7: 6-1-5-2-6
- Cycle 8: 1-5-2-6-1
- Cycle 9: 2-6-0-3-2
- Cycle 10: 4-9-7-8-4

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (5, 9), 4>
- <2, (6, 4), 9>
- <3, (7, 9), 4>
- <4, (7, 9), 3>
- <5, (0, 6), 4>
- <6, (8, 2), 4>
- <7, (1, 5), 2>
- <8, (2, 6), 1>
- <9, (0, 3), 2>
- <10, (7, 8), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
