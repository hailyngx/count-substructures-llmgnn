Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - (5, 9, 1, 6) 
        - (5, 9, 3, 8) 
        - (5, 9, 7, 4) 
        - (5, 2, 1, 6) 
        - (5, 2, 3, 8) 
        - (5, 2, 8, 0) 
        - (5, 8, 3, 9) 
        - (5, 8, 6, 7) 
        - (5, 8, 2, 0) 
        - (9, 3, 2, 8) 
        - (9, 3, 8, 6) 
        - (9, 1, 2, 5) 
        - (9, 1, 6, 7) 
        - (9, 1, 0, 8) 
        - (9, 7, 4, 7) 
        - (7, 4, 7, 9) 
        - (7, 6, 1, 9) 
        - (7, 6, 5, 2) 
        - (7, 5, 2, 1) 
        - (7, 5, 9, 3) 
        - (1, 9, 7, 4) 
        - (1, 9, 5, 2) 
        - (1, 6, 7, 5) 
        - (1, 6, 5, 2) 
        - (3, 9, 1, 0) 
        - (3, 9, 5, 8) 
        - (3, 8, 5, 2) 
        - (3, 8, 6, 7) 
        - (6, 5, 2, 1) 
        - (6, 5, 8, 3) 
        - (6, 7, 4, 7) 
        - (6, 7, 9, 3) 
        - (2, 5, 8, 0) 
        - (2, 5, 9, 1) 
        - (2, 3, 9, 1) 
        - (2, 3, 8, 6) 
        - (2, 8, 5, 6) 
        - (2, 8, 0, 9) 
        - (8, 5, 6, 7) 
        - (8, 5, 2, 3) 
        - (8, 3, 9, 1) 
        - (8, 3, 2, 5) 
        - (8, 6, 7, 4) 
        - (8, 6, 1, 9) 
        - (8, 2, 5, 9) 
        - (8, 2, 0, 9) 
        - (0, 9, 1, 6) 
        - (0, 9, 4, 7) 
        - (0, 1, 6, 5) 
        - (0, 1, 2, 5) 
        - (0, 2, 5, 8) 
        - (0, 2, 8, 3) 
        - (0, 8, 3, 9) 
        - (0, 8, 6, 7) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <5, 9, 1, 6> (chord: (9, 1)) 
        - <5, 9, 3, 8> (chord: (9, 3)) 
        - <5, 9, 7, 4> (chord: (9, 7)) 
        - <5, 2, 1, 6> (chord: (2, 1)) 
        - <5, 2, 3, 8> (chord: (2, 3)) 
        - <5, 2, 8, 0> (chord: (2, 8)) 
        - <5, 8, 3, 9> (chord: (8, 3)) 
        - <5, 8, 6, 7> (chord: (8, 6)) 
        - <5, 8, 2, 0> (chord: (8, 2)) 
        - <9, 3, 2, 8> (chord: (3, 2)) 
        - <9, 1, 2, 5> (chord: (1, 2)) 
        - <7, 4, 7, 9> (chord: (4, 9)) 
        - <7, 6, 1, 9> (chord: (6, 1)) 
        - <3, 9, 1, 0> (chord: (9, 1)) 
        - <3, 8, 5, 2> (chord: (8, 5)) 
        - <6, 5, 2, 1> (chord: (5, 2)) 
        - <2, 3, 9, 1> (chord: (3, 1)) 
        - <8, 5, 6, 7> (chord: (5, 6)) 
        - <8, 3, 9, 1> (chord: (3, 1)) 
        - <0, 9, 4, 7> (chord: (9, 4)) 
        - <0, 1, 6, 5> (chord: (1, 6)) 
        - <0, 2, 8, 3> (chord: (2, 3))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [22]
