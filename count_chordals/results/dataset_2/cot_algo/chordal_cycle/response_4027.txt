Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (14, 4) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 16) (12, 10) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 18) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 8) (19, 0) (4, 14) (4, 0) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 13) (15, 11) (15, 9) (15, 18) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 10-17-5-2-10
        - Cycle 2: 10-17-5-8-10
        - Cycle 3: 10-12-16-2-10
        - Cycle 4: 10-12-16-11-10
        - Cycle 5: 10-12-16-2-5-10
        - Cycle 6: 10-12-16-11-15-9-10
        - Cycle 7: 10-13-5-2-10
        - Cycle 8: 10-13-1-7-11-15-9-10
        - Cycle 9: 10-13-1-7-6-9-10
        - Cycle 10: 10-13-1-7-6-3-8-10
        - Cycle 11: 10-1-7-6-9-15-11-10
        - Cycle 12: 10-1-13-5-8-10
        - Cycle 13: 10-1-13-18-0-19-8-10
        - Cycle 14: 17-5-2-16-12-10-17
        - Cycle 15: 17-5-8-10-12-16-2-17
        - Cycle 16: 17-10-12-16-2-5-17
        - Cycle 17: 17-10-12-16-11-15-9-17
        - Cycle 18: 5-13-1-7-6-9-15-5
        - Cycle 19: 5-2-16-12-10-1-13-5
        - Cycle 20: 5-2-16-11-15-9-6-5

Step 2: Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - <10, (17, 5), 2, 12>
        - <10, (17, 5), 8, 10>
        - <10, (16, 2), 12, 10>
        - <10, (16, 11), 12, 10>
        - <10, (16, 2), 5, 10>
        - <10, (16, 11), 15, 9, 10>
        - <10, (13, 5), 2, 10>
        - <10, (13, 1), 15, 9, 7, 10>
        - <10, (13, 1), 6, 9, 7, 10>
        - <10, (13, 1), 3, 8, 10>
        - <10, (1, 7), 15, 9, 11, 10>
        - <10, (1, 13), 5, 8, 10>
        - <10, (1, 13), 0, 19, 8, 10>
        - <17, (5, 2), 16, 12>
        - <17, (5, 8), 10, 12, 16>
        - <17, (10, 12), 16, 2, 17>
        - <17, (10, 16), 11, 15, 9, 17>
        - <5, (13, 1), 7, 6, 9, 15>
        - <5, (2, 16), 12, 10, 1, 13>
        - <5, (2, 16), 11, 15, 9, 6, 5>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [19]

I have listed all the unique chordal 4-cycles found above. Let me know if you need any more assistance!
