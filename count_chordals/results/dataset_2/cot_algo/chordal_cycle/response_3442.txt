Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-13-8-1
- Cycle 2: 1-8-7-10-1
- Cycle 3: 1-8-7-5-14-12-6-11-1
- Cycle 4: 1-8-0-2-12-6-11-1
- Cycle 5: 1-11-6-12-9-4-1
- Cycle 6: 3-13-7-14-4-9-3
- Cycle 7: 3-13-8-7-14-12-2-0-3
- Cycle 8: 5-7-0-2-12-9-4-14-5

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (13, 8), 3, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (8, 7), 5, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (8, 7), (12, 6), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (8, 0), (12, 2), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (11, 6), 12, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <3, (13, 7), 14, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, (13, 8), (12, 2), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, (7, 0), (12, 2), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
