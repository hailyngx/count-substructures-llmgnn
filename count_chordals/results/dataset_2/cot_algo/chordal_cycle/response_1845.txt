Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 8) (14, 17) (14, 2) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 4) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 5) (8, 3) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 0) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 17) (16, 7) (16, 19) (15, 0) (15, 13) (18, 0) (18, 5) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 4) (11, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 15) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 5) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
<6, 9, 13, 19, 0> 
<6, 4, 1, 7, 12> 
<6, 4, 17, 16, 7> 
<6, 0, 19, 16, 7> 
<9, 13, 19, 16, 7> 
<1, 7, 12, 17, 16> 
<1, 3, 10, 17, 16> 
<3, 10, 17, 16, 7> 
<14, 17, 10, 2, 11> 
<14, 17, 4, 5, 18> 
<16, 17, 4, 5, 18> 
<16, 7, 12, 17, 14> 
<19, 13, 15, 0, 18> 
<19, 8, 3, 10, 17> 
<0, 15, 13, 9, 6> 

Step 2:
- The unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph are: 
<6, 9, 13, 19> (6, 13) as chord 
<6, 4, 1, 7> (4, 1) as chord 
<6, 4, 17, 16> (4, 17) as chord 
<6, 0, 19, 16> (0, 19) as chord 
<1, 7, 12, 17> (7, 12) as chord 
<1, 3, 10, 17> (3, 10) as chord 
<3, 10, 17, 16> (10, 17) as chord 
<14, 17, 10, 2> (14, 2) as chord 
<14, 17, 4, 5> (4, 5) as chord 
<16, 17, 4, 5> (17, 5) as chord 
<16, 7, 12, 17> (7, 12) as chord 
<19, 13, 15, 0> (13, 15) as chord 
<19, 8, 3, 10> (8, 3) as chord 
<0, 15, 13, 9> (15, 13) as chord 

Step 3:
- There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final number is [14].
