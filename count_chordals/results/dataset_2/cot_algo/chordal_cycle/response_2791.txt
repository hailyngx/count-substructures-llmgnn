Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 2) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 17) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 19) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 19) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 6) (14, 5) (14, 16) (14, 4) (7, 19) (7, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 15) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 18) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (8, 0) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 13) 

Response:
Step 1:  List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 9, 2, 15, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 14, 16, 12, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 14, 4, 17, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 14, 4, 12, 13, 5)
- Cycle 5: (15, 9, 1, 0, 18, 15)
- Cycle 6: (15, 17, 4, 12, 13, 15)
- Cycle 7: (12, 10, 11, 13, 12)
- Cycle 8: (12, 19, 1, 0, 18, 12)
- Cycle 9: (0, 8, 18, 6, 17, 0)
- Cycle 10: (6, 19, 12, 13, 7, 6)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- <1, 9, 15, 2> (Chord: (9, 15))
- <4, 12, 16, 14> (Chord: (12,16))
- <4, 6, 17, 14> (Chord: (6, 17))
- <4, 12, 13, 5> (Chord: (12, 13))
- <0, 1, 9, 19> (Chord: (1, 9))
- <4, 12, 13, 15> (Chord: (12, 13))
- <10, 11, 13, 12> (Chord: (11, 13))
- <0, 1, 19, 12> (Chord: (1, 19))
- <0, 6, 18, 8> (Chord: (6, 18))
- <6, 7, 13, 12> (Chord: (7, 13))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
