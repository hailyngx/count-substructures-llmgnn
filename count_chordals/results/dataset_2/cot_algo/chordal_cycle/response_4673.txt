Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 16) (11, 6) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 12) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 7) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 10) (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 18) (4, 9) (4, 17) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (12, 19) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 16) (18, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 8, 3, 14, 5, 19, 15, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 13, 10, 9, 4, 17, 7, 2, 0, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 13, 10, 9, 6, 11, 6, 13, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 15, 19, 7, 2, 0, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 15, 10, 9, 4, 17, 7, 16, 3, 8, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 13, 6, 11, 6, 13, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 15, 19, 7, 16, 3, 14, 5, 19, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has chord (9, 17).
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has chord (19, 7).
- Cycle 5 has chord (10, 17).
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has chord (19, 7).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 13, 10, 9, (4, 17), 7, 2> 
<1, 15, 19, (7, 2), 0, 1>
<1, 15, 19, 7, 16, 3, 14, 5, 19, 15>
