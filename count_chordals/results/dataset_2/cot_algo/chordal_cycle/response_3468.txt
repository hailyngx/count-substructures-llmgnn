Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 20) (11, 15) (16, 25) (16, 3) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 27) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 27) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 10) (0, 7) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 20) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 13) (8, 10) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 29) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 28) (18, 17) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 20) (9, 23) (22, 2) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 20) (17, 18) (17, 7) (7, 0) (7, 17) (7, 24) (7, 23) (28, 18) (28, 15) (6, 24) (6, 12) (24, 7) (24, 6) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 29) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 28) (15, 21) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 25) (20, 11) (20, 14) (20, 9) (20, 22) (29, 4) (29, 5) (29, 13) (29, 21) (27, 1) (27, 3) (27, 22) (25, 16) (25, 19) (25, 21) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 29) (23, 9) (23, 7) (21, 15) (21, 29) (21, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are two cycles of length 4 in the graph: <11, 5, 26, 1> and <11, 15, 28, 18>.

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - <11, 5, 26, 1> has one chord (11, 26)
    - <11, 15, 28, 18> has one chord (15, 18)

Step 3:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are <11, 5, 26, 1> and <11, 15, 28, 18>.
