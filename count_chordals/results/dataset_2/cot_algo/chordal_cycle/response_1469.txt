Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 15) (5, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 18) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 12) (14, 16) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 17) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 18) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 6) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 6) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (4, 0) (4, 17) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 16) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 15) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 8) (17, 4) (18, 11) (18, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 19, 13, 10, 6, 12, 7, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 19, 13, 10, 6, 16, 15, 8, 17, 2, 7, 12, 14, 16)
- Cycle 3: (11, 10, 6, 12, 7, 2, 0, 4, 17, 8, 18, 11)
- Cycle 4: (12, 17, 4, 0, 2, 7, 3, 5, 15, 8, 18, 11, 1, 10, 6)
- Cycle 5: (3, 7, 12, 14, 16, 15, 5, 19, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 has chord (13, 6)
- Cycle 2 has chord (15, 16)
- Cycle 3 has chord (17, 0)
- Cycle 4 has chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 5 has chord (12, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- Cycle 1: <1, (13, 6)>
- Cycle 2: <2, (15, 16)>
- Cycle 3: <3, (17, 0)>
- Cycle 4: <4, (8, 4)>
- Cycle 5: <5, (12, 5)>
