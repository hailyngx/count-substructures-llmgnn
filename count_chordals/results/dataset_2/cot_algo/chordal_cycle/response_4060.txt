30. Cycle 30: (6, 13, 3, 1, 6)
31. Cycle 31: (6, 13, 9, 0, 6)
32. Cycle 32: (7, 0, 9, 13, 7)
33. Cycle 33: (8, 2, 1, 3, 8)
34. Cycle 34: (8, 2, 14, 6, 8)
35. Cycle 35: (9, 0, 7, 11, 9)
36. Cycle 36: (9, 0, 10, 6, 9)
37. Cycle 37: (9, 12, 4, 8, 9)
38. Cycle 38: (10, 2, 1, 3, 10)
39. Cycle 39: (10, 2, 14, 6, 10)
40. Cycle 40: (10, 5, 3, 13, 10)
41. Cycle 41: (11, 0, 7, 13, 11)
42. Cycle 42: (11, 2, 1, 3, 11)
43. Cycle 43: (12, 4, 8, 2, 12)
44. Cycle 44: (12, 4, 14, 2, 12)
45. Cycle 45: (12, 5, 3, 13, 12)

47. Cycle 47: (13, 3, 5, 12, 13)
48. Cycle 48: (13, 6, 10, 2, 13)
49. Cycle 49: (13, 6, 14, 12, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 2: (0, 9, 13, 6, 0) has one unique chord (9, 6), creating a chordal 4-cycle <0, (6, 9), 13>.
- Cycle 9: (2, 14, 6, 10, 2) has one unique chord (14, 10), creating a chordal 4-cycle <2, (6, 14), 10>.
- Cycle 31: (6, 13, 3, 1, 6) has one unique chord (13, 1), creating a chordal 4-cycle <6, (3, 13), 1>.
- Cycle 41: (11, 0, 7, 13, 11) has one unique chord (0, 7), creating a chordal 4-cycle <11, (7, 0), 13>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
