Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 5) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 1) (2, 29) (2, 1) (29, 11) (29, 2) (29, 9) (29, 15) (12, 22) (12, 26) (27, 18) (27, 10) (10, 27) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 6) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 24) (20, 0) (20, 23) (22, 12) (22, 26) (22, 21) (26, 12) (26, 22) (26, 21) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 25) (28, 16) (28, 0) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 3) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 14) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 24) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 7) (14, 21) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 15) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 18) (19, 4) (15, 29) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 25) (18, 27) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 11) (5, 18) (25, 24) (25, 21) (25, 15) (13, 10) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 11-16-1-2-11
- Cycle 2: 11-29-15-14-11
- Cycle 3: 11-24-0-20-11
- Cycle 4: 16-28-0-24-16
- Cycle 5: 27-18-14-6-27
- Cycle 6: 10-17-6-14-10
- Cycle 7: 10-27-18-14-10
- Cycle 8: 21-25-15-29-21
- Cycle 9: 21-10-13-1-21

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (1, 16)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (15, 29)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (0, 24)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (0, 28)
- Cycle 5 does not have a chord
- Cycle 6 does not have a chord
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (18, 14)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (15, 25)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (1, 13)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles is [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (1, 16), 2)>
<2, (15, 29), 11)>
<3, (0, 24), 11)>
<4, (0, 28), 16)>
<5, (18, 14), 10)>
