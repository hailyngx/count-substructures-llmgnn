Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 1) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are several cycles in the graph, such as (0, 1, 11, 5), (2, 1, 11, 4), (3, 7, 13, 4), etc.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- One of the cycles that has exactly one chord is <6, (7, 13), 0, 3>.
- Another cycle with one chord is <9, (12, 1), 1, 11>.
- Finally, <5, (8, 1), 11, 4> is another cycle with exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- As we found <6, (7, 13), 0, 3>, <9, (12, 1), 1, 11>, and <5, (8, 1), 11, 4>, there are [3] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
