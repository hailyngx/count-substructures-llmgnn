Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 7 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 3 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 1 - 4 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 6 - 7 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 9
- Cycle 6: 4 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 7: 7 - 6 - 5 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 8: 1 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 9: 3 - 4 - 7 - 6 - 3
- Cycle 10: 6 - 7 - 4 - 1 - 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: <5, 7>
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: <4, 9>
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: <1, 7>
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: <6, 9>
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: <5, 7>
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: <4, 6>
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: <5, 6>
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord: <1, 5>
- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord: <4, 7>
- Cycle 10 has exactly one chord: <1, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
