Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 19) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 17) (4, 5) (18, 9) (18, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 2) (15, 10) (15, 0) (7, 8) (16, 13) (16, 12) (2, 17) (2, 5) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 14) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 19) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 5) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: <8, 13, 16, 12, 8>
        - Cycle 2: <10, 11, 17, 1, 10>
        - Cycle 3: <10, 15, 0, 12, 10>
        - Cycle 4: <1, 10, 15, 0, 1>
        - Cycle 5: <1, 17, 11, 10, 1>
        - Cycle 6: <11, 17, 1, 6, 11>
        - Cycle 7: <9, 10, 15, 0, 9>
        - Cycle 8: <9, 18, 1, 6, 9>
        - Cycle 9: <5, 8, 13, 16, 5>
        - Cycle 10: <5, 2, 17, 11, 5>
        - Cycle 11: <5, 0, 15, 10, 5>
        - Cycle 12: <5, 4, 1, 6, 5>
        - Cycle 13: <12, 16, 13, 8, 12>
        - Cycle 14: <14, 8, 13, 16, 14>
        - Cycle 15: <14, 19, 13, 8, 14>
        - Cycle 16: <14, 9, 18, 1, 14>
        - Cycle 17: <14, 6, 1, 10, 14>
        - Cycle 18: <14, 19, 12, 0, 14>
        - Cycle 19: <0, 11, 17, 2, 0>
        - Cycle 20: <0, 12, 16, 13, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 2 <10, 11, 17, 1, 10> has a chord (11, 1): <10, 11, (17, 1), 10>
        - Cycle 3 <10, 15, 0, 12, 10> has a chord (15, 12): <10, 15, (0, 12), 10>
        - Cycle 4 <1, 10, 15, 0, 1> has a chord (10, 15): <1, 10, (15, 0), 1>
        - Cycle 6 <11, 17, 1, 6, 11> has a chord (17, 6): <11, 17, (1, 6), 11>
        - Cycle 10 <5, 2, 17, 11, 5> has a chord (2, 11): <5, 2, (17, 11), 5>
        - Cycle 12 <5, 4, 1, 6, 5> has a chord (4, 1): <5, 4, (1, 6), 5>
        - Cycle 16 <14, 9, 18, 1, 14> has a chord (9, 18): <14, 9, (18, 1), 14>
        - Cycle 17 <14, 6, 1, 10, 14> has a chord (6, 10): <14, 6, (1, 10), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are a total of [8] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
