        - Cycle 11: (6, 2, 24, 5, 20, 0, 14, 29, 14)
        - Cycle 12: (6, 9, 6)
        - Cycle 13: (6, 20, 0, 14, 29, 14, 3, 10)
        - Cycle 14: (6, 28, 17, 10, 23, 1, 24, 5, 20)
        - Cycle 15: (7, 25, 5, 20, 0)
        - Cycle 16: (8, 17, 10, 23, 1, 24, 27)
        - Cycle 17: (8, 27, 26, 16, 19, 12, 2)
        - Cycle 18: (9, 6, 20, 0)

        - Cycle 24: (15, 21, 17, 10)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (23, 10), 8>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (24, 1), 12>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (0, 20), 14>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (1, 24), 11>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (26, 4), 20>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (2, 12), 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (5, 20), 25>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (26, 27), 17>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (6, 20), 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (17, 10), 23>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <11, (1, 24), 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <12, (19, 16), 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <13, (5, 20), 22>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 14: <14, (20, 27), 0>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 15: <15, (17, 10), 21>

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles = [15]
