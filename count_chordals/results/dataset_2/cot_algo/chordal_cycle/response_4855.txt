Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (4, 10, 13, 8) with chord (10, 8)
- Cycle 2: (4, 10, 13, 14) with chord (10, 14)
- Cycle 3: (4, 11, 14, 13) with chord (11, 13)
- Cycle 4: (7, 11, 14, 13) with chord (11, 13)
- Cycle 5: (8, 13, 14, 10) with chord (13, 10)
- Cycle 6: (5, 6, 0, 7) with chord (6, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1: (4, 10, 13, 8) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (10, 8) <4, 8, 10, 13>
- Cycle 2: (4, 10, 13, 14) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (10, 14) <4, 10, 14, 13>
- Cycle 3: (4, 11, 14, 13) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (11, 13) <4, 11, 13, 14>
- Cycle 6: (5, 6, 0, 7) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (6, 7) <5, 6, 7, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
