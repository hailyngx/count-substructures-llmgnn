- (12, 7, 0, 14, 1)
- (12, 15, 9, 2)
- (13, 2, 5, 18)

Step 2: Checking for one chord:
- (0, 7, 12, 15) - Chord: (7, 12)
- (0, 7, 12, 18) - Chord: (7, 12)
- (0, 14, 13, 2) - Chord: (14, 2)
- (0, 14, 1, 9) - Chord: (14, 9)
- (1, 14, 13, 2) - Chord: (14, 2)
- (1, 10, 8, 6) - Chord: (10, 8)
- (1, 14, 13, 2) - Chord: (14, 2)
- (2, 5, 18, 17) - Chord: (5, 17)
- (4, 13, 14, 0) - Chord: (13, 0)
- (7, 0, 14, 13) - Chord: (0, 14)
- (9, 4, 13, 2) - Chord: (4, 13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
Thus, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 7, 12, 15>
<0, 7, 12, 18>
<0, 14, 13, 2>
<0, 14, 1, 9>
<1, 14, 13, 2>
<1, 10, 8, 6>
<2, 5, 18, 17>
<4, 13, 14, 0>
<7, 0, 14, 13>
<9, 4, 13, 2>
