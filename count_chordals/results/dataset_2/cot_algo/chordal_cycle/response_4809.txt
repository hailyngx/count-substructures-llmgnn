Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:  
- <5, 1, 0, 9>  
- <5, 1, 3, 7>  
- <5, 2, 9, 7>  
- <5, 4, 8, 0>  
- <5, 7, 3, 1>  
- <5, 7, 4, 8>  
- <9, 2, 3, 6>  
- <9, 4, 8, 6>  
- <9, 7, 4, 1>  
- <4, 1, 0, 8>  
- <4, 7, 3, 6>  
- <7, 5, 2, 9>  
- <7, 5, 1, 3>  
- <7, 9, 2, 6>  
- <7, 9, 1, 4>  
- <1, 5, 2, 3>  
- <1, 5, 4, 7>  
- <1, 9, 2, 6>  
- <3, 1, 0, 8>  
- <3, 7, 4, 1>  
- <8, 4, 1, 3>  
- <8, 6, 3, 7>  
- <2, 5, 4, 1>  
- <2, 9, 7, 6>  

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord, we find the unique chordal 4-cycle <5, (1, 4), 7> with the chord (1,4).

Step 3: As there is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
