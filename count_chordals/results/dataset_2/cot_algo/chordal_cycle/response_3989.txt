Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 14) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 12) (0, 7) (0, 9) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 1) (10, 15) (10, 16) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 9) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 13) (18, 19) (11, 19) (11, 2) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 16) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 3-15-14-4-3
- Cycle 2: 4-14-19-1-4
- Cycle 3: 4-5-6-12-4
- Cycle 4: 4-17-13-1-4
- Cycle 5: 7-0-9-13-7
- Cycle 6: 8-5-6-12-8
- Cycle 7: 10-15-14-19-10
- Cycle 8: 13-9-7-0-13
- Cycle 9: 14-19-18-14

Step 2: 
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (15, 4).
- Cycle 2 has a chord (14, 1).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (5, 12).
- Cycle 4 has a chord (17, 13).
- Cycle 5 has a chord (0, 9).
- Cycle 6 has a chord (5, 12).
- Cycle 7 has a chord (15, 19).
- Cycle 8 has a chord (9, 7).
- Cycle 9 has no chords.

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<3, 15, 4, 14> (15, 4)
<4, 14, 19, 1> (14, 1)
<4, 5, 6, 12> (5, 12)
<4, 17, 13, 1> (17, 13)
<7, 0, 9, 13> (0, 9)
<8, 5, 6, 12> (5, 12)
<10, 15, 14, 19> (15, 19)
<13, 9, 7, 0> (9, 7)
