Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-4-5-6
- Cycle 2: 6-1-4-5-6
- Cycle 3: 6-3-2-8-6
- Cycle 4: 6-0-2-8-6
- Cycle 5: 6-5-4-9-6
- Cycle 6: 6-1-7-9-6
- Cycle 7: 6-3-2-0-6
- Cycle 8: 6-2-0-7-6
- Cycle 9: 9-4-5-6-9
- Cycle 10: 9-1-6-5-9
- Cycle 11: 9-7-1-6-9
- Cycle 12: 9-0-6-1-9
- Cycle 13: 4-5-6-1-4
- Cycle 14: 4-9-6-1-4
- Cycle 15: 4-1-7-9-4
- Cycle 16: 8-2-6-0-8
- Cycle 17: 8-7-9-1-8
- Cycle 18: 5-4-9-6-5
- Cycle 19: 5-1-6-4-5
- Cycle 20: 5-3-6-2-5
- Cycle 21: 2-6-9-0-2
- Cycle 22: 2-8-7-9-2
- Cycle 23: 2-3-5-6-2
- Cycle 24: 2-0-6-9-2
- Cycle 25: 0-6-9-7-0
- Cycle 26: 0-2-8-7-0
- Cycle 27: 0-7-1-6-0
- Cycle 28: 7-9-4-1-7
- Cycle 29: 7-8-2-6-7
- Cycle 30: 7-0-6-1-7
- Cycle 31: 1-6-9-7-1
- Cycle 32: 1-9-4-5-1
- Cycle 33: 1-4-5-3-1
- Cycle 34: 1-5-6-4-1
- Cycle 35: 1-7-8-2-1
- Cycle 36: 3-6-5-4-3
- Cycle 37: 3-5-6-2-3

Step 2:
Out of the listed cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <6, (1, 4), 5, 9>
2. <6, (0, 2), 8, 3>
3. <6, (1, 7), 9, 4>
4. <6, (2, 8), 0, 3> 

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore, the final count is [4].
