Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 12) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 12) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 0) (14, 12) (14, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:

3. (2, 1, 6, 4)
4. (2, 1, 14, 12)
5. (2, 1, 14, 1)
6. (2, 1, 0, 5)
7. (2, 11, 13, 6)
8. (2, 11, 13, 12)
9. (2, 11, 13, 11)
10. (3, 10, 7, 4)
11. (3, 10, 0, 5)
12. (3, 11, 13, 6)
13. (3, 11, 13, 12)
14. (3, 9, 6, 4)
15. (3, 9, 7, 4)
16. (4, 7, 10, 3)
17. (4, 6, 1, 2)
18. (4, 6, 9, 3)
19. (4, 8, 9, 3)
20. (4, 10, 7, 2)
21. (5, 0, 1, 2)
22. (5, 9, 6, 4)
23. (5, 9, 7, 4)
24. (5, 11, 2, 7)
25. (5, 11, 13, 6)
26. (6, 1, 2, 7)
27. (6, 1, 14, 12)
28. (6, 9, 8, 4)
29. (6, 11, 2, 7)
30. (6, 13, 11, 2)
31. (7, 2, 1, 6)
32. (7, 9, 6, 4)
33. (7, 9, 8, 4)
34. (7, 10, 3, 9)
35. (8, 9, 6, 4)
36. (10, 3, 11, 5)
37. (10, 4, 6, 9)
38. (11, 2, 1, 0)
39. (11, 3, 10, 7)
40. (11, 5, 9, 6)
41. (11, 13, 6, 9)
42. (12, 5, 0, 1)
43. (12, 8, 9, 6)
44. (13, 6, 1, 2)
45. (13, 6, 9, 8)
46. (13, 11, 2, 1)
47. (13, 11, 12, 14)
48. (14, 1, 0, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, (6, 4), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles found is [47].
