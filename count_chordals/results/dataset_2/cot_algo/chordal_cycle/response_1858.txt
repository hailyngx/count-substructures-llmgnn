Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycles: 
  <1, (9, 13), 15)>
  <2, (0, 14), 11)>
  <3, (6, 7), 19)>
  <4, (16, 18), 6)>
  <5, (15, 9), 6)>
  <6, (14, 0), 11)>
  <7, (7, 19), 5)>
  <8, (3, 17), 12)>
  <9, (4, 8), 12)>
  <10, (8, 3), 17)>
  <11, (18, 16), 7)>
  <12, (13, 15), 9)>
  <13, (2, 0), 5)>
  <14, (5, 19), 7)>
  <15, (10, 0), 14)>
  <16, (15, 13), 12)>
