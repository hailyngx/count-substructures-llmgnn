Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (1, 0, 11, 5, 1)
- (1, 0, 11, 6, 2, 1)
- (1, 0, 8, 4, 2, 1)
- (1, 0, 8, 7, 2, 1)
- (1, 0, 8, 7, 13, 1)
- (1, 0, 8, 7, 14, 5, 1)
- (1, 0, 11, 3, 9, 13, 1)
- (1, 0, 11, 3, 9, 12, 13, 1)
- (1, 0, 11, 5, 2, 6, 10, 1)
- (1, 0, 11, 5, 2, 10, 1)
- (1, 0, 11, 3, 9, 12, 13, 7, 14, 5, 1)
- (1, 5, 2, 6, 10, 1)
  
Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, (2, 10), 5>
  
Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
