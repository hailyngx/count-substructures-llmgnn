Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 20) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 27) (22, 12) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 8) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 16) (17, 29) (17, 27) (4, 28) (7, 8) (10, 18) (11, 0) (11, 29) (11, 20) (6, 3) (6, 23) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 23) (8, 21) (23, 13) (23, 6) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 16) (29, 17) (29, 11) (29, 1) (29, 27) (1, 29) (1, 16) (1, 12) (26, 19) (26, 0) (19, 26) (19, 15) (19, 21) (19, 20) (19, 16) (16, 14) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 28) (28, 4) (28, 16) (3, 6) (3, 27) (21, 8) (21, 19) (21, 15) (25, 23) (25, 24) (15, 19) (15, 21) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 29) (27, 3) (27, 18) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 27) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 24) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 0) (0, 11) (0, 26) (0, 24) (2, 13) (2, 14) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 11) (20, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with every edge in the cycle:
- (13, 22, 14, 2, 13)
- (13, 22, 27, 29, 17, 27)
- (13, 23, 6, 3, 27, 13)
- (5, 9, 8, 23, 13, 20, 5)
- (14, 22, 27, 29, 1, 12, 14)
- (8, 9, 5, 20, 11, 29, 1, 12, 8)
- (23, 13, 22, 12, 24, 25, 23)
- (16, 1, 29, 17, 27, 3, 6, 23, 16)
- (16, 19, 21, 15, 19, 20, 11, 20, 16)
- (16, 28, 4, 28, 16)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <13, (14, 2), 22>
- <13, (27, 29), 22>
- <13, (6, 3), 23>
- <5, (8, 23), 9>
- <14, (27, 29), 22>
- <8, (5, 20), 9>
- <23, (12, 24), 13>
- <16, (1, 29), 17>
- <16, (15, 21), 19>
- <16, (4, 28), 16>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
