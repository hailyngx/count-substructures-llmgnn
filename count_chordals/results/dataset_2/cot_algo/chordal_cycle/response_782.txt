Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 9) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 11) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 4) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 14) (13, 11) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-2-11-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-11-1
- Cycle 3: 1-10-9-0-1
- Cycle 4: 3-7-12-9-3
- Cycle 5: 5-8-14-3-5
- Cycle 6: 5-12-9-0-5
- Cycle 7: 6-5-3-7-6
- Cycle 8: 6-12-9-4-6
- Cycle 9: 2-14-8-5-2
- Cycle 10: 8-9-12-7-8
- Cycle 11: 7-11-13-7
- Cycle 12: 4-11-7-9-4

Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, (4, 11), 1)> with the chord 4-11.

Step 3:
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
