Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 8) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 8) (5, 4) (19, 4) (19, 1) (1, 19) (1, 6) (1, 18) (1, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 8) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 18) (15, 0) (15, 9) (9, 2) (9, 15) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 19) (13, 10) (13, 16) (13, 18) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 7) (18, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (17, 14, 2, 4, 17)
- (17, 12, 16, 17)
- (17, 8, 11, 3, 7, 1, 18, 13, 16, 6, 10, 7)
- (17, 8, 11, 3, 7, 1, 18, 13, 10, 6, 16, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <17, (2, 4), 14>
- <17, (12, 16), 17>
- <17, (8, 11), 3, 7, 1, 18, 13, 16, 6, 10, 7>
- <17, (8, 11), 3, 7, 1, 18, 13, 10, 6, 16, 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
We found 4 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [4].
