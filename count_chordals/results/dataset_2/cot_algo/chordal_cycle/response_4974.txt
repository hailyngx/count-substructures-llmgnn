Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 14) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 9) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 0) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 17) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (15, 11) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 0) (12, 4) (6, 19) (6, 7) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 17) (17, 4) (17, 7) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 10) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1 - 3 - 16 - 11 - 1
- Cycle 2: 2 - 18 - 4 - 16 - 2
- Cycle 3: 2 - 15 - 11 - 16 - 2
- Cycle 4: 2 - 14 - 16 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 5: 2 - 14 - 4 - 18 - 2
- Cycle 6: 2 - 10 - 0 - 18 - 2
- Cycle 7: 2 - 10 - 19 - 13 - 2
- Cycle 8: 5 - 19 - 13 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 9: 5 - 19 - 10 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 10: 5 - 8 - 0 - 18 - 5
- Cycle 11: 8 - 0 - 10 - 19 - 8
- Cycle 12: 8 - 19 - 13 - 1 - 8
- Cycle 13: 12 - 4 - 16 - 11 - 12
- Cycle 14: 6 - 19 - 13 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 15: 6 - 7 - 9 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 16: 7 - 9 - 3 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 17: 7 - 17 - 4 - 16 - 7
- Cycle 18: 13 - 19 - 5 - 1 - 13
- Cycle 19: 14 - 16 - 4 - 17 - 14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (3, 16)
- Cycle 2 has chord (4, 16)
- Cycle 3 has chord (15, 11)
- Cycle 4 has chord (14, 16)
- Cycle 5 has chord (14, 18)
- Cycle 6 has chord (10, 0)
- Cycle 7 has chord (19, 13)
- Cycle 8 has chord (19, 13)
- Cycle 9 has chord (19, 10)
- Cycle 10 has chord (0, 18)
- Cycle 11 has chord (8, 0)
- Cycle 12 has chord (11, 16)
- Cycle 14 has chord (19, 13)
- Cycle 15 has chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 16 has chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 17 has chord (16, 4)
- Cycle 18 has chord (19, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [9].
Unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (3, 16), 11)>
<2, (4, 16), 18)>
<2, (15, 11), 2)>
<2, (14, 16), 4)>
<2, (14, 18), 2)>
<2, (10, 0), 18)>
<2, (19, 13), 10)>
<5, (0, 18), 5)>
<13, (19, 5), 1)>
