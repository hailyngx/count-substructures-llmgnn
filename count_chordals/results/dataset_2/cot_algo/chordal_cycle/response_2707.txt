Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 10) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles:
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 8, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 11, 7, 13, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 14, 1, 12, 9)
- Cycle 4: (1, 12, 11, 6, 1)
- Cycle 5: (4, 2, 8, 4)
- Cycle 6: (5, 13, 3, 14, 5)
- Cycle 7: (10, 0, 6, 12, 10)

Step 2:
List of chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (12, 14), 9, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (4, 8), 9, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (13, 7), 9, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <10, (0, 6), 12, 14>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
