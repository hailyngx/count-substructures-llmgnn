Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 15) (17, 18) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 7) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 19) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 19) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 6) (0, 3) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 16) (15, 17) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 14) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 16) (16, 3) (16, 6) (16, 1) (18, 11) (18, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: (4, 2, 13, 5, 14, 8, 2)  
- Cycle 2: (4, 2, 13, 7, 11, 14, 8, 2)  
- Cycle 3: (4, 2, 13, 15, 17, 11, 14, 8, 2)  
- Cycle 4: (4, 12, 3, 0, 16, 6, 7, 13, 2)  
- Cycle 5: (4, 12, 1, 16, 6, 7, 11, 14, 8, 2)  
- Cycle 6: (4, 19, 14, 11, 17, 15, 13, 7, 6, 2)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- Cycle 1 has no chords.  
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (11, 7).  
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (17, 15).  
- Cycle 4 has no chords.  
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (14, 11).  
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (14, 11).  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
There are 2 chordless cycles: Cycle 1 and Cycle 4.  
Thus, in this graph, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [2].  
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:  
- <1, (4, 2, 13, 5), 14, 8>  
- <2, 4, 12, (3, 0), 16, 6, 7, 13>
