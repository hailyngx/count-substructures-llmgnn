Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph:
1. Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 5
2. Cycle 2: 5 - 6 - 1 - 5
3. Cycle 3: 5 - 4 - 8 - 5
4. Cycle 4: 9 - 6 - 2 - 9
5. Cycle 5: 9 - 3 - 0 - 9
6. Cycle 6: 6 - 1 - 8 - 6
7. Cycle 7: 6 - 2 - 4 - 6
8. Cycle 8: 4 - 8 - 7 - 4
9. Cycle 9: 8 - 2 - 7 - 8
10. Cycle 10: 8 - 3 - 7 - 8
11. Cycle 11: 2 - 7 - 3 - 2
12. Cycle 12: 0 - 3 - 7 - 0
13. Cycle 13: 0 - 4 - 8 - 0
14. Cycle 14: 9 - 1 - 6 - 9
15. Cycle 15: 1 - 6 - 2 - 1
16. Cycle 16: 1 - 8 - 4 - 1
17. Cycle 17: 5 - 4 - 0 - 5
18. Cycle 18: 7 - 3 - 0 - 7
19. Cycle 19: 7 - 0 - 9 - 7
20. Cycle 20: 3 - 9 - 1 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
1. <5, 4, 8, 5> (Chord: (4, 8))
2. <9, 6, 2, 9> (Chord: (6, 2))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [18].
