Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 0) (26, 17) (5, 9) (5, 19) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 24) (18, 12) (22, 15) (22, 12) (8, 13) (8, 25) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 25) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 25) (11, 8) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 17) (0, 26) (0, 21) (0, 12) (20, 27) (28, 29) (28, 6) (29, 28) (29, 4) (2, 12) (2, 27) (6, 10) (6, 28) (6, 7) (4, 29) (4, 27) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 4) (27, 1) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 14) (19, 23) (1, 27) (1, 16) (1, 24) (12, 18) (12, 22) (12, 0) (12, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 14) (24, 18) (24, 11) (24, 1) (3, 8) (17, 26) (17, 11) (17, 23) (23, 18) (23, 19) (23, 17) (23, 14) (23, 25) (21, 26) (21, 0) (21, 19) (15, 9) (15, 22) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 23) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 13, 8) 
        - Cycle 2: (5, 19, 21, 0) 
        - Cycle 3: (5, 19, 14, 23) 
        - Cycle 4: (5, 9, 15, 22) 
        - Cycle 5: (9, 15, 22, 12) 
        - Cycle 6: (9, 13, 8, 25)
        - Cycle 7: (13, 8, 11, 24)
        - Cycle 8: (13, 25, 23, 17)
        
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has one chord (9, 8)
        - Cycle 2 has one chord (19, 0)
        - Cycle 3 has one chord (19, 14)
        - Cycle 4 has one chord (9, 22)
        - Cycle 5 has one chord (9, 12)
        - Cycle 6 has one chord (13, 8)
        - Cycle 7 has one chord (8, 24)
        - Cycle 8 has one chord (13, 23)
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        As shown above, all cycles have exactly one chord. Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
