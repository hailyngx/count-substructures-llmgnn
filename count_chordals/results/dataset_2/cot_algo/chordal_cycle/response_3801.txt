Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 7) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 19) (11, 8) (11, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 16) (5, 15) (5, 0) (19, 3) (6, 1) (6, 15) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 2) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 7) (9, 13) (9, 7) (18, 13) (18, 1) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1-15-5-0-1
- Cycle 2: 1-15-6-1
- Cycle 3: 2-10-3-11-2
- Cycle 4: 2-10-4-1-18-2
- Cycle 5: 2-7-17-14-8-16-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 1-15-5-0-1 has one chord: (5, 15)
    <1, (5, 15), 0>
- Cycle 2: 1-15-6-1 has one chord: (6, 15)
    <2, (6, 15), 1>
- Cycle 3: 2-10-3-11-2 has one chord: (3, 2)
    <3, (3, 2), 11>
- Cycle 4: 2-10-4-1-18-2 has one chord: (4, 18)
    <4, (4, 18), 1>
- Cycle 5: 2-7-17-14-8-16-2 has one chord: (14, 16)
    <5, (14, 16), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
