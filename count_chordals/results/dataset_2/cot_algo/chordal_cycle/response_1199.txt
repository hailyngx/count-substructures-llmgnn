Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-6-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-4-9-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-10-14-0
- Cycle 4: 0-3-6-13-0
- Cycle 5: 1-4-14-10-1
- Cycle 6: 2-3-6-5-2
- Cycle 7: 2-3-7-11-2
- Cycle 8: 4-9-12-11-4
- Cycle 9: 6-5-13-7-6
- Cycle 10: 7-10-14-4-7

Step 2:
Among these cycles, only Cycle 8: 4-9-12-11-4 has exactly one chord 9-11.

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, 9, 11, 12>.
