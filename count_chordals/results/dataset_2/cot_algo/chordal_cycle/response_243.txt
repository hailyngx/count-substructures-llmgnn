Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 11) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 7) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (3, 5) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 17) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 12) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (19, 4) (19, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 19) (13, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 3, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 11, 17, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 7, 3, 5)
- Cycle 4: (14, 17, 11, 9)
- Cycle 5: (14, 17, 18, 15, 14)
- Cycle 6: (14, 0, 10, 6, 14)
- Cycle 7: (17, 10, 6, 14, 17)
- Cycle 8: (17, 11, 9, 7, 17)
- Cycle 9: (10, 0, 14, 17, 10)
- Cycle 10: (10, 6, 14, 17, 10)
- Cycle 11: (10, 12, 3, 7, 10)
- Cycle 12: (4, 6, 10, 12, 4)
- Cycle 13: (8, 16, 17, 14, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 7, 3, 12, 8)
- Cycle 15: (18, 17, 11, 9, 18)
- Cycle 16: (18, 15, 0, 14, 18)
- Cycle 17: (18, 3, 7, 8, 18)
- Cycle 18: (0, 9, 11, 17, 0)
- Cycle 19: (0, 10, 6, 4, 0)
- Cycle 20: (0, 15, 18, 17, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- 1 chord: <1, (3, 7), 5)>
- 1 chord: <2, (9, 11), 17)>
- 1 chord: <3, (7, 9), 5)>
- 1 chord: <4, (14, 17), 9)>
- 1 chord: <5, (14, 17), 15)>
- 1 chord: <6, (0, 10), 14)>
- 1 chord: <7, (10, 6), 14)>
- 1 chord: <8, (11, 9), 17)>
- 1 chord: <9, (10, 0), 14)>
- 1 chord: <10, (10, 6), 14)>
- 1 chord: <11, (3, 7), 10)>
- 1 chord: <12, (6, 10), 4)>
- 1 chord: <13, (16, 17), 14)>
- 1 chord: <14, (3, 7), 12)>
- 1 chord: <15, (11, 9), 17)>
- 1 chord: <16, (15, 0), 18)>
- 1 chord: <17, (3, 7), 8)>
- 1 chord: <18, (9, 11), 17)>
- 1 chord: <19, (0, 10), 6)>
- 1 chord: <20, (0, 15), 18)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [20].
