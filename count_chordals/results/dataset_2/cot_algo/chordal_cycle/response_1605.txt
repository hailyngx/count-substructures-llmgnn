Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 3) (17, 16) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 15) (13, 6) (13, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 18) (16, 17) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 19) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 11) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 18) (4, 1) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 1, 7)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 13, 6)
- Cycle 3: (3, 14, 12, 0)
- Cycle 4: (3, 18, 7, 11)
- Cycle 5: (15, 13, 6, 19)
- Cycle 6: (15, 1, 7, 18)
- Cycle 7: (17, 16, 18, 11)
  
Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge):
- <1, (3, 15), 7>  (Chord: (3, 15))
- <1, 7, 18> (Chord: 7)
- <3, 15, 13> (Chord: 15)
- <3, (14, 12), 0> (Chord: (14, 12))
- <3, 18, 7> (Chord: 18)
- <13, 6, (15, 19)> (Chord: (15, 19))
- <16, 17, 11> (Chord: 17)

Step 3: Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
As we have found 7 unique chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [7].
