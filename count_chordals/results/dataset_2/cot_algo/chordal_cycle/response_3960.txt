Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (5, 3, 1, 4, 5)
- (5, 3, 7, 10, 5)
- (9, 6, 14, 13, 9)
- (6, 14, 12, 11, 6)
- (1, 3, 7, 0, 1)
- (1, 8, 0, 3, 1)
- (3, 5, 10, 7, 3)
- (0, 1, 4, 6, 0)
- (0, 7, 10, 11, 0)
- (14, 6, 4, 12, 14)
- (13, 9, 5, 12, 13)
- (7, 1, 3, 0, 7)
- (4, 6, 8, 0, 4)
- (4, 13, 2, 6, 4)
- (12, 14, 13, 9, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <5, (3, 10), 7, (1, 4), 5>
- <9, (6, 14), 13, (4, 12), 9>
- <6, (14, 2), 4, (12, 11), 6>
- <1, (3, 7), 0, (8, 4), 1>
- <3, (5, 10), 7, (1, 4), 3>
- <0, (1, 4), 6, (8, 4), 0>
- <14, (6, 13), 9, (12, 5), 14>
- <13, (9, 5), 12, (14, 4), 13>
- <7, (1, 3), 0, (10, 11), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
We found 9 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [9].
