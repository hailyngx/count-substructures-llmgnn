Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <6, 9, 4, 6>
- Cycle <6, 9, 3, 4, 6>
- Cycle <6, 9, 7, 5, 6>
- Cycle <6, 0, 4, 6>
- Cycle <6, 0, 8, 6>
- Cycle <9, 1, 3, 9>
- Cycle <9, 1, 7, 5, 9>
- Cycle <9, 3, 4, 9>
- Cycle <9, 3, 10, 7, 9>
- Cycle <1, 7, 5, 6, 1>
- Cycle <1, 7, 10, 3, 1>
- Cycle <3, 10, 7, 5, 3>
- Cycle <10, 11, 13, 10>
- Cycle <5, 7, 14, 13, 5>
- Cycle <0, 8, 14, 13, 0>
- Cycle <14, 2, 8, 0, 14>
- Cycle <2, 7, 5, 6, 2>
- Cycle <4, 13, 2, 8, 4>
- Cycle <12, 1, 7, 5, 12>

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, 9, 4, 6> with chord (9, 4)

Step 3:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle found, so the count is [1]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <6, 9, 4, 6> with chord (9, 4) as the chord inside ().
