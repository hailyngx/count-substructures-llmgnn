Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 6, 5) 
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 2, 1, 5) 
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 3, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 6, 8, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 8, 4, 2, 5)
- Cycle 6: (9, 6, 1, 2, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 1, 4, 6, 9)
- Cycle 8: (6, 1, 0, 4, 6)
- Cycle 9: (1, 2, 7, 4, 1)
- Cycle 10: (3, 7, 0, 5, 3)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (1, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final answer is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (1, 6), 6)>
<5, (1, 9), 9)>
<5, (6, 8), 8)>
<5, (4, 8), 8)>
<9, (1, 2), 2)>
<9, (1, 6), 6)>
<6, (1, 4), 4)>
<1, (1, 2), 2)>
