Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 19) (6, 4) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 5) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 19) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 19) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 15) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 2-9-11-12-2
- Cycle 2: 10-13-14-4-10
- Cycle 3: 4-17-2-1-4
- Cycle 4: 1-18-15-14-1
- Cycle 5: 12-1-2-9-12
- Cycle 6: 8-0-12-1-8

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for a chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord
- Cycle 2 has no chord
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has no chord
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (0, 15)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, 15, 1, 8>
