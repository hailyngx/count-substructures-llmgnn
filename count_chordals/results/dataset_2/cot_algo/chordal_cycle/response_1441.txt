Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 4, 1, 9, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 4, 1, 3, 7, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 4, 8, 7, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 0, 6, 2, 3, 1, 9, 5>
- Cycle 5: <9, 1, 4, 5, 0, 6, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 1, 7, 8, 4, 5, 0, 6, 2, 3, 9>
- Cycle 7: <6, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 0, 6>
- Cycle 8: <1, 7, 8, 4, 5, 0, 6, 2, 3, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has one chord: <5, (1, 9), 4, 5>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: <5, (1, 3), 7, 5>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: <5, (4, 8), 7, 5>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: <5, (0, 6), 2, 3, 1, 9, 5>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: <9, (1, 7), 8, 4, 5, 0, 6, 2, 3, 9>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: <9, (1, 7), 8, 4, 5, 0, 6, 2, 3, 9>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: <6, (2, 3), 1, 4, 5, 0, 6>
- Cycle 8 has one chord: <1, (7, 8), 4, 5, 0, 6, 2, 3, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [8].
