Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-4-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-7-0
- Cycle 4: 0-4-2-8-0
- Cycle 5: 0-4-6-3-9-0
- Cycle 6: 1-4-6-3-1
- Cycle 7: 1-4-8-2-1
- Cycle 8: 1-7-9-0-1
- Cycle 9: 1-7-0-8-2-4-1
- Cycle 10: 3-6-1-4-3
- Cycle 11: 3-6-4-2-8-0-3
- Cycle 12: 4-2-5-8-4
- Cycle 13: 5-8-0-7-5
- Cycle 14: 6-4-1-7-6
- Cycle 15: 6-4-8-0-7-6
- Cycle 16: 8-0-9-7-8

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, (1, 4), 6, 2, 0>
- <0, (1, 7), 8, 2, 0>
- <1, (4, 6), 3, 1>
- <1, (4, 8), 2, 1>
- <1, (7, 9), 0, 1>
- <1, (7, 0), 8, 2, 4, 1>
- <3, (6, 4), 2, 8, 0, 3>
- <4, (2, 5), 8, 4>
- <5, (8, 0), 7, 5>
- <6, (4, 1), 7, 6>
- <6, (4, 8), 0, 7, 6>
- <8, (0, 9), 7, 8>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
