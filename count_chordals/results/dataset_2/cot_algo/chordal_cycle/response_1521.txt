Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 24) (5, 16) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 22) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 0) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 27) (10, 7) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 24) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 25) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 29) (26, 16) (28, 26) (28, 3) (1, 4) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 27) (22, 6) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 25) (16, 5) (16, 26) (16, 21) (16, 12) (16, 14) (21, 13) (21, 16) (21, 20) (3, 10) (3, 28) (3, 27) (12, 9) (12, 16) (12, 19) (12, 23) (11, 24) (11, 18) (11, 4) (24, 5) (24, 17) (24, 11) (24, 19) (7, 8) (7, 10) (14, 16) (27, 10) (27, 2) (27, 29) (27, 3) (18, 11) (18, 25) (23, 12) (20, 26) (20, 22) (20, 21) (25, 2) (25, 22) (25, 18) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 19) (19, 12) (19, 24) (19, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 17, 10, 8, 2, 22, 6, 9, 13, 21, 16, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 17, 24, 11, 18, 25, 2, 8, 10, 17)
- Cycle 3: (9, 13, 8, 2, 22, 6, 9)
- Cycle 4: (10, 17, 24, 19, 0, 22, 2, 8, 10)
- Cycle 5: (26, 28, 3, 27, 29, 26)
- Cycle 6: (16, 21, 20, 26, 29, 27, 3, 28, 26)
- Cycle 7: (12, 19, 0, 13, 8, 10, 17, 24, 11, 4, 1, 12)
- Cycle 8: (22, 25, 18, 11, 4, 1, 22)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges):
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (8, 2)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (24, 19)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (27, 3)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (26, 29)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (0, 13)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (25, 18)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, the number is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <9, 6, 22, 25>
