Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 0) (15, 23) (15, 21) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (21, 15) (21, 18) (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 22) (16, 11) (16, 24) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 25) (3, 13) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 23) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 5) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 28) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 28) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 9) (6, 28) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 6) (28, 5) (4, 27) (4, 3) (4, 2) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 24) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 26) (18, 20) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 0) (9, 10) (9, 29) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 26) (19, 22) (19, 14) (19, 24) (24, 16) (24, 25) (24, 19) (20, 12) (20, 18) (20, 2) (2, 4) (2, 20) (23, 15) (23, 10) (0, 22) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 26) (14, 13) (14, 27) (14, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (13, 3, 1, 7, 12, 20, 2, 4, 27, 14, 19, 24, 25, 0, 22, 16) (16 edges)
        - Cycle 2: (15, 21, 18, 26, 5, 8, 13, 3, 27, 14, 19, 24, 25, 0, 22, 16) (16 edges)
        - Cycle 3: (11, 18, 26, 5, 8, 13, 3, 27, 4, 2, 20, 12, 7, 1, 21, 15) (16 edges)
        - Cycle 4: (17, 29, 9, 10, 23, 15, 21, 18, 11, 16, 24, 25, 0, 22, 16) (15 edges)
        - Cycle 5: (17, 29, 9, 10, 3, 4, 27, 14, 19, 24, 16, 22, 0, 25, 8, 5) (15 edges)
        - Cycle 6: (17, 29, 7, 1, 3, 27, 14, 19, 24, 16, 22, 0, 25, 8, 5) (15 edges)
        - Cycle 7: (17, 29, 7, 1, 21, 15, 23, 10, 9, 29, 5, 8, 13, 3, 27, 4) (15 edges)
        - Cycle 8: (17, 5, 8, 13, 3, 27, 4, 2, 20, 12, 7, 1, 21, 15, 23, 10) (15 edges)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, (3, 27), 3, (27, 4), 27, (4, 2), 4>
        - <21, (15, 23), 15, (23, 10), 23, (10, 9), 10>
        - <21, (15, 23), 15, (23, 10), 23, (10, 9), 29>
        - <21, (15, 23), 15, (23, 10), 23, (10, 9), 5>
        - <21, (15, 23), 15, (23, 10), 9, (29, 5), 29>
        - <21, (15, 23), 15, (23, 10), 9, (29, 5), 5>
        - <21, (15, 23), 23, (10, 9), 29, (5, 8), 5>
        - <18, (26, 5), 26, (5, 8), 5, (8, 13), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        - <1, (3, 27), 3, (27, 4), 27, (4, 2), 4>
        - <21, (15, 23), 15, (23, 10), 23, (10, 9), 10>
        - <21, (15, 23), 15, (23, 10), 23, (10, 9), 29>
        - <21, (15, 23), 15, (23, 10), 23, (10, 9), 5>
        - <21, (15, 23), 15, (23, 10), 9, (29, 5), 29>
        - <21, (15, 23), 15, (23, 10), 9, (29, 5), 5>
        - <21, (15, 23), 23, (10, 9), 29, (5, 8), 5>
        - <18, (26, 5), 26, (5, 8), 5, (8, 13), 8>
