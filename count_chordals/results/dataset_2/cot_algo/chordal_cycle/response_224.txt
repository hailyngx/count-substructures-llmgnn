Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- The cycles of length 4 or more are:
  - Cycle 1: 0-2-1-6-0
  - Cycle 2: 2-9-6-5-2
  - Cycle 3: 3-4-7-9-3
  - Cycle 4: 4-7-5-6-4
  - Cycle 5: 5-7-4-3-5
  - Cycle 6: 6-1-0-4-6
  - Cycle 7: 7-8-5-6-7
  - Cycle 8: 9-7-4-0-9
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The cycles with exactly one chord are:
  - <0, (1, 6), 2, 0>
  - <2, (6, 5), 9, 2>
  - <3, (4, 7), 9, 3>
  - <4, (5, 6), 7, 4>
  - <5, (4, 7), 3, 5>
  - <6, (1, 2), 0, 6>
  - <7, (5, 6), 4, 7>
  - <9, (4, 0), 7, 9>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0] as all the cycles found have exactly one chord.
