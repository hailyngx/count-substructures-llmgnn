Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 24) (3, 25) (3, 20) (25, 3) (25, 13) (25, 6) (25, 8) (25, 11) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 1) (21, 10) (21, 4) (21, 18) (21, 29) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 9) (18, 21) (18, 2) (18, 17) (20, 15) (20, 3) (20, 17) (20, 24) (6, 25) (6, 28) (28, 6) (28, 19) (17, 18) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 22) (16, 17) (16, 24) (16, 8) (8, 25) (8, 16) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (11, 25) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 29) (23, 5) (23, 1) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 29) (22, 2) (22, 17) (22, 14) (26, 10) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 16) (24, 19) (29, 7) (29, 21) (29, 11) (29, 10) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 11) (19, 24) (19, 13) (5, 11) (5, 23) (14, 22) (12, 15) (13, 15) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 1) (0, 17) (0, 9) (0, 1) (4, 21) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 23) (1, 13) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 15 - 20 - 3 - 25 - 15
- Cycle 2: 15 - 24 - 16 - 8 - 25 - 3 - 20 - 15
- Cycle 3: 15 - 24 - 19 - 7 - 29 - 21 - 10 - 26 - 22 - 2 - 18 - 17 - 20 - 15
- Cycle 4: 15 - 24 - 19 - 28 - 6 - 25 - 11 - 29 - 21 - 4 - 18 - 2 - 9 - 1 - 7 - 29 - 10 - 26 - 22 - 17 - 16 - 24

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 15 - 20 - 3 - 25 - 15 has exactly one chord 3 - 25
- Cycle 2: 15 - 24 - 16 - 8 - 25 - 3 - 20 - 15 has exactly one chord 16 - 25
- Cycle 3: 15 - 24 - 19 - 7 - 29 - 21 - 10 - 26 - 22 - 2 - 18 - 17 - 20 - 15 has exactly one chord 7 - 21
- Cycle 4: 15 - 24 - 19 - 28 - 6 - 25 - 11 - 29 - 21 - 4 - 18 - 2 - 9 - 1 - 7 - 29 - 10 - 26 - 22 - 17 - 16 - 24 has exactly one chord 6 - 11

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [0] chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<15, 20, 3, 25, (3, 25)>
<15, 24, 16, 8, 25, 3, 20, (16, 25)>
<15, 24, 19, 7, 29, 21, 10, 26, 22, 2, 18, 17, 20, (7, 21)>
<15, 24, 19, 28, 6, 25, 11, 29, 21, 4, 18, 2, 9, 1, 7, 29, 10, 26, 22, 17, 16, (6, 11)>
