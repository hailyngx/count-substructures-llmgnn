        - Cycle 1: 11 -> 14 -> 3 -> 17 -> 11
        - Cycle 2: 11 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 12 -> 11
        - Cycle 3: 11 -> 0 -> 1 -> 16 -> 11
        - Cycle 4: 16 -> 18 -> 2 -> 13 -> 16
        - Cycle 5: 16 -> 19 -> 7 -> 6 -> 18 -> 16
        - Cycle 6: 16 -> 1 -> 0 -> 11 -> 14 -> 16
        - Cycle 7: 3 -> 14 -> 0 -> 1 -> 16 -> 3

        - Cycle 25: 6 -> 5 -> 9 -> 13 -> 2 -> 6
        - Cycle 26: 6 -> 18 -> 17 -> 3 -> 8 -> 6
        - Cycle 27: 6 -> 19 -> 16 -> 1 -> 0 -> 6
        - Cycle 28: 0 -> 11 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 0
        - Cycle 29: 0 -> 1 -> 16 -> 19 -> 6 -> 0
        - Cycle 30: 14 -> 11 -> 0 -> 1 -> 16 -> 14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <11, 14, 3, 17> has chord (14, 17)
        - <11, 2, 7, 4, 12> has chord (7, 12)
        - <11, 0, 1, 16> has chord (0, 16)
        - <16, 18, 2, 13> has chord (18, 13)
        - <16, 19, 7, 6, 18> has chord (19, 6)
        - <16, 1, 0, 11, 14> has chord (1, 14)
        - <3, 14, 0, 1, 16> has chord (14, 1)
        - <3, 8, 17, 9, 5> has chord (8, 9)
        - <3, 17, 18, 6, 5> has chord (17, 6)
        - <15, 8, 17, 18, 6> has chord (8, 18)
        - <15, 12, 5, 9, 17> has chord (12, 9)
        - <5, 10, 12, 4, 7> has chord (10, 7)
        - <5, 9, 13, 2, 11> has chord (9, 11)
        - <9, 17, 18, 6, 19> has chord (17, 19)
        - <7, 4, 12, 5, 6> has chord (4, 6)
        - <7, 6, 18, 17, 8> has chord (6, 17)
        - <7, 19, 16, 1, 0> has chord (19, 1)
        - <7, 2, 11, 14, 3> has chord (2, 14)
        - <2, 11, 14, 3, 8> has chord (11, 8)
        - <2, 18, 17, 8, 15> has chord (18, 15)
        - <2, 13, 9, 17, 3> has chord (13, 3)
        - <18, 6, 5, 10, 12> has chord (6, 10)
        - <6, 5, 9, 13, 2> has chord (5, 13)
        - <6, 18, 17, 3, 8> has chord (18, 8)
        - <6, 19, 16, 1, 0> has chord (19, 1)
        - <0, 11, 2, 7, 4> has chord (11, 4)
        - <0, 1, 16, 19, 6> has chord (1, 19)
        - <14, 11, 0, 1, 16> has chord (11, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 28 chordal 4-cycles found.
        Therefore, the final number of chordless cycles is [2].
