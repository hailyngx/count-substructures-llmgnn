Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (6, 5, 1, 2)
- Cycle 2: (6, 11, 0, 1)
- Cycle 3: (6, 13, 0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (6, 14, 13, 0)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 5, 1)
- Cycle 6: (9, 8, 4, 0)
- Cycle 7: (1, 0, 4, 9)
- Cycle 8: (3, 7, 4, 0)
- Cycle 9: (4, 9, 13, 0)
- Cycle 10: (7, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 11: (7, 4, 8, 11)
- Cycle 12: (10, 7, 3, 5)
- Cycle 13: (11, 6, 5, 1)
- Cycle 14: (11, 10, 7, 3)
- Cycle 15: (8, 9, 4, 0)
- Cycle 16: (5, 6, 11, 0)
- Cycle 17: (2, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 18: (2, 11, 6, 5)
- Cycle 19: (12, 4, 0, 1)

Step 2:
- <1, (6, 5, 1, 2)>
- <2, (6, 11, 0, 1)>
- <3, (6, 13, 0, 1)>
- <4, (6, 14, 13, 0)>
- <5, (9, 6, 5, 1)>
- <6, (9, 8, 4, 0)>
- <7, (1, 0, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 4, 0)>
- <9, (4, 9, 13, 0)>
- <10, (7, 3, 5, 1)>
- <11, (7, 4, 8, 11)>
- <12, (10, 7, 3, 5)>
- <13, (11, 6, 5, 1)>
- <14, (11, 10, 7, 3)>
- <15, (8, 9, 4, 0)>
- <16, (5, 6, 11, 0)>
- <17, (2, 1, 0, 7)>
- <18, (2, 11, 6, 5)>
- <19, (12, 4, 0, 1)>

Step 3:
There are 19 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the answer is [19].
