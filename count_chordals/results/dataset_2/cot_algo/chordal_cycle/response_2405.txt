Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 13) (14, 17) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 7) (1, 21) (1, 25) (1, 16) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 11) (18, 19) (18, 24) (18, 25) (22, 27) (22, 20) (22, 8) (10, 0) (10, 28) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 2) (20, 5) (20, 22) (20, 0) (20, 23) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (19, 18) (19, 11) (26, 27) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 16) (15, 24) (7, 17) (7, 1) (7, 2) (11, 21) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 4) (27, 22) (27, 26) (27, 29) (27, 16) (29, 14) (29, 27) (29, 23) (29, 3) (3, 2) (3, 29) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 8) (24, 18) (24, 15) (24, 3) (24, 8) (8, 22) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 12) (25, 1) (25, 18) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 27) (16, 23) (28, 10) (28, 12) (12, 21) (12, 8) (12, 28) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 23) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 3) (23, 16) (23, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
<0, 10, 28, 12>
<0, 2, 7, 1>
<0, 20, 5, 4>
<0, 20, 22, 27>
<1, 7, 2, 11>
<1, 7, 17, 14>
<2, 11, 19, 18>
<2, 3, 29, 27>
<3, 8, 24, 18>
<3, 23, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 20, 23>
<4, 11, 19, 18>
<4, 23, 20, 0>
<5, 4, 11, 19>
<5, 20, 23, 3>
<6, 13, 9, 5>
<7, 2, 0, 10>
<7, 17, 14, 29>
<8, 22, 27, 26>
<8, 24, 18, 19>
<9, 5, 20, 0>
<10, 0, 2, 7>
<11, 19, 18, 25>
<12, 21, 1, 7>
<13, 9, 5, 20>
<14, 17, 7, 1>
<15, 24, 18, 25>
<16, 27, 26, 22>
<16, 23, 3, 2>
<17, 7, 2, 11>
<18, 19, 11, 21>
<23, 20, 5, 9>
<26, 27, 22, 20>
<27, 22, 20, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<0, 10, 28, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 32 chordless cycles found.

Final Answer: [32]
