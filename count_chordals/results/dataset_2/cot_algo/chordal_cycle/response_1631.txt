Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 9) (13, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 5) 

Response:
Step 1:  
       The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
        - (6, 10, 0, 4)
        - (6, 10, 2, 7)
        - (6, 4, 0, 10)
        - (9, 14, 6, 10)
        - (9, 14, 8, 0)
        - (9, 8, 3, 7)
        - (1, 3, 8, 0)
        - (1, 5, 2, 7)
        - (1, 10, 0, 4)
        - (3, 7, 2, 5)
        - (3, 8, 0, 10)
        - (7, 12, 6, 4)
        - (12, 13, 9, 14)
        - (12, 11, 14, 5)
        - (2, 5, 4, 0)
        - (2, 10, 1, 5)
        - (8, 14, 11, 5)
        - (0, 4, 10, 6)

Step 2:
        Checking for chords in each of the cycles:
        - (6, 10, 0, 4) has a chord: (6, 0)
        - (6, 10, 2, 7) has a chord: (6, 7)
        - (6, 4, 0, 10) has a chord: (6, 10)
        - (9, 14, 6, 10) has a chord: (9, 6)
        - (9, 14, 8, 0) has a chord: (9, 8)
        - (9, 8, 3, 7) has a chord: (9, 3)
        - No chord found in (1, 3, 8, 0)
        - (1, 5, 2, 7) has a chord: (1, 7)
        - (1, 10, 0, 4) has a chord: (1, 4)
        - (3, 7, 2, 5) has a chord: (3, 5)
        - No chord found in (3, 8, 0, 10)
        - (7, 12, 6, 4) has a chord: (7, 6)
        - (12, 13, 9, 14) has a chord: (12, 9)
        - (12, 11, 14, 5) has a chord: (12, 5)
        - No chord found in (2, 5, 4, 0)
        - (2, 10, 1, 5) has a chord: (2, 1)
        - (8, 14, 11, 5) has a chord: (8, 11)
        - (0, 4, 10, 6) has a chord: (0, 10)

Step 3:
        Count of chordal 4-cycles: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <6, (10, 0), 4>
        <6, (10, 2), 7>
        <6, (4, 0), 10>
        <9, (14, 6), 10>
        <9, (14, 8), 0>
        <9, (8, 3), 7>
        <1, (5, 2), 7>
        <1, (10, 0), 4>
        <7, (12, 6), 4>
