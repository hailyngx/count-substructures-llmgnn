Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (17, 5) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 19) (18, 15) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 1) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 6) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 2) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 12) (9, 11) (1, 16) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 16, 7, 2, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 16, 7, 10, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 16, 7, 2, 3, 0, 6, 15, 10, 7, 2, 4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 16, 7, 10, 15, 6, 0, 3, 12, 5, 1)

Step 2: Checking for chord in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (4,2)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (16,10)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (10,6) and (15,4)
- Cycle 4 does not have any chords

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are [3] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 16, 7, 2> with non-adjacent chords (4,2)
<1, 16, 7, 10> with non-adjacent chord (16,10)
<1, 16, 7, 2, 3, 0, 6, 15> with non-adjacent chords (10,6) and (15,4)
