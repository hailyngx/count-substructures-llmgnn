Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles with length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-6-13-0
- Cycle 2: 1-3-7-4-1
- Cycle 3: 2-3-7-12-2
- Cycle 4: 2-9-3-6-2
- Cycle 5: 5-8-11-6-5
- Cycle 6: 10-1-7-4-10
- Cycle 7: 13-6-11-9-13

Step 2: Check for a chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord: <0, 6>
- Cycle 2 has chord: <1, 4>
- Cycle 3 has chord: <2, 7>
- Cycle 4 has chord: <3, 6>
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has chord: <1, 10>
- Cycle 7 has chord: <6, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <5, 11, 8, 6>
