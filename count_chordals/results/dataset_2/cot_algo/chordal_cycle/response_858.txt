Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 10) (14, 6) (14, 2) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 1) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 1 - 0 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 4 - 2 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 14 - 2 - 4 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 3 - 7 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 5: 9 - 1 - 2 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 6: 4 - 8 - 11 - 2 - 4
- Cycle 7: 8 - 11 - 12 - 10 - 8
- Cycle 8: 7 - 12 - 11 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 9: 12 - 6 - 0 - 5 - 12
- Cycle 10: 3 - 7 - 12 - 11 - 3
- Cycle 11: 11 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 11
- Cycle 12: 5 - 7 - 3 - 13 - 5
- Cycle 13: 13 - 3 - 6 - 0 - 13
- Cycle 14: 14 - 6 - 0 - 1 - 14

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (6, 1)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (14, 4)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (8, 2)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (11, 12)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (2, 12)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (6, 5)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (7, 12)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (11, 4)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (7, 3)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (13, 6)
- Cycle 14 has a chord: (1, 0)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Hence, there are no chordless 4-cycles in this graph.
