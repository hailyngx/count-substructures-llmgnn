Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 19) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 14) (4, 17) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 15) (2, 16) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 15) (15, 6) (15, 7) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 3) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 18) (12, 16) (12, 14) (9, 18) (9, 14) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 17) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists (chordless cycles):
<11, 16, 13, 10>, <4, 17, 6, 15>, <4, 17, 3, 14>, <5, 6, 15, 7>, <5, 6, 17, 3>, <5, 2, 8, 11>, <5, 2, 16, 13>, <5, 2, 8, 13>, <5, 0, 18, 19>, <5, 0, 18, 9>, <5, 0, 18, 19>, <6, 5, 0, 18>, <6, 17, 3, 4>, <6, 17, 4, 3>, <6, 17, 4, 3>, <6, 15, 7, 10>, <6, 15, 7, 10>, <7, 13, 16, 2>, <7, 13, 16, 11>, <7, 13, 8, 2>, <7, 10, 14, 3>, <7, 10, 14, 3>, <10, 13, 16, 2>, <10, 13, 16, 11>, <10, 13, 8, 2>, <10, 14, 1, 3>, <10, 14, 1, 3>, <14, 12, 16, 2>, <14, 12, 16, 11>, <14, 12, 2, 5>, <14, 3, 17, 4>, <14, 3, 17, 6>, <14, 3, 4, 17>, <14, 9, 18, 0>, <14, 9, 18, 5>, <14, 9, 18, 0>, <17, 4, 3, 14>, <18, 9, 14, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <11, 16, 13, 10>, chord: (11, 13)
- <5, 2, 8, 11>, chord: (2, 11)
- <5, 0, 18, 19>, chord: (0, 19)
- <6, 17, 3, 4>, chord: (17, 4)
- <7, 13, 16, 2>, chord: (13, 16)
- <10, 14, 1, 3>, chord: (14, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [34]
