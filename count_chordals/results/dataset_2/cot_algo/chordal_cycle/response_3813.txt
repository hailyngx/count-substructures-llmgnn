Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 2) (12, 4) (12, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (4, 6, 13, 12, 4)
- (4, 6, 9, 7, 4)
- (7, 10, 14, 2, 7)
- (1, 2, 14, 10, 1)
- (1, 3, 13, 6, 1)
- (3, 2, 14, 10, 3)
- (3, 8, 11, 5, 3)
- (10, 7, 4, 6, 10)
- (11, 8, 3, 1, 11)
- (6, 9, 1, 3, 6)
- (9, 7, 4, 12, 9)
- (8, 13, 5, 11, 8)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- In cycle (4, 6, 13, 12, 4), <4, (6, 12), 13> is a chordal 4-cycle.
- In cycle (4, 6, 9, 7, 4), <4, (6, 9), 7> is a chordal 4-cycle.
- In cycle (9, 6, 1, 3, 9), <9, (6, 1), 3> is a chordal 4-cycle.
- In cycle (8, 13, 5, 11, 8), <8, (13, 5), 11> is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0]. 

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
