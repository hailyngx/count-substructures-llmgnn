Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
   - The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
        <6, 9, 1, 7, 6>
        <6, 2, 1, 7, 6>
        <6, 8, 1, 7, 6>
        <6, 4, 8, 5, 6>
        <9, 1, 2, 8, 9>
        <9, 7, 1, 2, 9>
        <1, 3, 5, 7, 1>
        <1, 7, 5, 3, 1>
        <3, 5, 8, 4, 3>
        <4, 5, 8, 2, 4>
        <8, 5, 7, 6, 8>
        <5, 7, 6, 4, 5>

Step 2:
   - Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        <6, 9, 1, 7, 6> - Chord: (6, 1)  
        <6, 2, 1, 7, 6> - Chord: (6, 1) 
        <6, 8, 1, 7, 6> - Chord: (6, 1)  
        <6, 4, 8, 5, 6> - Chord: (6, 8)  
        <9, 1, 2, 8, 9> - Chord: (9, 2)  
        <9, 7, 1, 2, 9> - Chord: (9, 1)  
        <1, 3, 5, 7, 1> - Chord: (1, 5)  
        <1, 7, 5, 3, 1> - Chord: (1, 5)  
        <3, 5, 8, 4, 3> - Chord: (3, 8)  
        <4, 5, 8, 2, 4> - Chord: (4, 8)  
        <8, 5, 7, 6, 8> - Chord: (8, 7)  
        <5, 7, 6, 4, 5> - Chord: (5, 6)  

Step 3:
   - Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]
