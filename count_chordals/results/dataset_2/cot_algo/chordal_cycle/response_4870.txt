Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle of length 4: 6-9-0-8-6
- Cycle of length 4: 6-2-4-5-6
- Cycle of length 4: 6-2-0-8-6
- Cycle of length 5: 6-2-4-1-7-6  (not considered since it has length greater than 4)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 6-9-0-8-6 has a chord (9, 8)
- Cycle 6-2-4-5-6 has a chord (4, 5)
- Cycle 6-2-0-8-6 has a chord (2, 8)

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (9, 8), 0, 8>
                                <6, (4, 5), 2, 8>
