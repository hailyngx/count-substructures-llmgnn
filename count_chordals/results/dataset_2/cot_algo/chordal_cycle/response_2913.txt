Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 12) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 15) (17, 8) (17, 22) (29, 15) (29, 14) (21, 4) (21, 24) (28, 0) (28, 24) (26, 24) (26, 27) (24, 21) (24, 28) (24, 26) (2, 22) (2, 12) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 27) (12, 8) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 15) (12, 3) (23, 10) (23, 5) (23, 3) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 19) (1, 5) (1, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 0) (3, 13) (3, 20) (3, 12) (3, 23) (3, 14) (14, 29) (14, 3) (14, 18) (0, 28) (0, 19) (15, 6) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 27) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 9) (27, 16) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 1) (18, 14) (16, 20) (16, 9) (16, 27) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, shown below:

<1, (5, 23), 18, 19)>
<2, (12, 25), 3, 13)>
<4, (19, 0), 28, 24)>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].
