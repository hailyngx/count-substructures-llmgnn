Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 9, 2, 5)
- (5, 4, 7, 5)
- (9, 3, 7, 9)
- (9, 8, 4, 9)
- (4, 1, 8, 4)
- (4, 6, 2, 4)
- (7, 3, 0, 7)
- (3, 2, 6, 3)
- (8, 1, 4, 8)
- (8, 6, 2, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (4, 8), 6>
- <3, (2, 6), 9>
- <5, (2, 9), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [3].
