Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 8 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 11 - 1 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 10 - 4 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 6 - 14 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 8 - 4 - 10 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 11 - 6 - 7 - 9
- Cycle 7: 9 - 14 - 1 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 8: 1 - 8 - 9 - 14 - 1
- Cycle 9: 1 - 4 - 10 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 10: 4 - 8 - 9 - 12 - 4
- Cycle 11: 4 - 10 - 7 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 12: 8 - 1 - 14 - 6 - 8
- Cycle 13: 8 - 4 - 10 - 7 - 8
- Cycle 14: 8 - 11 - 6 - 14 - 8
- Cycle 15: 6 - 14 - 9 - 12 - 6
- Cycle 16: 6 - 11 - 7 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 17: 6 - 7 - 2 - 0 - 6
- Cycle 18: 6 - 13 - 7 - 12 - 6
- Cycle 19: 11 - 6 - 14 - 0 - 11
- Cycle 20: 11 - 9 - 14 - 0 - 11
- Cycle 21: 11 - 13 - 7 - 6 - 11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has a chord: (9, 1)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (11, 4)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (10, 8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (14, 0)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (8, 10)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (11, 6)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (1, 14)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (9, 14)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (4, 10)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (8, 9)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (4, 10)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (1, 14)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (4, 10)
- Cycle 14 has a chord: (8, 11)
- Cycle 15 has a chord: (14, 6)
- Cycle 16 has a chord: (11, 7)
- Cycle 17 has a chord: (7, 2)
- Cycle 18 has a chord: (7, 12)
- Cycle 19 has a chord: (14, 0)
- Cycle 20 has a chord: (14, 0)
- Cycle 21 has a chord: (13, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [19].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 9, 1, (9, 1)>
<5, 11, 1, (11, 4)>
<5, 10, 4, (10, 8)>
<5, 6, 14, (14, 0)>
<9, 8, 4, (8, 10)>
<9, 11, 6, (11, 6)>
<1, 8, 9, (9, 14)>
<1, 4, 10, (4, 10)>
<4, 8, 9, (8, 9)>
<4, 10, 7, (4, 10)>
<8, 1, 14, (1, 14)>
<8, 4, 10, (4, 10)>
<8, 11, 6, (8, 11)>
<6, 14, 9, (14, 6)>
<6, 11, 7, (11, 7)>
<6, 7, 2, (7, 2)>
<6, 13, 7, (7, 13)>
<11, 6, 14, (14, 0)>
<11, 13, 7, (13, 7)>
