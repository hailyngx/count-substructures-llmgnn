Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 13) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 18) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 17) (18, 6) (18, 17) (19, 8) (19, 15) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 15) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 18) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Below are some cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-11-12-16-14 (length 4)
- Cycle 2: 2-11-12-16-14 (length 4)
- Cycle 3: 2-5-17-18-6-1 (length 5)
- Cycle 4: 3-8-13-9-5-2 (length 5)
- Cycle 5: 3-8-13-9-15-14-16-12-4 (length 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 (1-11-12-16-14) has a chord (12, 14) 
- Cycle 2 (2-11-12-16-14) has a chord (12, 14)
- Cycle 3 (2-5-17-18-6-1) has a chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 4 (3-8-13-9-5-2) has a chord (8, 5)
- Cycle 5 (3-8-13-9-15-14-16-12-4) has chords (8, 14) and (13, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
- <1, (12, 14), 11>
- <2, (12, 14), 11>
