Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 9) (4, 14) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 13) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 16) (1, 14) (1, 13) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 2) (13, 7) (13, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 9) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 19) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 11) (12, 3) (12, 0) (11, 18) (11, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (3, 0, 8, 14, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 0, 16, 18, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 0, 12, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 6, 5, 17, 3)
- Cycle 5: (15, 9, 16, 18, 15)
- Cycle 6: (15, 9, 11, 18, 15)
- Cycle 7: (15, 7, 19, 18, 15)
- Cycle 8: (15, 7, 19, 2, 15)
- Cycle 9: (15, 7, 13, 1, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 is chordal with chord (0, 8).
- Cycle 2 is chordal with chord (0, 16).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 7 chordless cycles: <3, 6, 5, 17>, <3, 0, 12>, <15, 9, 16, 18>, <15, 9, 11, 18>, <15, 7, 19, 18>, <15, 7, 19, 2>, <15, 7, 13, 1>.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
