Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 1-6-9-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-2-5-8-1
- Cycle 3: 2-1-6-9-2
- Cycle 4: 3-4-9-6-3
- Cycle 5: 4-5-7-0-4
- Cycle 6: 5-7-0-8-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- From Cycle 1, <1, (5, 9), 6>
- From Cycle 2, <1, (2, 8), 5>
- From Cycle 3, <2, (6, 9), 1>
- From Cycle 4, <3, (4, 6), 9>
- From Cycle 5, <4, (5, 7), 0>
- From Cycle 6, <5, (7, 0), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There were no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
