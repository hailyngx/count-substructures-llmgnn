Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 10) (7, 18) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 10) (19, 0) (19, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 18) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0-4-1-16-11-0
- Cycle 2: 0-19-1-13-15-3-0
- Cycle 3: 0-10-6-16-11-0
- Cycle 4: 0-10-2-5-3-0
- Cycle 5: 0-10-12-3-15-9-0
- Cycle 6: 1-16-6-10-0-19-1
- Cycle 7: 1-16-11-0-4-1
- Cycle 8: 1-19-0-10-6-16-1
- Cycle 9: 1-19-0-11-8-18-1
- Cycle 10: 2-5-3-15-9-14-2
- Cycle 11: 2-5-6-16-11-8-2
- Cycle 12: 2-10-0-11-8-18-2
- Cycle 13: 2-10-6-16-11-0-2
- Cycle 14: 3-12-10-6-5-3
- Cycle 15: 3-15-9-14-17-3
- Cycle 16: 4-0-10-6-16-1-4
- Cycle 17: 5-6-16-1-19-0-5
- Cycle 18: 5-6-10-0-19-1-5
- Cycle 19: 8-11-16-6-5-2-8
- Cycle 20: 8-18-1-19-0-11-8
- Cycle 21: 9-15-3-12-10-6-9
- Cycle 22: 9-14-17-3-5-2-9
- Cycle 23: 13-15-3-5-2-10-13
- Cycle 24: 13-15-9-14-17-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (4, 10), 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (16, 11), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (19, 10), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (5, 10), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, (6, 16), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <8, (11, 6), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <8, (18, 1), 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <9, (15, 3), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <13, (15, 3), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found: [9]
