Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 14) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 12) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (1, 6) (1, 8) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (6, 1, 8, 9, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 3, 4, 9, 7, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 0, 10, 11, 3, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 13, 4, 9, 14, 6)
- Cycle 5: (9, 8, 2, 14, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 4, 3, 11, 7, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 14, 2, 8, 4, 9)
- Cycle 8: (10, 11, 3, 4, 5, 10)
- Cycle 9: (10, 0, 6, 1, 8, 10)
- Cycle 10: (10, 12, 7, 9, 14, 10)
- Cycle 11: (11, 3, 6, 1, 8, 11)
- Cycle 12: (11, 14, 9, 4, 13, 11)
- Cycle 13: (4, 9, 8, 2, 14, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 3, 6, 1, 8, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 5, 10, 12, 7, 4)
- Cycle 16: (8, 9, 4, 13, 7, 8)
- Cycle 17: (8, 2, 14, 9, 4, 8)
- Cycle 18: (7, 9, 4, 13, 7)
- Cycle 19: (7, 11, 3, 4, 13, 7)
- Cycle 20: (7, 12, 10, 0, 6, 7)
- Cycle 21: (12, 10, 0, 6, 1, 12)
- Cycle 22: (12, 7, 9, 14, 10, 12)
- Cycle 23: (2, 8, 9, 4, 3, 2)
- Cycle 24: (2, 14, 9, 4, 13, 2)
- Cycle 25: (3, 6, 0, 10, 5, 3)
- Cycle 26: (3, 11, 14, 2, 8, 3)
- Cycle 27: (5, 10, 0, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 28: (5, 4, 9, 8, 2, 5)
- Cycle 29: (5, 14, 9, 4, 3, 5)
- Cycle 30: (13, 6, 0, 10, 12, 13)
- Cycle 31: (13, 4, 3, 11, 7, 13)
- Cycle 32: (1, 6, 0, 10, 5, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, (1, 4), 8, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, (3, 7), 4, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, (0, 10), 11, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6, (13, 9), 4, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (8, 2), 14, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, (4, 3), 11, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <9, (14, 2), 8, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <10, (12, 0), 6, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <10, (11, 3), 4, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <11, (14, 4), 9, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <8, (2, 14), 9, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <7, (12, 0), 10, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [12].
