Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 10) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 4) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 1) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 9) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 19) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 18) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 18) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 15) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (19, 12) (19, 9) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 18) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-4-17-10-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-15-13-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-2-0-1
- Cycle 4: 2-7-1-6-2
- Cycle 5: 2-0-16-18-2
- Cycle 6: 3-2-7-1-3
- Cycle 7: 3-2-0-16-3
- Cycle 8: 4-17-13-15-4
- Cycle 9: 6-12-9-19-6
- Cycle 10: 6-12-9-8-6
- Cycle 11: 6-1-7-2-6
- Cycle 12: 6-18-16-0-6
- Cycle 13: 8-9-12-6-8
- Cycle 14: 8-9-12-19-8
- Cycle 15: 8-11-15-13-8
- Cycle 16: 9-12-6-1-9
- Cycle 17: 9-12-19-9
- Cycle 18: 9-14-10-17-9
- Cycle 19: 10-17-4-15-10
- Cycle 20: 11-15-13-18-11
- Cycle 21: 13-15-11-6-13
- Cycle 22: 16-0-2-7-16
- Cycle 23: 16-0-2-3-16
- Cycle 24: 16-13-17-4-16
- Cycle 25: 16-13-15-11-16
- Cycle 26: 16-18-6-12-16
- Cycle 27: 18-3-2-7-18

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord: <6, 9>
- Cycle 10 has exactly one chord: <8, 9>
- Cycle 11 has exactly one chord: <1, 6>
- Cycle 12 has exactly one chord: <0, 16>
- Cycle 26 has exactly one chord: <6, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [22]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<1, 4, 17, 10>
