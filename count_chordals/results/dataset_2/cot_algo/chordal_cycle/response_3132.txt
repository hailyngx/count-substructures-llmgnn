Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 26) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 4) (27, 15) (27, 7) (27, 19) (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 18) (18, 3) (18, 25) (18, 22) (18, 0) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 8) (28, 9) (28, 13) (28, 20) (29, 15) (29, 1) (29, 5) (2, 0) (8, 22) (8, 9) (8, 12) (0, 18) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 1) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 8) (9, 17) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 26) (21, 17) (7, 27) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 26) (26, 16) (26, 21) (26, 7) (26, 12) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 12) (10, 0) (10, 23) (10, 20) (24, 22) (24, 7) (24, 17) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 29) (23, 10) (23, 13) (23, 12) (12, 8) (12, 26) (12, 1) (12, 23) (20, 28) (20, 10) (20, 13) (4, 15) (4, 13) (19, 27) (19, 7) (17, 9) (17, 21) (17, 24) (13, 28) (13, 23) (13, 20) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Let's list the cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 15-5-16-26-15
- Cycle 2: 15-27-7-24-22-18-3-15
- Cycle 3: 15-27-7-24-22-18-25-3-15
- Cycle 4: 15-27-7-24-22-18-0-2-14-1-15
- Cycle 5: 15-29-1-14-0-18-22-24-7-26-16-5-15
- Cycle 6: 15-29-1-14-0-18-22-24-7-27-15
- Cycle 7: 15-29-1-12-8-22-24-7-27-15

Step 2:
Let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord 5-26
- Cycle 2 has no chord
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has chord 24-18
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has chord 14-24
- Cycle 7 has chord 12-22

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, there are a total of 4 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
Therefore, the final count is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<15, (5, 26), 16>
<15, 27, 7, 24, 22, 18, 3, 15>
<15, (24, 18), 1, 14, 0, 29>
<15, 29, (14, 24), 1, 12, 8, 22, 7, 27>
