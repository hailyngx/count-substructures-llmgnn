Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-6-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-9-4-5
        - Cycle 3: 5-6-9-5
        - Cycle 4: 6-9-4-6
        - Cycle 5: 9-6-3-9
        - Cycle 6: 6-3-4-6
        - Cycle 7: 3-4-5-3
        - Cycle 8: 4-5-9-4
        - Cycle 9: 5-8-6-5
        - Cycle 10: 8-6-7-8
        - Cycle 11: 6-7-1-6
        - Cycle 12: 7-1-3-7
        - Cycle 13: 1-3-2-1
        - Cycle 14: 3-2-4-3
        - Cycle 15: 2-4-9-2
        - Cycle 16: 4-9-5-4
        - Cycle 17: 9-5-8-9
        - Cycle 18: 5-8-0-5
        - Cycle 19: 8-0-6-8
        - Cycle 20: 0-6-3-0
        - Cycle 21: 6-3-2-6
        - Cycle 22: 3-2-8-3
        - Cycle 23: 2-8-5-2
        - Cycle 24: 8-5-4-8
        - Cycle 25: 6-7-8-6
        - Cycle 26: 7-8-2-7
        - Cycle 27: 8-2-9-8
        - Cycle 28: 2-9-0-2
        - Cycle 29: 9-0-3-9
        - Cycle 30: 0-3-8-0

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - <1, (9-6)>
        - <2, (9-4)>
        - <3, (9-4)>
        - <4, (9-4)>
        - <5, (6-9)>
        - <6, (6-4)>
        - <7, (4-5)>
        - <8, (5-9)>
        - <9, (5-6)>
        - <10, (8-7)>
        - <11, (1-6)>
        - <12, (1-3)>
        - <13, (3-2)>
        - <14, (2-4)>
        - <15, (4-9)>
        - <16, (5-8)>
        - <17, (5-8)>
        - <18, (6-8)>
        - <19, (0-5)>
        - <20, (8-6)>
        - <21, (3-2)>
        - <22, (2-8)>
        - <23, (8-4)>
        - <24, (7-6)>
        - <25, (7-8)>
        - <26, (8-2)>
        - <27, (2-9)>
        - <28, (9-0)>
        - <29, (0-3)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [29]
