Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 3) (1, 21) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 19) (21, 25) (21, 2) (2, 21) (2, 29) (2, 19) (29, 2) (29, 17) (0, 20) (0, 23) (27, 20) (27, 9) (27, 5) (8, 10) (8, 25) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 25) (11, 3) (11, 28) (11, 15) (17, 29) (17, 10) (17, 24) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 28) (5, 27) (5, 12) (5, 15) (9, 1) (9, 27) (9, 18) (9, 16) (26, 28) (26, 6) (26, 7) (28, 11) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 23) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 16) (4, 15) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 24) (7, 1) (7, 26) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 12) (18, 9) (18, 6) (19, 21) (19, 2) (19, 24) (6, 10) (6, 26) (6, 18) (24, 17) (24, 12) (24, 19) (23, 0) (23, 28) (23, 4) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 10) (15, 11) (15, 5) (15, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-21-2-29-17-10-8-25-21
- Cycle 2: 1-21-2-29-17-10-6-26-28-20-0-23-4-3-22-13-1
- Cycle 3: 1-21-2-19-29-17-24-12-5-27-20-28-26-6-18-9-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-27-20-28-26-7-1
- Cycle 5: 1-9-27-5-15-11-3-22-13-1
- Cycle 6: 1-12-5-27-9-1
- Cycle 7: 1-12-5-15-11-3-4-23-0-20-27-9-16-12
- Cycle 8: 1-12-4-23-0-20-28-26-6-10-17-29-2-19-21-25-8-1
- Cycle 9: 1-7-26-6-10-17-29-2-21-25-8-1
- Cycle 10: 1-7-26-28-20-0-23-4-12-5-15-11-3-22-13-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 2 has a chord {3, 28}.
- Cycle 3 has a chord {5, 12}.
- Cycle 5 has a chord {13, 22}.
- Cycle 6 has a chord {1, 9}.
- Cycle 7 has a chord {5, 15}.
- Cycle 8 has a chord {4, 20}.
- Cycle 9 has a chord {6, 17}.
- Cycle 10 has a chord {7, 26}.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [2] chordal 4-cycles found.

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1-21-2-29-17-10-6-26-28-20-0-23-4-12-5-27-9-1, (1, 9)>
2. <1-21-2-29-17-10-8-25-21, (3, 28)>
