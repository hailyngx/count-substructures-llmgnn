Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 2) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 7) (5, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (0, 11) (0, 9) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (18, 19) (18, 15) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 9) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 3, 13, 17, 14, 15, 5, 18, 19, 6, 4, 3, 7, 16, 11)
- Cycle 2: (0, 9, 12, 1, 10, 3, 4, 6, 19, 18, 15, 14, 17, 13, 3, 16, 7, 2, 8, 11, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 11, 16, 7, 13, 17, 2, 8, 11)
- Cycle 4: (1, 17, 14, 15, 18, 19, 9, 12, 7, 16, 3, 13, 17, 2, 7, 2, 17, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 12, 9, 0, 11, 16, 7, 13, 17, 14, 15, 18, 19, 6, 4, 3, 13, 7, 2, 17, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (17, 15)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (12, 13)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (15, 9)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (11, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, thus [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (17, 15), 5)>
<0, (12, 13), 3)>
<11, (2, 8), 16)>
<9, (15, 9), 12)>
<6, (11, 6), 1)>
