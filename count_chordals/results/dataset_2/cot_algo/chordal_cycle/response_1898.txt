The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 9) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 3) (2, 5) (2, 12) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle <0, 13, 1, 11>
2. Cycle <0, 13, 5, 12>
3. Cycle <0, 13, 9, 14>
4. Cycle <0, 7, 8, 12>
5. Cycle <0, 7, 3, 13>
6. Cycle <0, 11, 3, 10>
7. Cycle <0, 11, 4, 1>
8. Cycle <5, 13, 3, 6>
9. Cycle <5, 13, 9, 14>
10. Cycle <5, 6, 3, 7>
11. Cycle <5, 6, 3, 10>
12. Cycle <5, 6, 12, 10>
13. Cycle <5, 12, 4, 11>
14. Cycle <6, 5, 12, 10>
15. Cycle <11, 0, 13, 5>
16. Cycle <11, 0, 7, 3>
17. Cycle <11, 0, 7, 8>
18. Cycle <11, 8, 12, 5>
19. Cycle <11, 8, 12, 10>
20. Cycle <11, 1, 4, 12>
21. Cycle <13, 0, 7, 8>
22. Cycle <13, 0, 11, 3>
23. Cycle <13, 5, 6, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle <0, 13, 1, 11> has one chord 9, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <0, (1, 11), 13>
- Cycle <0, 13, 5, 12> has one chord 7, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <5, (12, 0), 13>
- Cycle <0, 13, 9, 14> has one chord 7, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <0, (9, 14), 13>
- Cycle <0, 7, 8, 12> has one chord 0, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle <0, 7, 3, 13> has one chord 0, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle <0, 11, 3, 10> has one chord 0, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle <0, 11, 4, 1> has one chord 13, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <1, (4, 11), 0>
- Cycle <5, 13, 3, 6> has one chord 7, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <5, (3, 6), 13>
- Cycle <5, 13, 9, 14> has one chord 1, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <13, (14, 9), 5>
- Cycle <5, 6, 3, 7> has one chord 5, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <6, (3, 7), 5>
- Cycle <5, 6, 3, 10> has one chord 12, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <6, (3, 10), 5>
- Cycle <5, 6, 12, 10> has one chord 3, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <12, (6, 10), 5>
- Cycle <5, 12, 4, 11> has one chord 5, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <12, (4, 11), 5>
- Cycle <6, 5, 12, 10> has one chord 6, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <10, (12, 5), 6>
- Cycle <11, 0, 13, 5> has one chord 11, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <5, (0, 13), 11>
- Cycle <11, 0, 7, 3> has one chord 11, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <3, (7, 0), 11>
- Cycle <11, 8, 12, 5> has one chord 11, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <12, (8, 5), 11>
- Cycle <11, 8, 12, 10> has one chord 11, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <12, (8, 10), 11>
- Cycle <11, 1, 4, 12> has one chord 11, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <4, (1, 12), 11>
- Cycle <13, 0, 7, 8> has one chord 13, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <7, (8, 0), 13>
- Cycle <13, 0, 11, 3> has one chord 13, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <3, (11, 0), 13>
- Cycle <13, 5, 6, 3> has one chord 13, so it is a chordal 4-cycle: <6, (5, 3), 13>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 11
Therefore, the final answer is [11].
