Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 3, 4, 7, 1)
- (1, 5, 12, 7, 1)
- (3, 4, 7, 12, 3)
- (3, 8, 13, 4, 3)
- (4, 13, 8, 11, 4)
- (7, 12, 1, 5, 7)
- (9, 11, 8, 13, 9)
- (10, 13, 8, 11, 10)
- (12, 5, 1, 3, 12)
- (14, 0, 4, 13, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (7, 12), 5)>
- <3, (8, 13), 4)>
- <8, (13, 4), 11)>
- <9, (13, 8), 11)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
