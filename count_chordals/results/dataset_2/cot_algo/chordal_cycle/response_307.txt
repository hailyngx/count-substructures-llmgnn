Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 2) (9, 2) (9, 14) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 3-7-12-11-3
        - Cycle 2: 3-12-13-6-3
        - Cycle 3: 3-2-10-5-3
        - Cycle 4: 3-5-13-6-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <3-7-12-11-3>: (7, 11)
        - <3-12-13-6-3>: (12, 6)
        - <3-2-10-5-3>: (2, 5)
        - <3-5-13-6-3>: (5, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
        We found 0 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
