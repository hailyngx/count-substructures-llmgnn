Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 14) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

(5, 9, 10, 6)  
(5, 9, 3, 14)  
(5, 0, 3, 14)  
(5, 8, 4, 1)  
(9, 3, 1, 4)  
(9, 10, 6, 7)  
(1, 3, 0, 5)  
(1, 4, 8, 5)  
(3, 14, 6, 10)  
(10, 6, 14, 13)  
(10, 12, 4, 1)  
(10, 13, 4, 14)  
(11, 7, 0, 5)  
(11, 13, 4, 8)  
(4, 14, 6, 10)  


Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<5, 9, 10, 6, (3, 14)>  
<1, 3, 0, 5, (9, 4)>  
<1, 4, 8, 5, (10, 6)>  
<3, 14, 6, 10, (9, 4)>  


Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are [4] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
