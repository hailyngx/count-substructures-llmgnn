Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (0, 5, 11, 8, 0) 
- (2, 5, 0, 1, 2) 
- (12, 5, 0, 9, 12) 
- (7, 6, 14, 9, 7) 
- (3, 11, 0, 9, 3) 

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- (0, 5, 11, 8, 0) has chord <5, 8>
- (2, 5, 0, 1, 2) has chord <0, 1>
- (12, 5, 0, 9, 12) has chord <0, 9>
- (7, 6, 14, 9, 7) has chord <6, 9>
- (3, 11, 0, 9, 3) has chord <0, 9>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 5, 11, 8, 0> with chord <5, 8>
<2, 5, 0, 1, 2> with chord <0, 1>
<12, 5, 0, 9, 12> with chord <0, 9>
<7, 6, 14, 9, 7> with chord <6, 9>
<3, 11, 0, 9, 3> with chord <0, 9>
