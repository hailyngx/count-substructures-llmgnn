Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 2) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, but the ones of length 4 or more are:
- Cycle 1: 1-9-10-7-1
- Cycle 2: 1-9-14-6-4-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-11-4-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-11-13-1
- Cycle 5: 1-3-12-8-1
- Cycle 6: 1-12-4-2-1
- Cycle 7: 3-11-13-8-3
- Cycle 8: 3-12-4-2-3
- Cycle 9: 3-12-8-14-3
- Cycle 10: 5-8-13-11-5
- Cycle 11: 5-10-7-0-5
- Cycle 12: 5-10-14-9-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Using the cycles above, we find that Cycle 6: 1-12-4-2-1 has exactly one chord 4-2.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

List of unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, 12, 4, 2>
