Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 29) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 20) (9, 5) (18, 22) (18, 7) (23, 13) (23, 0) (24, 6) (24, 8) (24, 20) (4, 13) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 24) (8, 4) (8, 29) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 19) (21, 17) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 1) (28, 20) (1, 28) (1, 17) (1, 25) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 7) (26, 11) (26, 16) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 2) (10, 13) (10, 21) (10, 14) (3, 13) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 24) (6, 4) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 26) (16, 12) (16, 27) (16, 20) (11, 26) (11, 14) (11, 27) (11, 29) (14, 10) (14, 11) (0, 23) (0, 3) (0, 25) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 3) (7, 18) (7, 17) (7, 15) (15, 12) (15, 7) (25, 1) (25, 0) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 11) (20, 5) (20, 24) (20, 28) (20, 16) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (13, 22, 18, 7, 17, 21, 10, 13)
- Cycle 2: (13, 22, 18, 7, 15, 12, 16, 26, 11, 29, 8, 4, 13)
- Cycle 3: (13, 3, 28, 20, 24, 8, 4, 13)
- Cycle 4: (13, 3, 2, 17, 7, 18, 22, 29, 11, 26, 16, 20, 28, 21, 10, 13)
- Cycle 5: (13, 3, 2, 19, 21, 10, 14, 11, 26, 16, 20, 28, 3)
- Cycle 6: (13, 23, 0, 25, 1, 28, 3, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <13, (21, 17), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <13, (4, 8), 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <13, (3, 28), 20>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <13, (22, 29), 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <13, (2, 19), 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <13, (25, 1), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found: [6]
