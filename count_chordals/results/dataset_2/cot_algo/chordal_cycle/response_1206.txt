Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle: (1, 7, 4, 3, 1)
2. Cycle: (1, 7, 4, 9, 6, 2, 7)
3. Cycle: (1, 7, 2, 3, 4, 9, 7)
4. Cycle: (1, 7, 2, 6, 9, 4, 7)
5. Cycle: (1, 3, 4, 9, 6, 2, 1)
6. Cycle: (1, 3, 4, 9, 7, 2, 1)
7. Cycle: (1, 3, 2, 7, 9, 4, 1)
8. Cycle: (1, 3, 2, 6, 9, 4, 1)
9. Cycle: (1, 3, 2, 7, 4, 9, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle (1, 7, 4, 3, 1) has the chord (7, 3).
- The cycle (1, 7, 4, 9, 6, 2, 7) has the chord (7, 2).
- The cycle (1, 7, 2, 3, 4, 9, 7) has the chord (2, 9).
- The cycle (1, 7, 2, 6, 9, 4, 7) has the chord (2, 9).
- The cycle (1, 3, 4, 9, 6, 2, 1) has the chord (4, 6).
- The cycle (1, 3, 4, 9, 7, 2, 1) has the chord (4, 7).
- The cycle (1, 3, 2, 7, 9, 4, 1) has the chord (2, 4).
- The cycle (1, 3, 2, 6, 9, 4, 1) has the chord (2, 4).
- The cycle (1, 3, 2, 7, 4, 9, 1) has the chord (2, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
[9]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (7, 3)>
<1, (7, 2)>
<1, (2, 9)>
<1, (4, 6)>
<1, (4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4)>
