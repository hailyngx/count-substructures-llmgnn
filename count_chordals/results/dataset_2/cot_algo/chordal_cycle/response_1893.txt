Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 7, 2, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 5, 1, 3, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 3, 1, 5, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 8, 4, 0, 6)
- Cycle 5: (9, 8, 4, 0, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 7, 1, 0, 9)
- Cycle 7: (1, 3, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 8: (7, 2, 9, 0, 7)
- Cycle 9: (8, 4, 0, 1, 8)
- Cycle 10: (5, 4, 8, 3, 5)

Step 2:
- Only Cycle 1 has a chord (7, 9), all other cycles are chordless. 

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <6, 9, 7, 2> with chord (7, 9)
