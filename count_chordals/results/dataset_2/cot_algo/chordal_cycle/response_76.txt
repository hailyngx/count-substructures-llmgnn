Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 1) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 3, 0, 5)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (4, 13, 6, 9)
- Cycle 5: (7, 9, 11, 1)
- Cycle 6: (7, 2, 1, 11)
- Cycle 7: (7, 13, 3, 0)
- Cycle 8: (6, 9, 11, 14)
- Cycle 9: (6, 0, 3, 14)
- Cycle 10: (6, 13, 4, 8)
- Cycle 11: (9, 8, 12, 1)
- Cycle 12: (8, 13, 6, 9)
- Cycle 13: (0, 3, 13, 4)
- Cycle 14: (14, 11, 9, 6)
- Cycle 15: (2, 1, 5, 8)
- Cycle 16: (11, 1, 5, 10)
- Cycle 17: (3, 13, 6, 14)
- Cycle 18: (1, 11, 14, 6)
- Cycle 19: (5, 8, 12, 1)
- Cycle 20: (12, 1, 5, 10)

Step 2:
From the list above, the cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (4, 7), 5>
- <2, (4, 3), 5>
- <3, (4, 8), 5>
- <6, (7, 2), 1>
- <7, (7, 13), 0>
- <8, (6, 9), 11>
- <11, (9, 8), 12>
- <12, (8, 13), 6>
- <13, (3, 13), 4>
- <19, (5, 8), 12>

Step 3:
Count of chordless 4-cycles: [4]
