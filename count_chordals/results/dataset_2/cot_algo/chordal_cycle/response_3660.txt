Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 18) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 17) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 15) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 16) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 15) (18, 5) (18, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 9) (16, 14) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 12) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 16) (0, 11) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
Following the steps provided, we can find the chordal 4-cycles in this graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 16, 14, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 3, 11, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 9, 8, 1, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 16, 14, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 12, 17, 13, 4)
- Cycle 6: (7, 16, 14, 4, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 16, 9, 4, 7)
- Cycle 8: (7, 16, 10, 11, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 14, 16, 9, 7)
- Cycle 10: (7, 14, 18, 5, 7)
- Cycle 11: (3, 7, 14, 16, 3)
- Cycle 12: (3, 11, 10, 16, 3)
- Cycle 13: (3, 17, 13, 5, 3)
- Cycle 14: (9, 16, 14, 4, 9)
- Cycle 15: (17, 13, 5, 19, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (7, 14), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2 has chord (4, 11), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 has chord (4, 8), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 4 has chord (9, 16), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 5 has chord (12, 17), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 6 has chord (7, 14), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 7 has chord (7, 16), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 8 has chord (7, 11), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 9 has chord (7, 16), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 10 has chord (7, 14), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 11 has chord (7, 14), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 12 has chord (3, 16), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 13 has chord (3, 13), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 14 has chord (9, 14), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 15 has chord (5, 13), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordal 4-cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
