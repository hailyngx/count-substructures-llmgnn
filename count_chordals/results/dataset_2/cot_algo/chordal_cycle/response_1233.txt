Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (10, 3, 0, 11, 10)
- Cycle 2: (10, 6, 7, 12, 10)
- Cycle 3: (10, 12, 11, 2, 10)
- Cycle 4: (10, 1, 13, 5, 10)
- Cycle 5: (11, 14, 2, 9, 11)
- Cycle 6: (12, 7, 6, 5, 12)
- Cycle 7: (12, 4, 12)
- Cycle 8: (2, 11, 12, 7, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 14, 9, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 9, 8, 1, 2)
- Cycle 11: (5, 6, 10, 3, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 13, 10, 6, 5)
- Cycle 13: (6, 10, 12, 7, 6)
- Cycle 14: (6, 13, 1, 10, 6)

Next, let's check each of these cycles for the presence of exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1, < (10, 3, 0, 11, 10) > has no chords.
- Cycle 2, < (10, 6, 7, 12, 10) > has no chords.
- Cycle 3, < (10, 12, 11, 2, 10) > has no chords.
- Cycle 4, < (10, 1, 13, 5, 10) > has no chords.
- Cycle 5, < (11, 14, 2, 9, 11) > has no chords.
- Cycle 6, < (12, 7, 6, 5, 12) > has no chords.
- Cycle 7, < (12, 4, 12) > has no chords.
- Cycle 8, < (2, 11, 12, 7, 2) > has one chord: (11, 7).
- Cycle 9, < (2, 14, 9, 2) > has no chords.
- Cycle 10, < (2, 9, 8, 1, 2) > has one chord: (9, 1).
- Cycle 11, < (5, 6, 10, 3, 5) > has no chords.
- Cycle 12, < (5, 13, 10, 6, 5) > has no chords.
- Cycle 13, < (6, 10, 12, 7, 6) > has one chord: (10, 7).
- Cycle 14, < (6, 13, 1, 10, 6) > has no chords.

From the above analysis, there are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found with one chord each. Therefore, the final count is [3].
