Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 19) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 16) (0, 10) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 15) (19, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 15) (11, 18) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 18) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 5) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 14) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 3) (17, 7) (17, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 8, 2, 3, 10, 0, 7, 12, 13)
- Cycle 2: (1, 8, 2, 17, 7, 12, 13, 9)
- Cycle 3: (1, 13, 9, 14, 15, 5, 6, 19)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 6, 19, 16, 0, 7, 17)
- Cycle 5: (2, 8, 1, 5, 15, 16, 0, 7)
- Cycle 6: (2, 8, 1, 13, 12, 7, 17, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 17, 7, 12, 0, 16, 15, 5)
- Cycle 8: (3, 2, 8, 1, 13, 9, 14, 15)
- Cycle 9: (3, 4, 13, 12, 7, 17, 2, 11)
- Cycle 10: (4, 10, 0, 7, 12, 13, 9, 14)
- Cycle 11: (4, 10, 0, 16, 15, 14, 9, 13)
- Cycle 12: (4, 3, 2, 8, 1, 5, 15, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord: (3, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <3, (2, 8)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
