Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 20) (22, 26) (22, 12) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (2, 16) (2, 20) (29, 16) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 19) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 24) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 27) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 18) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 28) (1, 19) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 10) (18, 8) (18, 27) (18, 6) (17, 3) (17, 11) (21, 28) (28, 1) (28, 21) (28, 19) (28, 24) (28, 23) (11, 17) (11, 19) (23, 28) (23, 25) (14, 1) (14, 26) (14, 20) (14, 10) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 29) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 26) (10, 14) (10, 0) (6, 18) (6, 24) (6, 25) (24, 5) (24, 28) (24, 6) (12, 22) (12, 5) (12, 0) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 28) (19, 11) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 9) (20, 14) (27, 3) (27, 9) (27, 18) (25, 23) (25, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph - 

There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, but not all of them have all edges present in the given edge set. 
Here are the cycles with all edges present: 

Cycle 1:  (4, 7, 19, 1, 8, 4)
Cycle 2:  (5, 15, 9, 20, 14, 5)
Cycle 3:  (0, 4, 5, 12, 22, 26, 10, 0)
Cycle 4:  (16, 29, 16)
Cycle 5:  (28, 1, 8, 0, 10, 26, 14, 28)
Cycle 6:  (3, 15, 9, 27, 18, 6, 24, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord -

- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 19)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (9, 20)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (0, 22)
- Cycle 4 has no chords
- Cycle 5 has a chord  (8, 10)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (9, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found -

There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle in the given graph, which is <16, 29, 16, 3> with chord (16, 29). 

Thus, the final answer is [1].
