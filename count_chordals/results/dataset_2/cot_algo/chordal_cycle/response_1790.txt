Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 14) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (1, 3, 4, 8, 12)
- (6, 9, 14, 7, 4)
- (3, 7, 14, 9, 6)
- (2, 1, 12, 8, 4)
- (10, 6, 11, 14, 9)
- (5, 13, 12, 0, 1)
- (12, 0, 2, 5, 13)

Step 2: Check for chords in each cycle:
- <1, 12, 3, (4, 8), 12> (Chord: (4, 8))
- <6, 9, 14, (7, 4), 9> (Chord: (7, 4))
- <3, 7, 14, (9, 6), 3> (Chord: (9, 6))
- <2, 1, 12, (8, 4), 2> (Chord: (8, 4))
- <10, 6, 11, (14, 9), 10> (Chord: (14, 9))
- <5, 13, 12, (0, 1), 5> (Chord: (0, 1))
- <12, 0, 2, (5, 13), 12> (Chord: (5, 13))

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles = [7]
