Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 11) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 14) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. (6, 9, 4, 7) - forms a 4-cycle
2. (6, 9, 14, 13) - forms a 4-cycle
3. (6, 13, 14, 9) - forms a 4-cycle
4. (9, 4, 7, 12) - forms a 4-cycle
5. (9, 4, 12, 6) - forms a 4-cycle
6. (4, 7, 5, 3) - forms a 4-cycle
7. (7, 5, 2, 6) - forms a 4-cycle
8. (7, 4, 12, 0) - forms a 4-cycle
9. (8, 4, 12, 0) - forms a 4-cycle
10. (8, 11, 0, 12) - forms a 4-cycle
11. (12, 7, 4, 9) - forms a 4-cycle
12. (12, 4, 9, 6) - forms a 4-cycle
13. (12, 0, 10, 1) - forms a 4-cycle
14. (0, 12, 6, 9) - forms a 4-cycle
15. (0, 12, 4, 8) - forms a 4-cycle
16. (0, 12, 7, 5) - forms a 4-cycle
17. (0, 3, 5, 7) - forms a 4-cycle
18. (0, 3, 10, 1) - forms a 4-cycle
19. (0, 1, 10, 3) - forms a 4-cycle
20. (0, 1, 14, 13) - forms a 4-cycle
21. (10, 0, 12, 4) - forms a 4-cycle
22. (10, 0, 3, 5) - forms a 4-cycle
23. (10, 1, 14, 13) - forms a 4-cycle
24. (3, 6, 2, 5) - forms a 4-cycle
25. (3, 5, 7, 4) - forms a 4-cycle
26. (3, 10, 0, 12) - forms a 4-cycle
27. (2, 6, 9, 14) - forms a 4-cycle
28. (2, 5, 3, 6) - forms a 4-cycle
29. (2, 13, 14, 9) - forms a 4-cycle
30. (5, 7, 4, 9) - forms a 4-cycle
31. (5, 3, 0, 12) - forms a 4-cycle
32. (5, 2, 6, 9) - forms a 4-cycle
33. (14, 9, 4, 12) - forms a 4-cycle
34. (14, 1, 10, 0) - forms a 4-cycle
35. (14, 13, 0, 12) - forms a 4-cycle
36. (1, 0, 12, 7) - forms a 4-cycle
37. (1, 10, 0, 3) - forms a 4-cycle
38. (1, 14, 13, 6) - forms a 4-cycle

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, we can see that the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <1, (14, 13), 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we find that there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (14, 13), 6>.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
