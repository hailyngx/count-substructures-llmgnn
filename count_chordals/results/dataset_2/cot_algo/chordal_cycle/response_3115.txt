Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-10-6-4
- Cycle 2: 4-11-10-6-4
- Cycle 3: 4-11-13-5-4
- Cycle 4: 4-11-14-12-4
- Cycle 5: 7-10-11-13-7
- Cycle 6: 7-10-11-14-7
- Cycle 7: 7-3-5-13-7
- Cycle 8: 6-10-11-14-6
- Cycle 9: 6-10-0-1-6
- Cycle 10: 6-1-8-13-6
- Cycle 11: 6-1-5-3-6
- Cycle 12: 9-11-14-12-9
- Cycle 13: 11-13-5-3-11
- Cycle 14: 11-14-12-2-11
- Cycle 15: 13-5-3-12-13

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- <4, (7, 10), 6>
- <4, (11, 13), 5>
- <4, (11, 14), 12>
- <7, (10, 11), 13>
- <7, (3, 5), 13>
- <6, (10, 0), 1>
- <6, (1, 8), 13>
- <6, (1, 5), 3>
- <9, (11, 14), 12>
- <11, (13, 5), 3>
- <11, (14, 12), 2>
- <13, (5, 3), 12>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [12]
