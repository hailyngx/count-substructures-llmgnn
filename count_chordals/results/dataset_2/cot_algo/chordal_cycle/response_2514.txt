Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 9) (7, 13) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 12) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 5) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 5) (5, 16) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 19) (15, 7) (15, 18) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 12) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 15) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 6, 14, 16, 8, 3, 11, 2, 19, 10, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 6, 7, 15, 18, 0, 9, 12, 2, 11, 3)
- Cycle 3: (7, 15, 18, 10, 5, 16, 13, 3, 8, 1, 11)
- Cycle 4: (7, 13, 3, 8, 16, 14, 6, 19, 12, 9, 17)
- Cycle 5: (14, 6, 19, 10, 0, 18, 15, 7, 13, 16, 8)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord <3, 11>
- Cycle 2 has chord <7, 15>
- Cycle 3 has chord <13, 16>
- Cycle 4 has chord <8, 14>
- Cycle 5 has chord <6, 19>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5] 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<4, 6, 14, 16, 8> with chord (3, 11)
<4, 6, 7, 15, 18> with chord (7, 15)
<7, 15, 18, 10, 5> with chord (13, 16)
<7, 13, 3, 8, 16> with chord (8, 14)
<14, 6, 19, 10, 0> with chord (6, 19)
