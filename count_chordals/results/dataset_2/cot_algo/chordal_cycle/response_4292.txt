Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycles:
<11, (10, 1), 16>, <11, (10, 1), 16>
<11, (14, 0), 16>
<16, (8, 18), 19>
<16, (10, 1), 0>, <16, (10, 1), 0>
<16, (10, 1), 4>
<5, (9, 17), 0>, <5, (9, 17), 0>
<5, (9, 17), 4>
<9, (17, 0), 14>
<9, (17, 4), 17>
<9, (5, 7), 15>
<3, (12, 6), 13>
<3, (12, 11), 14>
<3, (13, 9), 17>
<3, (4, 1), 10>
<0, (7, 5), 9>
<0, (14, 11), 12>
<0, (17, 4), 1>
<0, (17, 4), 13>
<14, (11, 12), 3>
<4, (1, 10), 11>
<4, (17, 9), 13>
<18, (19, 16), 8>
<19, (18, 8), 16>
<2, (9, 5), 7>
<2, (9, 17), 4>
<6, (12, 11), 10>
<6, (13, 9), 5>
<6, (13, 9), 17>
<1, (10, 11), 12>
<1, (4, 17), 9>
<1, (0, 7), 5>
<17, (9, 13), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
