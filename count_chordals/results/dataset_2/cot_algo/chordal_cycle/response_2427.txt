Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 1, 7, 4, 5)
- (5, 4, 6, 3, 5)
- (5, 7, 2, 3, 5)
- (5, 8, 9, 2, 5)
- (4, 7, 1, 5, 4)
- (4, 6, 3, 5, 4)
- (7, 1, 0, 5, 7)
- (7, 2, 3, 5, 7)
- (1, 0, 2, 5, 1)
- (1, 8, 3, 5, 1)
- (3, 6, 4, 5, 3)
- (0, 2, 7, 5, 0)
- (2, 9, 8, 5, 2)
- (8, 3, 6, 5, 8)
- (6, 0, 2, 5, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, (1, 7), 4, 5>
- <5, (4, 6), 3, 5>
- <5, (7, 2), 3, 5>
- <5, (8, 9), 2, 5>
- <4, (7, 1), 5, 4>
- <4, (6, 3), 5, 4>
- <7, (1, 0), 5, 7>
- <7, (2, 3), 5, 7>
- <1, (0, 2), 5, 1>
- <1, (8, 3), 5, 1>
- <3, (6, 4), 5, 3>
- <0, (2, 7), 5, 0>
- <2, (9, 8), 5, 2>
- <8, (3, 6), 5, 8>
- <6, (0, 2), 5, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [15].
