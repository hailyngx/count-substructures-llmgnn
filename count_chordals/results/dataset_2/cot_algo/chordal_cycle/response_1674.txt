Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 14) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (4, 9) (4, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 7, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 11, 10, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 14, 8, 7, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 12, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 7, 11, 13, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 5, 10, 12, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 8, 14, 7, 9)
- Cycle 8: (6, 7, 10, 12, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 2, 1, 12, 6)
- Cycle 10: (1, 2, 6, 12, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 13, 11, 3, 1)
- Cycle 12: (3, 11, 7, 14, 3)
- Cycle 13: (3, 0, 1, 13, 3)
- Cycle 14: (10, 5, 14, 7, 10)
- Cycle 15: (11, 9, 5, 2, 11)
- Cycle 16: (11, 3, 0, 4, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (9, 7) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (9, 11) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (8, 14) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (5, 12) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (9, 13) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (5, 12) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (8, 14) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (2, 12) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (1, 6) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (2, 6) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (11, 1) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (11, 14) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (0, 13) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 14 has a chord: (5, 7) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 15 has a chord: (5, 11) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 16 has a chord: (0, 4) => Not a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are no chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph. Therefore, the final count is [0].
