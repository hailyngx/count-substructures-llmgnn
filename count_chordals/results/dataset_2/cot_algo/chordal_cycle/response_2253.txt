Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 12) (15, 2) (7, 19) (7, 5) (12, 15) (12, 1) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (9, 10) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 18) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 17) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 13) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 4) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 19) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 13) (4, 10) (4, 17) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 16) (5, 17) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-12-15-2-1
- Cycle 2: 10-9-10
- Cycle 3: 0-16-5-3-0
- Cycle 4: 0-16-14-19-13-6-18-11-17-4-10-0
- Cycle 5: 0-16-17-5-0
- Cycle 6: 0-18-11-17-16-0
- Cycle 7: 0-18-6-19-14-16-0
- Cycle 8: 1-12-1
- Cycle 9: 2-15-12-1-8-2
- Cycle 10: 3-2-15-12-1-8-2-3
- Cycle 11: 3-2-15-12-1-8-2-3-5-19-6-13-10-4-17-3
- Cycle 12: 4-10-13-6-19-14-16-5-17-4
- Cycle 13: 4-10-13-19-14-16-0-18-11-17-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 8, 1, (2, 15)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 16, 5, (3, 17)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 18, 6, (19, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 12, 15, (2, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, 10, 13, (6, 19)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final number is [5].
