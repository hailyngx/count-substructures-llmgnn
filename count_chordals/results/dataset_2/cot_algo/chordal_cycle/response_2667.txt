Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. (1, 4, 7, 5)
2. (1, 4, 8, 2)
3. (1, 4, 7, 6)
4. (1, 5, 7, 6)
5. (1, 5, 7, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the cycles listed above, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 7), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
