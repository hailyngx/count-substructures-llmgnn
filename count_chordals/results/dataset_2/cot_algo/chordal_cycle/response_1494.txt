Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 11) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 20) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 6) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 2) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 7) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 26) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 22) (12, 7) (12, 5) (14, 0) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 29) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 21) (18, 17) (26, 20) (28, 25) (28, 13) (10, 3) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 29) (15, 17) (11, 25) (11, 23) (11, 5) (11, 21) (16, 19) (19, 22) (19, 16) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 17) (1, 13) (29, 4) (29, 15) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 24) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 24) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 6) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 27) (17, 9) (17, 21) (24, 5) (24, 9) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 17) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. Below are the cycles found in the graph:

1. Cycle <3, 25, 27, 11>
2. Cycle <3, 25, 28, 13>
3. Cycle <3, 25, 11, 23>
4. Cycle <3, 7, 8, 13>
5. Cycle <3, 7, 12, 22>
6. Cycle <3, 10, 2, 15>
7. Cycle <25, 3, 4, 18>
8. Cycle <8, 3, 4, 18>
9. Cycle <8, 13, 28, 25>
10. Cycle <13, 8, 20, 26>
11. Cycle <13, 1, 7, 12>
12. Cycle <22, 23, 11, 5>
13. Cycle <22, 19, 16, 19>
14. Cycle <23, 22, 19, 16>
15. Cycle <0, 20, 8, 7>
16. Cycle <0, 14, 0, 20>
17. Cycle <14, 0, 7, 3>
18. Cycle <20, 8, 3, 7>
19. Cycle <7, 3, 4, 18>
20. Cycle <7, 12, 22, 19>
21. Cycle <12, 22, 19, 16>
22. Cycle <4, 18, 27, 25>
23. Cycle <18, 4, 3, 7>
24. Cycle <18, 27, 25, 11>
25. Cycle <18, 21, 11, 5>
26. Cycle <26, 20, 8, 3>
27. Cycle <28, 25, 11, 5>
28. Cycle <10, 3, 7, 12>
29. Cycle <15, 9, 17, 15>
30. Cycle <15, 29, 4, 18>
31. Cycle <15, 17, 27, 18>
32. Cycle <11, 25, 27, 18>
33. Cycle <11, 23, 22, 19>
34. Cycle <11, 5, 23, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. Only one chordal 4-cycle was found.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <<3, 25>, <8, 13>>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
