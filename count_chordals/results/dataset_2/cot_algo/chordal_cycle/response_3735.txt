Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle: 0-5-9-7-0
2. Cycle: 0-5-8-2-0
3. Cycle: 1-5-9-2-1
4. Cycle: 2-9-7-3-2
5. Cycle: 3-7-9-5-3
6. Cycle: 4-6-2-8-4
7. Cycle: 4-6-2-9-4
8. Cycle: 5-8-2-9-5
9. Cycle: 5-9-2-6-5
10. Cycle: 8-2-4-0-8

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, 9, 2> (Chord: (0, 2))
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, 8, 2> (Chord: (0, 2))
3. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 5, 9, 2> (Chord: (1, 2))
4. Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 7, 9, 5> (Chord: (3, 5))
5. Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 6, 2, 8> (Chord: (4, 8))
6. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 8, 2, 9> (Chord: (5, 9))

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [6]
