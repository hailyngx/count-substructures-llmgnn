Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 4-8-2-4
- Cycle 2: 4-6-3-4
- Cycle 3: 4-5-0-6-4
- Cycle 4: 8-1-5-7-8
- Cycle 5: 2-0-6-3-2
- Cycle 6: 5-3-9-1-5
- Cycle 7: 4-8-7-9-4

Step 2:
In these cycles, only Cycle 7: <4, 8, 7, 9> has exactly one chord (8, 9).

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, 8, 7, 9>.
