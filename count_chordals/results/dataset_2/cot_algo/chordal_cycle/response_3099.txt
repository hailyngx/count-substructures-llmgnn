Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle with nodes {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Cycle with nodes {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Cycle with nodes {1, 6, 8, 7}
- Cycle with nodes {1, 5, 4, 9}
- Cycle with nodes {2, 1, 3, 9}
- Cycle with nodes {2, 1, 6, 8}
- Cycle with nodes {2, 1, 4, 9}
- Cycle with nodes {2, 8, 6, 5}
- Cycle with nodes {2, 9, 4, 5}
- Cycle with nodes {2, 8, 7, 1}
- Cycle with nodes {3, 4, 5, 1}
- Cycle with nodes {3, 1, 6, 8}
- Cycle with nodes {3, 1, 9, 2}
- Cycle with nodes {3, 4, 9, 2}
- Cycle with nodes {4, 5, 1, 6}
- Cycle with nodes {4, 9, 2, 8}
- Cycle with nodes {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Cycle with nodes {5, 4, 9, 6}
- Cycle with nodes {6, 8, 2, 1}
- Cycle with nodes {6, 8, 7, 1}
- Cycle with nodes {7, 8, 6, 5}
- Cycle with nodes {7, 1, 4, 5}
- Cycle with nodes {7, 8, 2, 9}

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 3, (4, 5), 9>
- <1, (4, 5), 6, 7>
- <2, 1, 3, (9, 8)> 

Step 3:
Final number of chordal 4-cycles: [3]
