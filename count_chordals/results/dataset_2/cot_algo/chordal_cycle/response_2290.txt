Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 1 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 2: 4 - 9 - 8 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 0 - 1 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 4: 4 - 2 - 6 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 5: 7 - 0 - 1 - 8 - 7

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 2: Chord (9, 8)
- Cycle 3: Chord (0, 7)
- Cycle 4: Chord (2, 4)
- Cycle 5: Chord (0, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<4, (1, 3), 7)>
<4, (9, 8), 3)>
<4, (0, 7), 1)>
<4, (2, 4), 0)>
<7, (0, 1), 8)>
