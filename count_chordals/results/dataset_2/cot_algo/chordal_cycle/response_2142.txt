Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 11) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 5) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-14-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-5-0
- Cycle 4: 0-2-13-0
- Cycle 5: 0-3-1-0
- Cycle 6: 0-3-10-0
- Cycle 7: 0-4-13-0
- Cycle 8: 0-9-6-0
- Cycle 9: 5-2-10-5
- Cycle 10: 5-7-1-5
- Cycle 11: 5-7-12-5
- Cycle 12: 5-8-11-5
- Cycle 13: 13-2-10-13

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-3-0 has one chord: (0,3) -> Chordal cycle: <0,1,3,0> (0,3)
- Cycle 4: 0-2-13-0 has one chord: (0,2) -> Chordal cycle: <0,2,13,0> (0,2)
- Cycle 9: 5-2-10-5 has one chord: (2,10) -> Chordal cycle: <5,2,10,5> (2,10)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0,1,3,0> (0,3)
<0,2,13,0> (0,2)
<5,2,10,5> (2,10)
