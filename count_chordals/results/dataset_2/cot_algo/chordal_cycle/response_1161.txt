Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 17) (8, 14) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 18) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 16) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 17) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 9) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 1) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 17) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 15) (9, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <7, 1, 4, 12>
- Cycle <19, 7, 11, 18>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <7, 1, 4, 12> has exactly one chord: (1, 4)
2. <19, 7, 11, 18> has exactly one chord: (7, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <7, 1, (4), 12>
- <19, (7), 11, 18>
