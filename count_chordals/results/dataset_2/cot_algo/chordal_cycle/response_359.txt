Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 2) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 12, 14, 6> with edges (0, 12), (12, 14), (14, 6), (6, 0)
- Cycle 2: <1, 13, 4, 12> with edges (1, 13), (13, 4), (4, 12), (12, 1)
- Cycle 3: <1, 13, 14, 5> with edges (1, 13), (13, 14), (14, 5), (5, 1)
- Cycle 4: <2, 9, 10, 6> with edges (2, 9), (9, 10), (10, 6), (6, 2)
- Cycle 5: <3, 10, 9, 8> with edges (3, 10), (10, 9), (9, 8), (8, 3)
- Cycle 6: <4, 12, 5, 11> with edges (4, 12), (12, 5), (5, 11), (11, 4)
- Cycle 7: <5, 14, 13, 1> with edges (5, 14), (14, 13), (13, 1), (1, 5)
- Cycle 8: <7, 1, 13, 8> with edges (7, 1), (1, 13), (13, 8), (8, 7)
- Cycle 9: <7, 11, 5, 2> with edges (7, 11), (11, 5), (5, 2), (2, 7)

Step 2: Check for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 1).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (5, 13).
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has a chord (13, 5).
- Cycle 8 has a chord (8, 1).
- Cycle 9 has a chord (7, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [4] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 13, 4, 12>
<1, 13, 14, 5>
<7, 1, 13, 8>
<7, 11, 5, 2>
