Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 24) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 21) (3, 0) (6, 25) (6, 19) (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 16) (18, 22) (18, 27) (18, 17) (26, 9) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 8) (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 20) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 23) (29, 24) (29, 11) (23, 22) (23, 29) (23, 28) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 14) (28, 26) (28, 23) (28, 12) (28, 17) (21, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 29) (24, 4) (11, 26) (11, 29) (11, 14) (11, 19) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (5, 25) (5, 16) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 20) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 4) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 0) (17, 4) (8, 26) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 25) (16, 9) (16, 5) (27, 18) (4, 24) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 17) (20, 2) (20, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<1, 7, 12, 28, 9>
<2, 20, 19, 6, 25>
<3, 22, 29, 11, 26>
<4, 17, 0, 3, 21>
<8, 10, 1, 2, 29>
<11, 19, 6, 25, 8>
<12, 28, 17, 0, 4>
<16, 5, 25, 9, 26>
<18, 27, 26, 9, 25>
<23, 22, 18, 27, 26>
<24, 2, 29, 23, 22>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The unique chordal 4-cycle is:
<2, 20, 19, 6> (chord: 25)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are a total of 10 chordless cycles. So, the final count is [10].
