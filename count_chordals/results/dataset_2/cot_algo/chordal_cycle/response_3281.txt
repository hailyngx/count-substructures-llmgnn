Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 13) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 14) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 1) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 13 - 5 - 6
2. Cycle 2: 8 - 2 - 11 - 10 - 8
3. Cycle 3: 8 - 13 - 9 - 6 - 8
4. Cycle 4: 8 - 1 - 4 - 12 - 8
5. Cycle 5: 13 - 9 - 8 - 2 - 13
6. Cycle 6: 13 - 5 - 11 - 14 - 13
7. Cycle 7: 10 - 4 - 12 - 1 - 10
8. Cycle 8: 10 - 11 - 14 - 4 - 10
9. Cycle 9: 4 - 14 - 12 - 1 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has a chord: 9 - 13
- Cycle 2 has a chord: 2 - 11
- Cycle 3 has a chord: 9 - 13
- Cycle 4 has a chord: 1 - 12
- Cycle 5 has a chord: 8 - 2
- Cycle 6 has a chord: 5 - 11
- Cycle 7 has no chord.
- Cycle 8 has no chord.
- Cycle 9 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<6, (9, 13), 5)>
<8, (2, 11), 10)>
<13, (5, 11), 14)>
