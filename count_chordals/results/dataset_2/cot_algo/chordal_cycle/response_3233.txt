Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <4, 7, 2, 6>
        - <4, 6, 3, 26>
        - <4, 6, 22, 18>
        - <4, 21, 19, 17>
        - <5, 25, 8, 4>
        - <5, 25, 11, 18>
        - <5, 2, 7, 23>
        - <7, 4, 6, 22>
        - <7, 23, 26, 3>
        - <9, 15, 26, 24>
        - <10, 18, 22, 16>
        - <10, 26, 3, 6>
        - <10, 26, 24, 12>
        - <10, 0, 29, 1>
        - <11, 18, 22, 16>
        - <11 ,25, 5, 4>
        - <12, 24, 26, 3>
        - <15, 24, 12, 17>
        - <15, 9, 15, 26>
        - <16, 22, 6, 4>
        - <16, 17 ,12, 24>
        - <16, 1 ,27 ,10>
        - <18, 22, 6, 4>
        - <18, 11, 25, 8>
        - <18, 28, 3, 6>
        - <18, 10, 27, 1>
        - <19, 21, 4, 6>
        - <20, 7, 23, 26>
        - <21, 19, 17, 12>
        - <28, 18, 10, 27>
       
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord: 
        - From the list above, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
        <5, 25, 8, 4, (5,8)>
        <18, 28, 3, 6, (18,3)>
        <20, 7, 23, 26, (7, 23)>
       
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
        There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [3].
