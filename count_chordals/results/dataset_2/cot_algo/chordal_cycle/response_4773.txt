Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 19) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 2) (6, 5) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 18) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 0) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 1) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 11) (12, 13) (12, 18) (19, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 18) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 14, 15, 3, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 6, 2, 15, 14, 0, 11, 4, 17, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 2, 15, 14, 10, 8, 1, 11, 0, 5)

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
- For Cycle 1: Chord (14, 3)
- For Cycle 2: Chord (6, 15)
- For Cycle 3: Chord (10, 1)

Step 3:
Count of chordless 4-cycles: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 9, (14, 3), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 6, (2, 15), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 6, (2, 15), 14, 10, (1, 11), 0>
