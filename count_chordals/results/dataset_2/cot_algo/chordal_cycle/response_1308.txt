Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 4) (16, 15) (5, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 16) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 18) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 18) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (19, 1) (19, 10) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 12, 1> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 16, 15, 12> 
- Cycle 3: <1, 17, 14, 13, 5> 
- Cycle 4: <1, 12, 6, 9, 8> 
- Cycle 5: <1, 18, 13, 14, 17> 
- Cycle 6: <2, 14, 13, 5, 13> 
- Cycle 7: <2, 3, 8, 9, 0> 
- Cycle 8: <3, 8, 11, 7, 6> 
- Cycle 9: <4, 16, 15, 10, 1> 
- Cycle 10: <6, 7, 3, 8, 9> 
- Cycle 11: <6, 12, 14, 17, 11> 
- Cycle 12: <7, 11, 8, 9, 6> 
- Cycle 13: <10, 1, 12, 6, 7> 
- Cycle 14: <12, 15, 16, 4, 0> 
- Cycle 15: <13, 5, 3, 7, 11> 
- Cycle 16: <14, 17, 11, 8, 3> 
- Cycle 17: <14, 18, 1, 10, 15> 
- Cycle 18: <15, 10, 1, 18, 13> 
- Cycle 19: <16, 4, 0, 2, 3> 
- Cycle 20: <17, 14, 12, 6, 7> 

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 12, 1>; Chord: (6, 12)
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 16, 15, 12>; Chord: (4, 15)
- Cycle 3: <1, 17, 14, 13, 5>; Chord: (17, 13)
- Cycle 4: <1, 12, 6, 9, 8>; Chord: (12, 9)
- Cycle 5: <6, 7, 3, 8, 9>; Chord: (7, 8)

Step 3:
There are a total of [5] chordal 4-cycles found.
