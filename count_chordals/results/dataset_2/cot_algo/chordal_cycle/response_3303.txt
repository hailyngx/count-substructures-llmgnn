Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 9, 7, 0) with chords (9, 7) and (5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 8, 12, 0) with chords (5, 8) and (8, 12)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 3, 2, 0) with chords (5, 3) and (3, 2)
- Cycle 4: (0, 13, 2, 3, 0) with chords (13, 2) and (2, 3)
- Cycle 5: (0, 13, 8, 5, 0) with chords (13, 8) and (8, 5)
- Cycle 6: (0, 7, 11, 4, 0) with chords (7, 11) and (11, 4)
- Cycle 7: (0, 6, 3, 2, 0) with chords (6, 3) and (3, 2)
- Cycle 8: (0, 6, 7, 9, 0) with chords (6, 7) and (7, 9)
- Cycle 9: (1, 4, 11, 7, 1) with chords (4, 11) and (11, 7)
- Cycle 10: (2, 3, 6, 7, 2) with chords (3, 6) and (6, 7)
- Cycle 11: (2, 4, 14, 5, 2) with chords (4, 14) and (14, 5)
- Cycle 12: (2, 12, 8, 13, 2) with chords (12, 8) and (8, 13)
- Cycle 13: (4, 14, 7, 9, 4) with chords (14, 7) and (7, 9)
- Cycle 14: (5, 14, 4, 11, 5) with chords (14, 4) and (4, 11)
- Cycle 15: (8, 10, 12, 2, 8) with chords (10, 12) and (12, 2)
- Cycle 16: (9, 14, 4, 1, 9) with chords (14, 4) and (4, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Out of the 16 cycles listed above, cycles 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16 have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

As stated above, there are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 5, 9, 7>
<0, 5, 8, 12>
<0, 13, 2, 3>
<0, 13, 8, 5>
<0, 7, 11, 4>
<0, 6, 3, 2>
<0, 6, 7, 9>
<1, 4, 11, 7>
<2, 3, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 14, 5>
<2, 12, 8, 13>
<4, 14, 7, 9>
<8, 10, 12, 2>
