        - Cycle 21: 11-12-0-6-11
        - Cycle 22: 13-14-3-5-13
        - Cycle 23: 8-12-0-6-8
        - Cycle 24: 1-6-9-7-1
        - Cycle 25: 1-6-2-7-1
        - Cycle 26: 1-6-5-7-1
        - Cycle 27: 1-6-0-4-1
        - Cycle 28: 3-0-6-9-3
        - Cycle 29: 3-0-6-2-3
        - Cycle 30: 3-0-6-5-3

        - Cycle 33: 5-7-2-6-5
        - Cycle 34: 5-7-2-1-5
        - Cycle 35: 5-7-2-1-5
        - Cycle 36: 5-7-2-0-5
        - Cycle 37: 5-3-0-6-5
        - Cycle 38: 5-3-0-1-5
        - Cycle 39: 5-3-14-13-5

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - <4, (11, 10), 13, 8>
        - <4, (14, 13), 11, 12>
        - <7, (6, 9), 2, 1>
        - <7, (6, 5), 2, 1>
        - <7, (6, 0), 2, 1>
        - <7, (2, 1), 6, 5>
        - <10, (8, 13), 11, 12>
        - <11, (12, 14), 13, 8>
        - <13, (14, 3), 11, 12>
        - <1, (6, 9), 7, 2>
        - <1, (6, 5), 7, 2>
        - <1, (6, 0), 7, 2>
        - <3, (0, 6), 5, 7>
        - <3, (0, 1), 5, 7>
        - <3, (14, 13), 8, 12>
        - <5, (7, 2), 6, 1>
        - <5, (7, 2), 6, 1>
        - <5, (3, 0), 6, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
        There are 39 cycles and 17 of them have exactly one chord. 
        So the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [22].
