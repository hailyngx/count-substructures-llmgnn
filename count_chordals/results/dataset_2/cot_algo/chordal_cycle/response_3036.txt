Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 18) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 12) (2, 12) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (19, 5) (19, 0) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 7) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 12) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 14) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:

1. (4, 11, 18, 4)
2. (7, 10, 13, 17, 7)
3. (9, 5, 19, 0, 9)
4. (9, 14, 3, 7, 9)
5. (15, 12, 2, 18, 15)
6. (15, 1, 7, 10, 15)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. (4, 11, 18, 4) - Chord (11, 18)
2. (7, 10, 13, 17, 7) - Chord (10, 13)
3. (15, 12, 2, 18, 15) - Chord (12, 18)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<4, 11, 18, 4> (Chord: (11, 18))
<7, 10, 13, 17, 7> (Chord: (10, 13))
<15, 12, 2, 18, 15> (Chord: (12, 18))
