Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 2) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 14) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (6, 11, 10, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 2: (6, 11, 14, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 3: (6, 3, 12, 7, 6)
        - Cycle 4: (6, 4, 8, 14, 6)
        - Cycle 5: (10, 11, 12, 7, 10)
        - Cycle 6: (10, 4, 8, 14, 10)
        - Cycle 7: (11, 6, 4, 10, 11)
        - Cycle 8: (11, 10, 2, 5, 11)
        - Cycle 9: (11, 14, 3, 12, 11)
        - Cycle 10: (4, 10, 2, 5, 4)
        - Cycle 11: (4, 10, 1, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 12: (4, 6, 13, 9, 4)
        - Cycle 13: (4, 5, 14, 8, 4)
        - Cycle 14: (8, 4, 10, 2, 8)
        - Cycle 15: (8, 14, 3, 12, 8)
        - Cycle 16: (7, 12, 3, 14, 7)
        - Cycle 17: (7, 0, 1, 10, 7)
        - Cycle 18: (12, 7, 1, 10, 12)
        - Cycle 19: (0, 7, 12, 3, 0)
        - Cycle 20: (0, 14, 5, 2, 0)
        - Cycle 21: (14, 11, 3, 12, 14)
        - Cycle 22: (5, 14, 3, 12, 5)
        - Cycle 23: (3, 12, 7, 0, 3)
        - Cycle 24: (2, 10, 1, 7, 2)
        - Cycle 25: (13, 6, 4, 5, 13)
        - Cycle 26: (1, 10, 4, 6, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, (10, 4), 11>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, (11, 14), 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, (3, 12), 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <10, (11, 12), 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, (10, 2), 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <10, (4, 8), 14>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, (6, 13), 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (4, 10), 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <8, (14, 3), 12>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <12, (7, 1), 10>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <0, (7, 12), 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <14, (5, 2), 0>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <5, (14, 3), 12>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 14: <3, (12, 7), 0>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 15: <2, (10, 1), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are 25 cycles, and 15 of them are chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [10].
