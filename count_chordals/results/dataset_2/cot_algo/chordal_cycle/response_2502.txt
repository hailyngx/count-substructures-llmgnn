Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: (2, 29, 9, 4, 13, 2)
        - Cycle 2: (2, 29, 12, 3, 11, 22, 6, 19, 15, 20, 2)
        - Cycle 3: (2, 29, 12, 16, 18, 4, 13, 2)
        - Cycle 4: (2, 29, 9, 18, 16, 12, 3, 11, 22, 6, 19, 15, 20, 2)
        - Cycle 5: (2, 29, 12, 3, 11, 22, 28, 7, 19, 15, 20, 2)
        - Cycle 6: (2, 29, 9, 18, 16, 12, 5, 25, 23, 4, 13, 2)
        - Cycle 7: (2, 29, 12, 3, 11, 22, 6, 19, 7, 28, 22, 11, 5, 10, 26, 15, 20, 2)
        - Cycle 8: (2, 29, 12, 16, 18, 4, 23, 0, 15, 20, 2)
        - Cycle 9: (2, 29, 9, 18, 4, 23, 25, 5, 12, 3, 11, 22, 6, 19, 15, 20, 2)
        - Cycle 10: (2, 29, 9, 23, 0, 15, 19, 6, 22, 11, 12, 16, 18, 4, 13, 2)
        - Cycle 11: (2, 29, 9, 18, 4, 23, 0, 15, 20, 1, 19, 6, 22, 11, 12, 16, 2)
        - Cycle 12: (2, 29, 12, 3, 11, 22, 28, 7, 14, 25, 5, 10, 26, 17, 27, 8, 2)
        - Cycle 13: (29, 9, 18, 16, 12, 3, 11, 22, 6, 19, 15, 20, 2, 10, 26, 17, 27, 8, 7, 28, 22)

Step 2: Checking for chords:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (12, 16), 13)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (3, 11), 22)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (4, 13), 2)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (18, 16), 12)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (10, 26), 15)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (19, 7), 28)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (14, 25), 5)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (17, 27), 2)>

Step 3: Counting chordless cycles:
        There are 13 cycles, and 8 of them are chordal 4-cycles.
        Thus, the number of chordless 4-cycles is [5].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        - <1, (12, 16), 13)>
        - <2, (3, 11), 22)>
        - <3, (4, 13), 2)>
        - <4, (18, 16), 12)>
        - <5, (10, 26), 15)>
        - <6, (19, 7), 28)>
        - <7, (14, 25), 5)>
        - <8, (17, 27), 2)>
