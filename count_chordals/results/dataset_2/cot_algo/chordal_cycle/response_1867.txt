Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 4) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 18) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 12) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 12) (10, 16) (10, 3) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 12) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (18, 6) (18, 14) (13, 1) (13, 7) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, but we will focus on cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (11, 9, 12, 0, 4, 16, 10, 3, 6), length 8
- Cycle 2: (11, 9, 6, 3, 1, 13, 7, 17, 19), length 8
- Cycle 3: (11, 9, 6, 2, 19, 17, 5, 15, 12), length 8
- Cycle 4: (16, 4, 0, 12, 5, 17, 7, 15, 14), length 8
- Cycle 5: (4, 16, 10, 3, 1, 13, 7, 17, 19), length 8
- Cycle 6: (17, 19, 2, 6, 3, 10, 16, 4, 8), length 8
- Cycle 7: (17, 5, 15, 7, 13, 1, 3, 6, 9), length 8
- Cycle 8: (12, 0, 4, 8, 11, 2, 19, 17, 7), length 8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

After checking each cycle, we find that only Cycle 6: (17, 19, 2, 6, 3, 10, 16, 4, 8) has exactly one chord (2, 16).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord in this graph is [1].

List of the unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<17, 19, (2, 16), 4>
