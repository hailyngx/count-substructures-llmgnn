Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (9, 1) (9, 8) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-6-2-1 (chords: 3-2)
- Cycle 2: 1-9-8-0-1 (chords: 9-8)
- Cycle 3: 0-8-11-1-0 (chords: 8-1)
- Cycle 4: 0-8-11-6-0 (chords: 8-6)
- Cycle 5: 0-14-5-10-0 (chords: 14-5)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: <1, (3, 2), 6)>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: <1, (9, 8), 0)>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: <0, (8, 1), 11)>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: <0, (8, 6), 11)>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: <0, (14, 5), 10)>

Step 3:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [5].
