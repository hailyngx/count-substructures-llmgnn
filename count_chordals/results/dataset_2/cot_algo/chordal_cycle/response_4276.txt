Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 1, 7, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 7, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 6, 8, 4, 0, 5>
- Cycle 4: <8, 9, 7, 1, 6, 8>
- Cycle 5: <8, 9, 7, 3, 6, 8>
- Cycle 6: <8, 9, 6, 1, 7, 8>
- Cycle 7: <8, 9, 6, 3, 7, 8>
- Cycle 8: <0, 9, 7, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 9: <0, 9, 7, 3, 6, 0>
- Cycle 10: <0, 9, 6, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle 11: <0, 9, 6, 3, 7, 0>
- Cycle 12: <0, 8, 6, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle 13: <0, 8, 6, 3, 7, 0>
- Cycle 14: <0, 8, 4, 2, 3, 0>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 6, 1, 7, 5> has one chord (6, 7)
- <5, 9, 7, 3, 6, 5> has one chord (9, 3)
- <5, 9, 6, 8, 4, 0, 5> has one chord (6, 4)
- <0, 9, 6, 1, 7, 0> has one chord (6, 7)
- <0, 9, 6, 3, 7, 0> has one chord (9, 3)
- <0, 8, 4, 2, 3, 0> has one chord (4, 2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are 11 chordless cycles found. So, the final count is [11]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <5, 9, 6, 1, 7, 5>
- <5, 9, 7, 3, 6, 5>
- <5, 9, 6, 8, 4, 0, 5>
