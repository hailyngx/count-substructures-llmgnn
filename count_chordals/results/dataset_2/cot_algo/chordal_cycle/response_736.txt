Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 5) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 12) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 1) (7, 12) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 4) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 9) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 6) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 5) (19, 2) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 11) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 16) (16, 2) (16, 6) (16, 4) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <14, 17, 2, 18, 12, 7, 1>
- Cycle 2: <8, 9, 13, 17, 15, 10, 1, 7, 12, 0>
- Cycle 3: <5, 3, 6, 16, 2, 17, 15, 11>
- Cycle 4: <4, 10, 15, 11, 5, 18, 12, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (2, 12)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (9, 15)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (3, 16)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (10, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [4].
