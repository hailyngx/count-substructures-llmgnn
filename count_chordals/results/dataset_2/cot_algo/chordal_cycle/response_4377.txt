Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (4, 1) (4, 6) (18, 11) (18, 0) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 16) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 11) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 12) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 12) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 15) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 10) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 6, 12)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 6, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 6, 12, 16)
- Cycle 4: (1, 4, 6, 0, 8)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 6, 12, 16, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

After checking the cycles, we find that Cycle 2: (1, 4, 6, 0) contains exactly one chord (1, 6).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, 4, 6, 0>
