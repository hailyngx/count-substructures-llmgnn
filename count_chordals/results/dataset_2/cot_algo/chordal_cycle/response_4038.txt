This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 25) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 28) (7, 0) (7, 22) (6, 28) (6, 26) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 10) (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 29) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 23) (28, 4) (28, 6) (28, 25) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 29) (17, 5) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 15) (29, 22) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 14) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 21) (8, 18) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 24) (10, 23) (19, 8) (19, 2) (5, 17) (5, 2) (26, 6) (26, 2) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 5) (2, 26) (24, 3) (24, 10) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 20) (14, 13) (20, 14) (20, 21) (23, 3) (23, 27) (23, 15) (23, 10) (21, 8) (21, 20) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 25) (25, 16) (25, 28) (25, 13) (18, 8) (22, 7) (22, 1) (22, 29)

        - Cycle 3: (1, 12, 16, 25, 13)
        - Cycle 4: (1, 12, 2, 5, 17)
        - Cycle 5: (1, 22, 7, 0, 6)
        - Cycle 6: (1, 22, 29, 17, 5)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 23, 27, 12, 16)
        - Cycle 8: (3, 23, 27, 12, 1)

        - Cycle 12: (8, 9, 10, 23, 27)
        - Cycle 13: (8, 9, 17, 11, 16)
        - Cycle 14: (8, 9, 17, 5, 2)
        - Cycle 15: (8, 19, 2, 12, 16)
        - Cycle 16: (8, 21, 20, 14, 13)
        - Cycle 17: (10, 9, 8, 19, 2)
        - Cycle 18: (10, 9, 17, 5, 2)
        - Cycle 19: (10, 15, 1, 12, 16)
        - Cycle 20: (10, 15, 14, 20, 21)
        - Cycle 21: (14, 20, 21, 8, 18)
        - Cycle 22: (14, 3, 24, 10, 9)
        - Cycle 23: (15, 1, 12, 16, 25)
        - Cycle 24: (15, 29, 3, 14, 13)
        - Cycle 25: (15, 29, 22, 1, 12)
        - Cycle 26: (17, 11, 16, 25, 13)
        - Cycle 27: (17, 5, 2, 12, 16)

        - Cycle 32: (25, 13, 14, 20, 21)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - <4, 13, 25, 16, 12> (Chord: (13, 16))
        - <10, 9, 8, 19, 2> (Chord: (8, 19))
        - <15, 29, 3, 14, 13> (Chord: (29, 3))
        - <17, 29, 3, 14, 13> (Chord: (29, 3))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are [28] chordless cycles in the graph.
