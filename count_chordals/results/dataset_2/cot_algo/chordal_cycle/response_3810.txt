Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, 15, 0, 7> (Chord: (0, 15))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <15, 0, 7, 10> (Chord: (7, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <15, 0, 16, 18> (Chord: (16, 18))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, 19, 8, 1> (Chord: (8, 19))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <8, 1, 5, 12> (Chord: (1, 5))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <16, 18, 11, 6> (Chord: (11, 18))
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <2, 7, 0, 15> (Chord: (0, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, 8, 19, 16> (Chord: (8, 19))
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <6, 11, 15, 3> (Chord: (3, 15))
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <14, 6, 11, 15> (Chord: (11, 15))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 50 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [10].
