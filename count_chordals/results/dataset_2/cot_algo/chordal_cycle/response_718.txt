Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-6-8-9-4-0
- Cycle 2: 1-2-7-6-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-7-4-3-1
- Cycle 4: 2-9-8-6-7-2
- Cycle 5: 3-4-7-6-3
- Cycle 6: 3-8-9-2-0-3

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord, which is (1, 7). This makes it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, (1, 7), 4>
