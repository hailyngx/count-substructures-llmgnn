This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 9, 0, 6) with edges (1, 9), (9, 0), (0, 6), (6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 12, 5, 3) with edges (1, 12), (12, 5), (5, 3), (3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 8, 2, 4) with edges (1, 8), (8, 2), (2, 4), (4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 14, 13) with edges (1, 8), (8, 14), (14, 13), (13, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 7, 2, 4) with edges (3, 7), (7, 2), (2, 4), (4, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 10, 0, 6) with edges (3, 10), (10, 0), (0, 6), (6, 3)
- Cycle 7: (5, 6, 0, 14) with edges (5, 6), (6, 0), (0, 14), (14, 5)

- Cycle 9: (6, 0, 14, 13) with edges (6, 0), (0, 14), (14, 13), (13, 6)
- Cycle 10: (9, 1, 12, 5) with edges (9, 1), (1, 12), (12, 5), (5, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 0, 10, 3) with edges (9, 0), (0, 10), (10, 3), (3, 9)
- Cycle 12: (9, 11, 5, 3) with edges (9, 11), (11, 5), (5, 3), (3, 9)
- Cycle 13: (10, 3, 4, 2) with edges (10, 3), (3, 2), (2, 4), (4, 10)
- Cycle 14: (10, 0, 12, 5) with edges (10, 0), (0, 12), (12, 5), (5, 10)
- Cycle 15: (11, 5, 12, 1) with edges (11, 5), (5, 12), (12, 1), (1, 11)
- Cycle 16: (11, 6, 0, 14) with edges (11, 6), (6, 0), (0, 14), (14, 11)
- Cycle 17: (13, 14, 0, 6) with edges (13, 14), (14, 0), (0, 6), (6, 13)
- Cycle 18: (14, 4, 2, 7) with edges (14, 4), (4, 2), (2, 7), (7, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 <1, (9, 6), 0> has one chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 2 <1, (12, 5), 3> has one chord (12, 5)
- Cycle 3 <1, (8, 4), 2> has one chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 4 <1, (8, 13), 14> has one chord (8, 13)
- Cycle 5 <7, (3, 4), 2> has one chord (3, 4)
- Cycle 6 <10, (3, 6), 0> has one chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 7 <5, (6, 14), 0> has one chord (6, 14)
- Cycle 8 <12, (5, 8), 1> has one chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 9 <13, (6, 14), 0> has one chord (6, 14)
- Cycle 10 <9, (1, 12), 5> has one chord (1, 12)
- Cycle 11 <0, (9, 10), 3> has one chord (9, 10)
- Cycle 12 <9, (11, 5), 3> has one chord (11, 5)
- Cycle 13 <10, (3, 2), 4> has one chord (3, 2)
- Cycle 14 <0, (10, 12), 5> has one chord (10, 12)
- Cycle 15 <11, (5, 12), 1> has one chord (5, 12)
- Cycle 16 <14, (6, 0), 11> has one chord (6, 0)
- Cycle 17 <13, (14, 6), 0> has one chord (14, 6)
- Cycle 18 <4, (14, 2), 7> has one chord (14, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 18 unique chordal 4-cycles found in this graph. Therefore, the final count is [18].
