Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 15) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 6) (2, 11) (12, 15) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more with all existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (3, 7, 13, 8, 6, 7)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (13, 8) connecting non-adjacent vertices 13 and 8

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, (13, 8), 6>
