Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges are:
- Cycles of length 4: (5, 9, 8, 10), (5, 9, 13, 4), (5, 4, 13, 10), (5, 4, 14, 6), (5, 12, 0, 11), (5, 12, 6, 14), (9, 8, 10, 7), (9, 8, 1, 2), (9, 3, 13, 4), (9, 3, 7, 6), (4, 13, 10, 7), (4, 10, 8, 6), (8, 10, 7, 3), (8, 10, 2, 1), (0, 12, 6, 11), (0, 12, 3, 13), (0, 11, 2, 10), (0, 11, 13, 3), (10, 7, 3, 13), (10, 2, 1, 8), (12, 6, 11, 0), (12, 3, 7, 6), (11, 2, 1, 8), (11, 6, 14, 5), (14, 6, 12, 5), (3, 7, 10, 4), (7, 6, 12, 3)
- Cycles of length 5: (5, 9, 8, 10, 4), (5, 9, 13, 3, 4), (5, 4, 13, 10, 7), (5, 4, 14, 6, 12), (5, 12, 0, 11, 2), (9, 8, 10, 7, 3), (4, 13, 10, 7, 3), (8, 10, 7, 3, 13), (0, 12, 6, 11, 2), (10, 7, 3, 13, 9), (12, 6, 11, 0, 5), (3, 7, 10, 4, 13)

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle is:
<5, 9, 8, 10> with the chord (8, 10)

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
