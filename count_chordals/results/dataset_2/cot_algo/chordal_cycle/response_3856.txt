Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 17, 11, 21>
- <0, 17, 27, 29>
- <14, 17, 27, 29>
- <4, 18, 27, 29>
- <15, 20, 23, 27>
- <9, 15, 20, 21>
- <9, 15, 25, 19>
- <9, 0, 17, 27>
- <9, 0, 16, 24>
- <9, 0, 22, 28>
- <9, 0, 1, 28>
- <9, 1, 13, 12>
- <9, 1, 13, 12>
- <9, 1, 2, 24>
- <9, 21, 11, 17>
- <9, 21, 11, 17>
- <9, 21, 20, 23>
- <9, 19, 8, 23>
- <9, 19, 25, 23>
- <9, 19, 25, 15>
- <9, 22, 0, 17>
- <13, 12, 6, 18>
- <13, 12, 6, 18>
- <13, 1, 28, 22>
- <21, 20, 23, 27>


Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 17, 11, 21> (Chord: 11-21)
- <0, 17, 27, 29> (Chord: 27-29)
- <14, 17, 27, 29> (Chord: 17-27)
- <4, 18, 27, 29> (Chord: 18-27)
- <15, 20, 23, 27> (Chord: 20-27)
- <9, 15, 20, 21> (Chord: 15-21)
- <9, 15, 25, 19> (Chord: 15-19)
- <9, 0, 17, 27> (Chord: 0-27)
- <9, 0, 16, 24> (Chord: 0-24)
- <9, 0, 22, 28> (Chord: 0-28)
- <9, 0, 1, 28> (Chord: 0-28)
- <9, 1, 13, 12> (Chord: 1-13)
- <9, 1, 2, 24> (Chord: 1-24)
- <9, 21, 11, 17> (Chord: 11-17)
- <9, 21, 20, 23> (Chord: 20-23)
- <9, 19, 8, 23> (Chord: 8-23)
- <9, 19, 25, 15> (Chord: 19-15)
- <9, 22, 0, 17> (Chord: 0-17)
- <13, 12, 6, 18> (Chord: 12-6)
- <13, 1, 28, 22> (Chord: 1-28)
- <21, 20, 23, 27> (Chord: 20-27)


Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [20].
