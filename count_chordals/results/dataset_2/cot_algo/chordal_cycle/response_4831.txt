Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. 4-7-1-4
2. 4-9-1-4
3. 4-1-7-4
4. 4-1-9-4
5. 7-1-4-7
6. 7-6-2-7
7. 7-2-3-7
8. 1-9-3-1
9. 1-3-2-1
10. 1-0-9-1
11. 3-2-6-3
12. 3-8-9-3
13. 6-9-8-6
14. 6-8-0-6
15. 9-8-0-9
16. 8-6-0-8

Step 2:
From the above cycles, the ones with exactly one chord (forming a chordal 4-cycle) are:
1. <4, (1, 7), 7>
2. <4, (1, 9), 9>
3. <7, (2, 3), 7>
4. <1, (3, 9), 1>
5. <3, (2, 6), 3>
6. <6, (8, 9), 6>
7. <9, (0, 8), 9>
8. <8, (0, 6), 8>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, there are [8] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
