Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 17) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (18, 19) (18, 5) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 9) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 8) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 15) (8, 16) (8, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 12) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (1, 4, 10, 17, 1)
        - Cycle 2: (1, 7, 11, 14, 1)
        - Cycle 3: (1, 7, 11, 8, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (1, 17, 11, 14, 1)
        - Cycle 5: (3, 12, 15, 9, 3)
        - Cycle 6: (4, 10, 17, 11, 4)
        - Cycle 7: (6, 10, 17, 11, 6)
        - Cycle 8: (7, 11, 14, 0, 7)
        - Cycle 9: (9, 15, 19, 18, 9)
        - Cycle 10: (10, 17, 1, 4, 10)
        - Cycle 11: (11, 7, 1, 17, 11)
        - Cycle 12: (12, 3, 19, 15, 12)
        - Cycle 13: (12, 6, 16, 9, 12)
        - Cycle 14: (13, 7, 1, 17, 13)
        - Cycle 15: (14, 11, 7, 1, 14)
        - Cycle 16: (15, 19, 3, 12, 15)
        - Cycle 17: (16, 6, 10, 17, 16)
        - Cycle 18: (16, 7, 1, 4, 16)
        - Cycle 19: (16, 8, 11, 14, 16)
        - Cycle 20: (16, 9, 15, 12, 16)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, (7, 17), 11>
        - <1, (7, 11), 14>
        - <1, (7, 11), 8>
        - <1, (11, 17), 14>
        - <3, (12, 19), 15>
        - <4, (10, 17), 11>
        - <6, (10, 17), 11>
        - <7, (11, 1), 14>
        - <9, (15, 19), 18>
        - <10, (17, 1), 4>
        - <11, (7, 17), 1>
        - <12, (3, 15), 19>
        - <12, (6, 16), 9>
        - <13, (7, 17), 1>
        - <14, (11, 7), 1>
        - <15, (12, 3), 19>
        - <16, (10, 17), 6>
        - <16, (7, 1), 4>
        - <16, (8, 14), 11>
        - <16, (9, 15), 12>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
        
Therefore, the final answer is [20].
