Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph, including:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-6-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-5-8-0
- Cycle 3: 1-2-6-3-1
- Cycle 4: 4-7-8-5-4

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-0 (Chord: 1-4)
- Cycle 2: 0-1-5-0 (Chord: 1-5)
- Cycle 3: 1-2-3-1 (Chord: 2-3)
- Cycle 4: 4-5-8-7 (Chord: 5-8)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Only 1 chordal 4-cycle was found.

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<0, 1, 4, 0> with chord (1, 4).
