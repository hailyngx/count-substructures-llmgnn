Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 14) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Here are the cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 1 - 8 - 13 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 8 - 2 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 8 - 0 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 4 - 11 - 10 - 1
- Cycle 5: 3 - 0 - 6 - 12 - 3
- Cycle 6: 3 - 13 - 8 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 7: 10 - 14 - 6 - 12 - 10
- Cycle 8: 4 - 14 - 6 - 12 - 4

Step 2:
Checking for the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (8, 13)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (8, 2)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (8, 0)
- Cycle 4 has 2 chords: (4, 11)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (0, 6)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (3, 8)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (10, 6)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (6, 12)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
As there are 8 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, the final count is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (8, 13), 7)>
<3, (8, 2), 1)>
<3, (8, 0), 1)>
<4, (4, 11), 10)>
<3, (0, 6), 12)>
<3, (3, 8), 0)>
<10, (10, 6), 12)>
<4, (6, 12), 14)>
