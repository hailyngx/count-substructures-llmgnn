Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 3, 6, 4)
- Cycle 2: (7, 9, 2, 4, 7)
- Cycle 3: (7, 8, 6, 3, 7)
- Cycle 4: (3, 6, 1, 11, 3)
- Cycle 5: (6, 8, 5, 0, 6)
- Cycle 6: (9, 14, 11, 0, 9)
- Cycle 7: (8, 10, 4, 2, 8)
- Cycle 8: (0, 3, 12, 6, 0)
- Cycle 9: (2, 5, 14, 9, 2)
- Cycle 10: (12, 13, 9, 2, 12)
- Cycle 11: (11, 1, 6, 3, 11)
- Cycle 12: (14, 5, 0, 3, 14)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <1, (6, 4), 7>.
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [11].
