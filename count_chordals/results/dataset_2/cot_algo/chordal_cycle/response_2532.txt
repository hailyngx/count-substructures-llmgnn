Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (0, 9, 7, 5, 0)
- (0, 12, 1, 5, 0)
- (1, 8, 3, 12, 1)
- (3, 4, 13, 6, 3)
- (5, 7, 10, 4, 5)
- (6, 13, 12, 9, 6)
- (9, 10, 7, 0, 9)
- (10, 14, 9, 11, 10)
- (12, 3, 4, 13, 12)
- (13, 6, 1, 11, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, (7, 5), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 9 chordless cycles found.

Final answer: [9]
