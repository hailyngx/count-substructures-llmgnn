Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
1. Cycle: 0-2-8-4-0
2. Cycle: 1-6-5-1
3. Cycle: 3-1-6-7-3
4. Cycle: 7-6-5-0-7
5. Cycle: 8-1-3-9-8

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 0-2-8-4-0 has no chords.
- Cycle 1-6-5-1 has no chords.
- Cycle 3-1-6-7-3 has no chords.
- Cycle 7-6-5-0-7 has the chord (0, 5).
- Cycle 8-1-3-9-8 has the chord (1, 9).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [2].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<7, (0, 5), 6)>
<8, (1, 9), 3)>
