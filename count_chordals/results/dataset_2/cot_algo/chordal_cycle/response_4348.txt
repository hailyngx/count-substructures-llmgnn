Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 0, 4)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 6, 4)
- Cycle 4: (5, 8, 3, 9)
- Cycle 5: (5, 2, 6, 7)
- Cycle 6: (5, 1, 0, 4, 9)
- Cycle 7: (5, 1, 0, 4, 6)
- Cycle 8: (5, 1, 0, 4, 7)
- Cycle 9: (5, 1, 0, 4, 8)
- Cycle 10: (5, 1, 0, 4, 8, 3)
- Cycle 11: (5, 7, 6, 4, 9)
- Cycle 12: (5, 7, 6, 4, 0)

Step 2:
Checking cycles for a chord:
- <1, (5, 0), 4> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (5, 0).

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [11]
