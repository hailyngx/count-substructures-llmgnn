        - Cycle 23: 1-6-8-5-1
        - Cycle 24: 3-7-4-9-3
        - Cycle 25: 3-6-1-2-3

Step 2: Identifying the chordal 4-cycles:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (9, 7), 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (2, 6), 8>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (0, 1), 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (8, 6), 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (2, 8), 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, (4, 7), 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, (7, 3), 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, (0, 5), 8>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <7, (3, 6), 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <6, (1, 4), 0>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <6, (3, 7), 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <6, (2, 9), 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <8, (5, 0), 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 14: <8, (6, 3), 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 15: <2, (5, 0), 1>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 16: <2, (9, 4), 1>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 17: <2, (6, 3), 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 18: <0, (5, 9), 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 19: <0, (4, 1), 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 20: <0, (7, 3), 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 21: <0, (3, 4), 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 22: <1, (4, 9), 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 23: <1, (6, 8), 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 24: <3, (7, 4), 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 25: <3, (6, 1), 2>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 25 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
