Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The list of cycles of length 4 or more with every edge in the cycle existing:

1. Cycle: 0 - 1 - 4 - 8 - 0
2. Cycle: 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 0
3. Cycle: 0 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 0
4. Cycle: 0 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 0
5. Cycle: 0 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 3 - 0
6. Cycle: 1 - 4 - 8 - 7 - 1
7. Cycle: 2 - 3 - 0 - 5 - 2
8. Cycle: 2 - 3 - 4 - 1 - 2

Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 8).
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 3).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (0, 4).
- Cycle 4 has a chord (0, 1).
- Cycle 5 has two chords, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 6 has a chord (1, 8).
- Cycle 7 has a chord (0, 5).
- Cycle 8 has a chord (3, 1).

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 1, 4, 8, (1, 8)>
<0, 1, 2, 3, (1, 3)>
<0, 2, 3, 4, (0, 4)>
<0, 2, 1, 4, (0, 1)>
<1, 4, 8, 7, (1, 8)>
<2, 3, 0, 5, (0, 5)>
