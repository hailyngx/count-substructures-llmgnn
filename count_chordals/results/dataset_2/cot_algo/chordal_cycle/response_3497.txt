Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 2) (4, 18) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 14) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 17) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (1, 6) (3, 19) (3, 12) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 15) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 15) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 17) (10, 8) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
    - Cycle 1: <11, 16, 6, 5, 11>
    - Cycle 2: <11, 16, 13, 2, 11>
    - Cycle 3: <11, 5, 14, 15, 11>
    - Cycle 4: <16, 13, 2, 8, 16>
    - Cycle 5: <16, 6, 5, 14, 16>
    - Cycle 6: <6, 5, 14, 15, 6>
    - Cycle 7: <6, 16, 13, 12, 6>
    - Cycle 8: <6, 16, 11, 5, 6>
    - Cycle 9: <6, 5, 11, 19, 6>
    - Cycle 10: <6, 1, 0, 15, 6>
    - Cycle 11: <6, 1, 0, 2, 6>
    - Cycle 12: <6, 18, 17, 9, 6>
    - Cycle 13: <9, 6, 16, 11, 9>
    - Cycle 14: <9, 14, 5, 11, 9>
    - Cycle 15: <9, 17, 18, 4, 9>
    - Cycle 16: <8, 2, 13, 12, 8>
    - Cycle 17: <8, 2, 0, 15, 8>
    - Cycle 18: <8, 14, 5, 11, 8>
    - Cycle 19: <13, 16, 6, 1, 13>
    - Cycle 20: <13, 2, 0, 15, 13>
    - Cycle 21: <4, 18, 6, 16, 4>
    - Cycle 22: <5, 6, 16, 13, 5>
    - Cycle 23: <5, 11, 16, 6, 5>
    - Cycle 24: <5, 14, 15, 0, 5>
    - Cycle 25: <5, 14, 8, 2, 5>
    - Cycle 26: <18, 6, 16, 13, 18>
    - Cycle 27: <18, 17, 9, 14, 18>
    - Cycle 28: <18, 4, 18>
    - Cycle 29: <2, 8, 14, 5, 2>
    
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
    - Chordal 4-cycles: 
        - <11, 16, 6, 5, 11> with chord (6, 16)
        - <16, 13, 2, 8, 16> with chord (13, 8)
        - <6, 5, 14, 15, 6> with chord (5, 14)
        - <6, 16, 13, 12, 6> with chord (13, 12)
        - <16, 6, 5, 14, 16> with chord (6, 14)
        - <6, 1, 0, 15, 6> with chord (1, 15)
        - <6, 18, 17, 9, 6> with chord (18, 9)
        - <9, 14, 5, 11, 9> with chord (14, 11)
        - <8, 2, 13, 12, 8> with chord (2, 13)
        - <5, 6, 16, 13, 5> with chord (6, 13)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
    - There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
