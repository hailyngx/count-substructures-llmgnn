Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 10) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (5, 9, 2, 1, 5)
- (5, 9, 10, 8, 5)
- (5, 9, 10, 5, 1)
- (5, 1, 6, 2, 5)
- (5, 1, 2, 9, 5)
- (5, 1, 11, 7, 5)
- (5, 11, 7, 2, 5)
- (5, 11, 6, 1, 5)
- (9, 10, 8, 5, 9)    
- (9, 10, 5, 1, 9)
- (9, 2, 4, 3, 9)
- (4, 7, 12, 13, 4)
- (4, 7, 11, 5, 4)
- (4, 3, 9, 2, 4)
- (7, 12, 13, 2, 7)
- (7, 12, 5, 11, 7)
- (7, 2, 6, 13, 7)
- (7, 2, 9, 3, 7)
- (7, 2, 1, 5, 7)
- (7, 11, 5, 4, 7)
- (6, 1, 5, 11, 6)
- (6, 1, 2, 9, 6)
- (6, 2, 9, 10, 6)
- (8, 10, 9, 3, 8)
- (12, 7, 11, 5, 12)
- (12, 13, 2, 9, 12)
- (0, 5, 1, 11, 0)
- (0, 3, 9, 2, 0)
- (0, 11, 5, 1, 0)
- (1, 6, 2, 9, 1)
- (1, 11, 7, 5, 1)
- (10, 8, 5, 9, 10)
- (11, 7, 2, 9, 11)
- (11, 7, 13, 12, 11)
- (11, 6, 1, 5, 11)
- (3, 9, 2, 4, 3)
- (3, 0, 5, 1, 3)
- (14, 1, 2, 9, 14)
- (14, 3, 9, 10, 14)
- (2, 7, 11, 5, 2)
- (2, 6, 1, 5, 2)
- (2, 1, 14, 3, 2)
- (2, 13, 7, 11, 2)
- (13, 12, 7, 4, 13)
- (13, 6, 1, 5, 13)
- (13, 14, 1, 5, 13)
- (13, 2, 9, 10, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle found:  
<5, 9, 2, 1>   

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 50 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [50].
