Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 24) (13, 27) (22, 14) (22, 29) (22, 25) (1, 21) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 2) (21, 15) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 25) (9, 14) (9, 5) (9, 24) (10, 23) (10, 28) (11, 27) (11, 12) (3, 14) (8, 17) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 15) (12, 11) (12, 24) (12, 0) (12, 26) (27, 13) (27, 11) (27, 19) (27, 6) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 6) (18, 0) (19, 8) (19, 27) (19, 26) (26, 23) (26, 12) (26, 19) (26, 15) (28, 10) (28, 4) (28, 24) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 2) (0, 15) (2, 21) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 25) (7, 20) (25, 22) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 7) (16, 21) (16, 29) (16, 6) (6, 17) (6, 27) (6, 4) (6, 16) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 26) (15, 0) (20, 7) (29, 22) (29, 16) (24, 13) (24, 9) (24, 12) (24, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 13 - 24 - 12 - 27 - 13
- Cycle 2: 22 - 14 - 17 - 6 - 22
- Cycle 3: 22 - 14 - 3 - 2 - 21 - 22
- Cycle 4: 22 - 14 - 3 - 9 - 5 - 22
- Cycle 5: 22 - 25 - 5 - 21 - 22
- Cycle 6: 22 - 25 - 4 - 6 - 27 - 22
- Cycle 7: 1 - 21 - 2 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 8: 14 - 3 - 9 - 24 - 14
- Cycle 9: 17 - 6 - 4 - 28 - 24 - 17
- Cycle 10: 8 - 23 - 12 - 4 - 28 - 8
- Cycle 11: 8 - 23 - 12 - 26 - 19 - 8
- Cycle 12: 27 - 13 - 24 - 12 - 26 - 27

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 2 has one chord: (8, 23)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (14, 22)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (2, 21)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (21, 5)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (14, 27)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (3, 14)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (24, 9)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (23, 12)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (13, 24)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the answer is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <22, 14, 3, 2, 21>
2. <22, 25, 5, 21, 22>
3. <22, 25, 4, 27, 14>
4. <17, 6, 4, 28, 24>
5. <8, 23, 12, 26, 19>
