Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-6-1
- Cycle 2: 0-5-9-6-0
- Cycle 3: 3-4-8-2-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-6-1 has one chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 2: 0-5-9-6-0 has one chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 3: 3-4-8-2-3 has one chord (4, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <1, (9, 6), 5)>
