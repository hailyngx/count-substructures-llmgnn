Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 4, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 6, 8, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 4, 2, 3, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 9, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 9, 6, 8, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 9, 0, 1, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 4, 6, 5) --> Chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 6, 8, 5) --> Chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 1, 0, 5) --> Chord: (1, 0)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 6, 7, 5) --> Chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 5: (5, 4, 2, 3, 5) --> Chord: (2, 3)
- Cycle 6: (5, 9, 7, 2, 5) --> Chord: (7, 2)
- Cycle 7: (5, 9, 6, 8, 5) --> Chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 8: (5, 9, 0, 1, 5) --> Chord: (0, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (1, 6)>
<2, (4, 8)>
<3, (1, 0)>
<4, (6, 7)>
<5, (2, 3)>
<6, (7, 2)>
<7, (6, 8)>
<8, (0, 1)>
