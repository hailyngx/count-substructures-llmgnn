Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: (9, 5, 6, 3, 7, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 7, 2, 29, 5, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 12, 13, 12, 27, 12, 9)
- Cycle 4: (26, 15, 2, 29, 25, 3, 17, 24, 28, 14, 26)
- Cycle 5: (5, 29, 25, 3, 6, 24, 17, 24, 28, 14, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 21, 8, 16, 1, 6, 3, 7, 4, 14, 28, 22, 4, 11, 20, 12, 9, 7, 5)
- Cycle 7: (2, 29, 5, 21, 8, 16, 23, 15, 26, 14, 28, 22, 4, 11, 10, 23, 15, 2)
- Cycle 8: (29, 25, 3, 7, 4, 22, 28, 14, 26, 15, 23, 16, 1, 18, 19, 2)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: <1, (3, 5), 6>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: <2, (5, 29), 9>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (3, 5), 6>
<2, (5, 29), 9>
