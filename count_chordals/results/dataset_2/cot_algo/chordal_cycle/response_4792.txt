Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 12) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 4) (29, 21) (4, 29) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 22) (7, 26) (18, 2) (18, 20) (18, 24) (5, 25) (5, 21) (6, 14) (6, 3) (15, 13) (15, 11) (20, 18) (19, 1) (19, 27) (26, 7) (26, 22) (26, 3) (22, 7) (22, 26) (22, 8) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 23) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 23) (14, 13) (10, 13) (10, 25) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 13) (17, 23) (8, 22) (8, 24) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 27) (21, 29) (21, 5) (21, 9) (21, 23) (25, 5) (25, 10) (25, 16) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 9) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 27) (24, 4) (24, 18) (24, 8) (24, 1) (9, 21) (9, 12) (9, 11) (27, 29) (27, 19) (27, 16) (27, 11) (27, 28) (28, 0) (28, 27) (3, 6) (3, 26) (1, 19) (1, 24) (23, 0) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 2-29-4-7-2
- Cycle 2: 2-18-20-24-2
- Cycle 3: 5-21-9-12-5
- Cycle 4: 6-14-7-22-6
- Cycle 5: 15-13-10-25-15
- Cycle 6: 20-18-24-1-20
- Cycle 7: 26-7-14-13-26
- Cycle 8: 16-4-7-14-16
- Cycle 9: 21-29-27-11-21
- Cycle 10: 25-10-13-12-25
- Cycle 11: 12-2-18-24-12
- Cycle 12: 11-15-13-14-11
- Cycle 13: 24-8-22-7-24
- Cycle 14: 9-21-23-17-9
- Cycle 15: 27-29-4-16-27
- Cycle 16: 28-0-23-14-28
- Cycle 17: 3-6-14-23-3
- Cycle 18: 1-19-27-28-1
- Cycle 19: 25-16-27-11-25

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- The chordal 4-cycle found is <2, (4, 7), 29>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [19].
