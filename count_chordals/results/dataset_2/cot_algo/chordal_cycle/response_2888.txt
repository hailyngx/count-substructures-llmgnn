Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 7) (11, 6) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
        List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

        Cycle 1: 4-9-6-5-4
        Cycle 2: 2-8-4-9-2
        Cycle 3: 2-8-14-7-2
        Cycle 4: 4-14-7-0-4
        Cycle 5: 12-2-8-5-12

Step 2:
        Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:

        - <4, 9, 6, 5> has one chord: (9, 5)
        - <2, 8, 4, 9> has one chord: (8, 9)
        - <2, 8, 14, 7> has one chord: (8, 14)
        - <4, 14, 7, 0> has one chord: (14, 7)
        - <12, 2, 8, 5> has one chord: (2, 8)

Step 3:
        Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 0

Final Result:
        There are no chordless 4-cycles in this graph. So, the final count is [0].
