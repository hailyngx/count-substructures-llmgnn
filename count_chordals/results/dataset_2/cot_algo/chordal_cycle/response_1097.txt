Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
1. Cycle <0, 7, 4, 3>
2. Cycle <1, 4, 7, 0>
3. Cycle <2, 4, 3, 7>
4. Cycle <3, 7, 4, 6>
5. Cycle <4, 2, 8, 4>
6. Cycle <5, 0, 7, 4>
7. Cycle <6, 3, 4, 7>
8. Cycle <9, 1, 4, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
From the listed cycles above, we find the following chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal cycle: <2, 4, 3, 7>, Chord: (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since we found one chordal 4-cycle, the number of chordless cycles is [7].
