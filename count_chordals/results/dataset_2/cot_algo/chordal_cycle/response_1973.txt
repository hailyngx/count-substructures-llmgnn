Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 28) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 16) (1, 21) (1, 2) (21, 1) (21, 0) (21, 22) (21, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 20) (18, 22) (18, 11) (22, 21) (22, 18) (22, 10) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 11) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 20) (17, 10) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 24) (12, 0) (28, 9) (28, 11) (28, 2) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 3) (11, 18) (11, 27) (11, 28) (11, 14) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 7) (13, 0) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 8) (20, 19) (29, 15) (29, 7) (29, 16) (25, 24) (14, 11) (14, 3) (7, 13) (7, 29) (7, 5) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 23) (23, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 19) (2, 1) (2, 21) (2, 28) (24, 12) (24, 13) (24, 25) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 13) (16, 9) (16, 26) (16, 13) (16, 29) (19, 10) (19, 20) (19, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (9, 26, 13, 0, 9)
- Cycle 2: (21, 2, 28, 11, 21)
- Cycle 3: (8, 20, 6, 3, 8)
- Cycle 4: (22, 21, 1, 2, 22)
- Cycle 5: (10, 20, 6, 3, 10)
- Cycle 6: (7, 29, 16, 13, 7)
- Cycle 7: (22, 10, 17, 10, 22)
- Cycle 8: (22, 10, 12, 0, 22)
- Cycle 9: (26, 13, 24, 25, 26)
- Cycle 10: (20, 6, 9, 28, 20)
- Cycle 11: (2, 21, 1, 2, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 has chord (9, 0) <9, (26, 13), 0>
- Cycle 2 has chord (21, 11) <21, (2, 28), 11>
- Cycle 3 has chord (8, 6) <8, (20, 3), 6>
- Cycle 4 has chord (22, 2) <22, (21, 1), 2>
- Cycle 5 has chord (10, 3) <10, (20, 6), 3>
- Cycle 6 has chord (7, 13) <7, (29, 16), 13>
- Cycle 7 has chord (22, 17) <22, (10, 12), 17>
- Cycle 8 has chord (22, 0) <22, (10, 12), 0>
- Cycle 9 has chord (26, 25) <26, (13, 24), 25>
- Cycle 10 has chord (20, 28) <20, (6, 9), 28>
- Cycle 11 has chord (2, 1) <2, (21, 22), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 

We found 0 chordless cycles, so the final count is [0].
