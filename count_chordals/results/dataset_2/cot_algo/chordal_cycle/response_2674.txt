Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
        - Cycle 1: (4, 6, 0, 7, 5, 11) 
        - Cycle 2: (4, 3, 9, 12, 2, 10) 
        - Cycle 3: (4, 11, 10, 2, 6, 13) 
        - Cycle 4: (7, 5, 1, 2, 10, 11) 
        - Cycle 5: (10, 11, 8, 13, 12, 9) 
        - Cycle 6: (11, 8, 13, 6, 4, 2) 
        - Cycle 7: (8, 13, 12, 9, 3, 4) 
        - Cycle 8: (13, 3, 6, 0, 1, 5)

Step 2:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 5, (7, 11), 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, 6, (0, 10), 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, 11, (2, 10), 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, 5, (1, 11), 10>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <8, 13, (6, 12), 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <8, 13, (3, 4), 12>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <11, 8, (6, 13), 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <13, 3, (0, 9), 6>

Step 3:
        Thus, there are a total of [8] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
