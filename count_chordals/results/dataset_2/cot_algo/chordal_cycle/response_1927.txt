Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 11) (27, 17) (27, 19) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 29) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 27) (11, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 26) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 0) (12, 3) (18, 28) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 25) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 5) (28, 20) (9, 28) (9, 22) (9, 17) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 17) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 19) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 14) (17, 27) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 21) (25, 6) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 5) (4, 10) (4, 22) (4, 21) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 28) (5, 24) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 16) (14, 21) (20, 28) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 21) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 20) (21, 17) (21, 4) (21, 14) (21, 20) (19, 27) (19, 7) (0, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:  

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 29, 2, 1)  
- Cycle 2: (5, 2, 11, 27, 15, 5)  
- Cycle 3: (6, 15, 27, 17, 9, 28, 6)  
- Cycle 4: (7, 11, 13, 16, 24, 6, 28, 20, 7)  
- Cycle 5: (5, 1, 14, 16, 24, 6, 15, 5)  
- Cycle 6: (9, 17, 27, 15, 6, 28, 9)  
- Cycle 7: (4, 10, 11, 2, 5, 8, 26, 20, 21, 4)  
- Cycle 8: (0, 13, 11, 2, 29, 3, 14, 16, 7, 19, 27, 17, 22, 4, 21, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 <1, (2, 1), 3, 29, 2> has exactly one chord (2,1).  
- Cycle 2 <5, (27, 15), 6, 11, 2> has exactly one chord (27, 15).  
- Cycle 3 <6, (9, 28), 15, 27, 17> has exactly one chord (9, 28).  
- Cycle 4 <7, (16, 24), 11, 13, 16> has exactly one chord (16, 24).  
- Cycle 5 <5, (14, 1), 1, 3, 29> has exactly one chord (14, 1).  
- Cycle 6 <9, (15, 6), 17, 27, 15> has exactly one chord (15, 6).  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:  
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [6].  

Please note that the cycles listed above are some examples, and there may be additional chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
