Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 5) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 19) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 10) (6, 11) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 13) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 0) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 18) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 4) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 10) (0, 15) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (7, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 5, 9, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 16, 8, 10, 3, 12, 2, 11)
- Cycle 3: (11, 16, 8, 10, 3, 12, 2, 14, 4, 19, 17, 13, 18, 11)
- Cycle 4: (11, 16, 8, 10, 3, 12, 2, 18, 13, 17, 19, 4, 14, 11)
- Cycle 5: (11, 16, 5, 13, 17, 19, 4, 14, 2, 11)
- Cycle 6: (11, 16, 5, 13, 17, 19, 9, 7, 9, 5, 16, 11)
- Cycle 7: (11, 16, 5, 13, 17, 1, 14, 4, 19, 9, 5, 16, 11)
- Other cycles can be obtained by rotating the above cycles.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (2, 4), 5>
- <2, (3, 12), 11>
- <3, (10, 12), 16>
- <4, (17, 19), 14>
- <5, (9, 19), 16>
- <6, (5, 13), 16>
- <7, (13, 17), 5>
- <8, (1, 14), 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

As we have identified 8 unique chordal 4-cycles, the count of chordless cycles is [8].
