Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-9-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-6-3-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-7-6-8-0
- Cycle 4: 1-9-6-8-1
- Cycle 5: 2-1-9-6-2
- Cycle 6: 2-3-6-8-2
- Cycle 7: 2-7-6-3-2
- Cycle 8: 4-1-9-5-4
- Cycle 9: 4-7-6-3-4
- Cycle 10: 4-7-8-6-4
- Cycle 11: 6-3-2-7-6
- Cycle 12: 6-4-1-9-6
- Cycle 13: 6-4-7-8-6
- Cycle 13: 6-7-2-3-6
- Cycle 14: 6-8-1-9-6

Step 2: Finding chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord):
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (1, 9), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (2, 7), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (4, 9), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (1, 9), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, (1, 9), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (3, 8), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, (4, 8), 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [7].
