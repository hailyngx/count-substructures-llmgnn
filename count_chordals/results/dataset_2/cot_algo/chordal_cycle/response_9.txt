Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 9, 6, 1, 5)
- (5, 9, 6, 4, 5)
- (9, 6, 1, 4, 9)
- (6, 1, 4, 8, 6)
- (1, 4, 8, 0, 1)
- (4, 8, 0, 5, 4)
- (8, 0, 5, 7, 8)
- (0, 5, 7, 9, 0)
- (5, 7, 9, 6, 5)
- (7, 9, 6, 3, 7)
- (9, 6, 3, 0, 9)
- (6, 3, 0, 1, 6)
- (3, 0, 1, 6, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle:
- <5, 9, 6, 1, 5> (Chord: (6, 4))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
