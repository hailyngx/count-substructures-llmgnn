Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 1) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 4) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 12) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 19) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 16) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (15, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 10) (0, 4) (11, 9) (11, 7) (3, 19) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <5, 9, 7, 1>
- <6, 9, 7, 1>
- <8, 13, 17, 12>
- <8, 15, 1, 7>
- <2, 5, 9, 7>
- <2, 5, 9, 11>
- <2, 18, 19, 1>
- <2, 18, 6, 9>
- <13, 8, 15, 1>
- <13, 8, 14, 3>
- <18, 6, 16, 13>
- <18, 19, 3, 10>
- <7, 9, 11, 7>
- <7, 9, 6, 18>
- <12, 7, 1, 19>
- <12, 7, 9, 11>
- <1, 8, 13, 17>
- <1, 8, 15, 1>
- <17, 13, 16, 17>
- <19, 18, 2, 5>
- <10, 2, 5, 9>
- <10, 2, 18, 6>
- <3, 19, 1, 8>
- <3, 10, 2, 5>
- <14, 8, 13, 17>
- <16, 6, 18, 19>

Step 2:
Unique Chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, (9, 7), 1>
- <6, (9, 7), 1>
- <8, (13, 17), 12>
- <8, (15, 1), 7>
- <2, (5, 9), 7>
- <2, (18, 6), 9>
- <13, (8, 15), 1>
- <13, (8, 14), 3>
- <18, (6, 16), 13>
- <18, (19, 3), 10>
- <7, (9, 11), 7>
- <7, (9, 6), 18>
- <12, (7, 1), 19>
- <1, (8, 13), 17>
- <1, (8, 15), 1>
- <17, (13, 16), 17>
- <19, (18, 2), 5>
- <10, (2, 5), 9>
- <10, (2, 18), 6>
- <3, (19, 1), 8>
- <14, (8, 13), 17>
- <16, (6, 18), 19>

Step 3:
There are 22 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [22].
