Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (19, 12) (19, 9) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 12) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (18, 10) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 14) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 9) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 9) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 11) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 14) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all edges existing:

- Cycle <3, 15, 10, 2, 13>
- Cycle <3, 15, 6, 12, 1>
- Cycle <3, 15, 6, 0, 10>
- Cycle <3, 15, 6, 12, 4>
- Cycle <3, 15, 10, 18, 0>
- Cycle <3, 15, 10, 2, 17>
- Cycle <3, 13, 8, 16, 7>
- Cycle <15, 10, 0, 9, 19>
- Cycle <15, 10, 2, 17, 7>
- Cycle <15, 6, 12, 1, 11>
- Cycle <8, 13, 17, 7, 16>
- Cycle <8, 13, 17, 2, 14>
- Cycle <8, 5, 11, 1, 12>
- Cycle <8, 5, 11, 9, 19>
- Cycle <13, 17, 2, 14, 7>
- Cycle <13, 2, 10, 18, 0>
- Cycle <5, 11, 1, 12, 6>
- Cycle <5, 11, 9, 16, 7>
- Cycle <19, 12, 1, 11, 9>
- Cycle <17, 13, 8, 5, 11>
- Cycle <17, 13, 2, 10, 0>
- Cycle <4, 12, 1, 11, 9>
- Cycle <12, 6, 0, 10, 18>
- Cycle <18, 10, 0, 9, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

From the list of cycles above, we can see that the following chordal 4-cycle is found:

<8, 13, 2, 10, 0> with a chord (13, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
