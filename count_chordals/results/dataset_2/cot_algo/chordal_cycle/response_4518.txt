Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 4) (10, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 15) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 4) (7, 16) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 5) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 14) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 6) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (6, 19) (6, 15) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 19) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 16) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 15) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 2) (9, 13) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are only a few cycles of length 4 or more in this graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-2-6-19-1
- Cycle 2: 3-17-4-14-3
- Cycle 3: 5-12-10-14-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Among these cycles, Cycle 1: 1-2-6-19-1 and Cycle 2: 3-17-4-14-3 have exactly one chord each.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <3, (4, 14), 17>
