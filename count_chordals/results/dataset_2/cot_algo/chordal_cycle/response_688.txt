Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 1) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 12) (4, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 10) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 16) (16, 9) (16, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 8 - 13 - 15 - 14 - 8
- Cycle 2: 2 - 18 - 11 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 3: 5 - 4 - 7 - 17 - 5
- Cycle 4: 9 - 18 - 2 - 15 - 9
- Cycle 5: 1 - 8 - 14 - 12 - 1
- Cycle 6: 0 - 2 - 15 - 14 - 0
- Cycle 7: 3 - 5 - 7 - 17 - 3
- Cycle 8: 6 - 11 - 18 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 9: 10 - 13 - 15 - 19 - 10
- Cycle 10: 16 - 9 - 18 - 11 - 16
- Cycle 11: 17 - 7 - 10 - 13 - 17
- Cycle 12: 12 - 8 - 1 - 0 - 12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (1, 14).
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (0, 15).
- Cycle 7 has no chords.
- Cycle 8 has no chords.
- Cycle 9 has no chords.
- Cycle 10 has no chords.
- Cycle 11 has no chords.
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (0, 1).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 8 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, 14, 12, 0>
<0, 15, 9, 18>
<2, 18, 11, 6>
<5, 4, 7, 17>
