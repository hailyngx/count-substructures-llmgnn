Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9) - (9, 11) - (11, 5) - (5, 9)
- Cycle 2: (5, 11) - (11, 8) - (8, 1) - (1, 5) - (5, 11)
- Cycle 3: (4, 5) - (5, 2) - (2, 1) - (1, 4) - (4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8) - (8, 7) - (7, 2) - (2, 4) - (4, 8)
- Cycle 5: (7, 2) - (2, 1) - (1, 8) - (8, 7) - (7, 2)
- Cycle 6: (1, 11) - (11, 3) - (3, 14) - (14, 1) - (1, 11)
- Cycle 7: (3, 11) - (11, 8) - (8, 0) - (0, 3) - (3, 11)
- Cycle 8: (3, 6) - (6, 10) - (10, 14) - (14, 3) - (3, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 0) - (0, 9) - (9, 11) - (11, 6) - (6, 0)
- Cycle 10: (8, 11) - (11, 12) - (12, 13) - (13, 8) - (8, 11)
- Cycle 11: (13, 5) - (5, 4) - (4, 8) - (8, 13) - (13, 5)
- Cycle 12: (13, 7) - (7, 8) - (8, 1) - (1, 13) - (13, 7)
- Cycle 13: (0, 9) - (9, 5) - (5, 13) - (13, 0) - (0, 9)
- Cycle 14: (10, 4) - (4, 5) - (5, 2) - (2, 10) - (10, 4)
- Cycle 15: (14, 3) - (3, 11) - (11, 12) - (12, 14) - (14, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 4 has one chord: (4, 2)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (11, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <4, (4, 2), 8, 7>
2. <11, (11, 14), 3, 3>
