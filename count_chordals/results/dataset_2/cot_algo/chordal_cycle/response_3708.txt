        - Cycle 29: (8, 0, 12, 10, 8)
        - Cycle 30: (9, 1, 7, 13, 9)
        - Cycle 31: (9, 3, 11, 14, 9)
        - Cycle 32: (10, 6, 2, 12, 10)

        - Cycle 42: (14, 5, 11, 3, 14)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Unique chordal 4-cycle: <1, (8, 13), 0)> 

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        - There are 41 cycles in total, and only 1 chordal 4-cycle was found. 
        - So, the number of chordless cycles is 41 - 1 = 40.

Putting the final number inside brackets, [40].
