Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 5) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 10) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 12) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 4-6-8-3-4
        - Cycle 2: 4-5-7-1-4
        - Cycle 3: 4-2-14-12-4
        - Cycle 4: 6-8-11-9-6
        - Cycle 5: 6-13-9-1-6
        - Cycle 6: 6-4-5-1-6
        - Cycle 7: 6-13-3-8-6
        - Cycle 8: 6-4-13-9-6
        - Cycle 9: 8-6-4-5-8
        - Cycle 10: 8-3-13-6-8
        - Cycle 11: 8-7-1-9-8
        - Cycle 12: 8-11-9-13-8
        - Cycle 13: 8-7-5-4-8
        - Cycle 14: 11-9-13-3-11
        - Cycle 15: 11-8-7-5-11
        - Cycle 16: 11-2-14-9-11
        - Cycle 17: 11-0-2-4-11
        - Cycle 18: 11-5-4-13-11
        - Cycle 19: 5-1-7-14-5
        - Cycle 20: 5-4-13-10-5
        - Cycle 21: 5-7-14-12-5
        - Cycle 22: 5-11-9-1-5
        - Cycle 23: 5-12-14-2-5
        - Cycle 24: 7-1-9-13-7
        - Cycle 25: 7-5-4-13-7
        - Cycle 26: 7-14-12-10-7
        - Cycle 27: 7-10-12-14-7
        - Cycle 28: 10-9-13-6-10
        - Cycle 29: 10-7-5-11-10
        - Cycle 30: 10-12-14-2-10
        - Cycle 31: 12-14-9-11-12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, (7, 5), 4>
        - <2, (14, 12), 4>
        - <5, (11, 9), 4>
        - <7, (1, 9), 5>
        - <8, (11, 9), 6>
        - <10, (7, 5), 4>
        - <12, (14, 9), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [24]
