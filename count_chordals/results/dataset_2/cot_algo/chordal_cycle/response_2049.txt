Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4: 
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 4, 6)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 3, 0)
- Cycle 4: (9, 6, 4, 8)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 1, 2)
- Cycle 6: (9, 4, 8, 2)
- Cycle 7: (9, 4, 2, 5)
- Cycle 8: (6, 4, 8, 3)
- Cycle 9: (6, 4, 2, 5)
- Cycle 10: (4, 8, 2, 1)
- Cycle 11: (4, 8, 3, 0)
- Cycle 12: (4, 2, 1, 6)

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles: 
- <5, 9, 6, 1> (Chord: (9, 6))
- <5, 9, 4, 6> (Chord: (5, 4))
- <5, 9, 3, 0> (Chord: (5, 3))
- <9, 6, 4, 8> (Chord: (9, 4))
- <9, 6, 1, 2> (Chord: (9, 1))
- <9, 4, 8, 2> (Chord: (8, 2))
- <9, 4, 2, 5> (Chord: (4, 5))
- <6, 4, 8, 3> (Chord: (6, 8))
- <6, 4, 2, 5> (Chord: (6, 2))
- <4, 8, 2, 1> (Chord: (4, 1))

Step 3:
Final count: [10]
