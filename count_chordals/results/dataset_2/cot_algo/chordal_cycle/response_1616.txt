Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 23) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 29) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 23) (6, 26) (9, 22) (9, 12) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 2) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 0) (2, 17) (2, 16) (18, 10) (18, 29) (7, 23) (7, 27) (12, 9) (12, 8) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 27) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 5) (26, 6) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 20) (28, 1) (28, 26) (3, 0) (3, 19) (11, 14) (11, 24) (4, 13) (4, 27) (27, 7) (27, 24) (27, 4) (27, 16) (25, 17) (25, 29) (23, 1) (23, 6) (23, 7) (0, 13) (0, 3) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 29) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 16) (20, 5) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 5) (29, 21) (29, 8) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 15) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 27) (16, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (1, 6, 14, 17)
- (21, 24, 11, 14)
- (21, 24, 27, 7)
- (21, 29, 18, 10)
- (6, 14, 19, 3)
- (6, 14, 11, 24)
- (6, 26, 28, 1)
- (6, 26, 22, 9)
- (6, 23, 7, 27)
- (6, 23, 1, 28)
- (9, 12, 8, 29)
- (14, 19, 15, 29)
- (14, 19, 3, 0)
- (14, 19, 16, 2)
- (14, 11, 24, 27)
- (14, 17, 25, 29)
- (17, 25, 29, 18)
- (17, 2, 16, 27)
- (17, 2, 16, 19)
- (8, 13, 21, 24)
- (8, 13, 5, 22)
- (8, 13, 5, 10)
- (8, 13, 4, 27)
- (5, 13, 4, 27)
- (5, 22, 26, 28)
- (5, 22, 9, 12)
- (5, 22, 9, 8)
- (5, 10, 18, 29)
- (26, 28, 1, 6)
- (26, 22, 9, 12)
- (26, 22, 9, 8)
- (26, 22, 5, 13)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 6, (14, 17), 17>
- <21, 24, (11, 14), 14>
- <21, 24, (27, 7), 24>
- <21, 29, (18, 10), 29>
- <6, 14, (19, 3), 14>
- <6, 26, (28, 1), 26>
- <6, 26, (22, 9), 26>
- <6, 23, (7, 27), 23>
- <9, 12, (8, 29), 12>
- <14, 19, (15, 29), 19>
- <14, 11, (24, 27), 11>
- <14, 17, (25, 29), 17>
- <17, 25, (29, 18), 25>
- <17, 2, (16, 27), 2>
- <8, 13, (21, 24), 13>
- <8, 13, (5, 22), 13>
- <8, 13, (5, 10), 13>
- <8, 13, (4, 27), 13>
- <5, 13, (4, 27), 13>
- <26, 28, (1, 6), 28>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 18 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [18].
