<5, 14, 3, 2>
<5, 3, 4, 9>
<5, 3, 14, 1>
<9, 4, 3, 5>
<9, 4, 7, 1>
<9, 4, 3, 2>
<9, 8, 7, 1>
<9, 8, 11, 6>
<9, 11, 8, 7>
<4, 7, 1, 6>
<4, 7, 8, 5>
<7, 0, 12, 6>
<3, 14, 1, 7>
<3, 14, 2, 6>
<3, 2, 0, 12>
<11, 6, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 14, 1>
<2, 6, 12, 0>
<6, 12, 0, 13>
<12, 0, 13, 10>
<10, 13, 1, 7>

- Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, 4, 7, 1, (9, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, 4, 3, 2, (9, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, 8, 7, 1, (9, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, 11, 8, 7, (9, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <4, 7, 1, 6, (4, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <7, 0, 12, 6, (7, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, 14, 1, 7, (3, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, 14, 2, 6, (3, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, 2, 0, 12, (3, 0)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <11, 6, 2, 3, (11, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 2, 14, 1, (0, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, 6, 12, 0, (2, 0)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 12, 0, 13, (6, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <12, 0, 13, 10, (12, 10)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <10, 13, 1, 7, (10, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <10, 13, 6, 2, (10, 6)>

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles found: [19]
