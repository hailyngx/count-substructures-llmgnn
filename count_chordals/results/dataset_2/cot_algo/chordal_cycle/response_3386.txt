Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 23) (1, 27) (21, 13) (21, 27) (21, 11) (4, 28) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 8) (2, 22) (2, 16) (29, 28) (8, 7) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 12) (8, 22) (23, 1) (23, 8) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 12) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 24) (20, 10) (26, 1) (26, 27) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 25) (6, 22) (6, 12) (28, 4) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 19) (18, 7) (18, 13) (22, 2) (22, 8) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 3) (3, 22) (17, 12) (17, 27) (9, 25) (9, 15) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 15) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 14) (24, 8) (24, 20) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 16) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 25) (15, 5) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 13) (27, 1) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 17) (10, 20) (10, 6) (10, 5) (16, 2) (16, 19) (14, 13) (14, 19) (5, 15) (5, 10) (11, 21) (11, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 26, 27, 1)
- Cycle 2: (21, 11, 4, 21)
- Cycle 3: (7, 20, 24, 8, 7)
- Cycle 4: (2, 22, 3, 22, 2)
- Cycle 5: (28, 4, 15, 25, 6, 28)
- Cycle 6: (7, 18, 13, 12, 17, 27, 26, 1, 23, 8, 24, 20, 7)
- Cycle 7: (8, 22, 3, 22, 0, 12, 13, 14, 19, 16, 2, 22, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 3 has a chord: (20, 10)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (4, 28)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (8, 22)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Thus, the final count is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1, 26, 27, 1> (Chord: (1, 26))
2. <21, 11, 4, 21> (Chord: (21, 11))
3. <7, 18, 13, 12, 17, 27, 26, 1, 23, 8, 24, 20, 7> (Chord: (8, 22))
