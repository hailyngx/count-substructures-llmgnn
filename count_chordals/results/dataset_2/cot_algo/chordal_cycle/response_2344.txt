Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (9, 28), 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <21, (18, 15), 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <27, (1, 9), 28>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, (24, 25), 23>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (20, 2), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <26, (28, 17), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <15, (18, 8), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <19, (16, 13), 10>


Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [8].
