- <5, 13, 15, 18> has chord (15, 18)
- <5, 13, 1, 0> has chord (1, 0)
- <5, 13, 18, 15> has chord (18, 15)
- <5, 19, 17, 3> has chord (17, 3)
- <5, 19, 2, 4> has chord (2, 4)
- <10, 15, 13, 18> has chord (13, 18)
- <9, 12, 0, 17> has chord (0, 17)
- <9, 12, 4, 10> has chord (4, 10)
- <14, 13, 1, 6> has chord (1, 6)
- <14, 13, 15, 18> has chord (15, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]

Unique Chordal 4-cycles:
<5, 13, 1, 6>, <5, 13, 15, 18>, <5, 13, 1, 0>, <5, 13, 18, 15>, <5, 19, 17, 3>, <5, 19, 2, 4>, <10, 15, 13, 18>, <9, 12, 0, 17>, <9, 12, 4, 10>, <14, 13, 1, 6>
