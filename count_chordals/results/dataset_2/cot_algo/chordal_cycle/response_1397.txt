Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (4, 6) (4, 16) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 16) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (13, 11) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 19) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 15) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 1 - 3 - 14 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 1 - 12 - 7 - 6 - 4 - 16 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 3: 8 - 9 - 17 - 15 - 19 - 10 - 12 - 7 - 6 - 4 - 16 - 18 - 2 - 8
- Cycle 4: 11 - 5 - 0 - 16 - 4 - 6 - 7 - 12 - 1 - 3 - 14 - 11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: This cycle has no chord.
- Cycle 2: <2, 18>
- Cycle 3: This cycle has no chord.
- Cycle 4: <0, 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 1, 3, 14, 5>
- <11, 5, 0, 16, 4, 6, 7, 12, 1, 3, 14, 11>
