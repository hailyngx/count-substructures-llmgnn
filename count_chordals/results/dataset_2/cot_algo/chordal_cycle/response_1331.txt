Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 27) (17, 27) (17, 26) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 20) (21, 5) (21, 15) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 25) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 16) (23, 9) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 28) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 20) (18, 0) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 15) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 6) (15, 21) (15, 12) (15, 20) (20, 21) (20, 18) (20, 12) (20, 15) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 13) (28, 2) (28, 11) (28, 25) (3, 21) (3, 26) (9, 23) (9, 12) (22, 10) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 19) (16, 23) (16, 29) (5, 21) (5, 26) (5, 24) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 3) (26, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 13) (29, 16) (29, 24) (19, 11) (19, 0) (6, 14) (6, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 22) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 13) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 24) (25, 8) (25, 28) (24, 5) (24, 29) (24, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 7-21-15-12-7
- Cycle 2: 8-23-16-29-24-13-2-18-4-6-14-27-13-1-11-28-2-10-8
- Cycle 3: 21-15-12-20-21
- Cycle 4: 18-2-13-1-7-21-20-18
- Cycle 5: 23-8-10-2-28-25-23
- Cycle 6: 26-17-27-13-24-29-16-23-26
- Cycle 7: 0-8-10-22-0
- Cycle 8: 5-21-7-1-13-24-5
- Cycle 9: 3-21-7-12-9-23-16-29-24-13-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle (1 chord) = <7, 21, 15, 12>
Chordal 4-cycle (1 chord) = <8, 23, 16, 29>
Chordal 4-cycle (1 chord) = <21, 15, 12, 20>
Chordal 4-cycle (1 chord) = <18, 2, 13, 1>
Chordal 4-cycle (1 chord) = <23, 8, 10, 2>
Chordal 4-cycle (1 chord) = <26, 17, 27, 13>
Chordal 4-cycle (1 chord) = <0, 8, 10, 22>
Chordal 4-cycle (1 chord) = <5, 21, 7, 1>
Chordal 4-cycle (1 chord) = <3, 21, 7, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
