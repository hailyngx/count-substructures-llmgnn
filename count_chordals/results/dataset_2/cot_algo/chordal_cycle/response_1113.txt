Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 7 - 10 - 13 - 6
- Cycle 2: 7 - 10 - 13 - 3
- Cycle 3: 12 - 7 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 4: 12 - 7 - 14 - 3
- Cycle 5: 1 - 12 - 7 - 10
- Cycle 6: 1 - 12 - 7 - 14
- Cycle 7: 6 - 14 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 8: 6 - 14 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 9: 14 - 6 - 7 - 12
- Cycle 10: 14 - 6 - 13 - 10
- Cycle 11: 13 - 10 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 12: 13 - 10 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 13: 0 - 13 - 10 - 7
- Cycle 14: 0 - 13 - 14 - 6

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <7, (10, 13), 6>
- <7, (10, 13), 3>
- <12, (7, 6), 1>
- <12, (7, 14), 3>
- <1, (12, 7), 10>
- <1, (12, 7), 14>
- <6, (14, 7), 5>
- <6, (14, 3), 2>
- <14, (6, 7), 12>
- <14, (6, 13), 10>
- <13, (10, 9), 1>
- <13, (10, 7), 6>
- <0, (13, 10), 7>
- <0, (13, 14), 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have [14].
