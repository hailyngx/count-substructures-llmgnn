Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are various cycles in the graph, and we will list only those of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 7-4-9-3-7 (length 4)
- Cycle 2: 7-4-8-9-7 (length 4)
- Cycle 3: 0-1-7-4-0 (length 4)
- Cycle 4: 0-1-7-9-0 (length 4)
- Cycle 5: 0-1-2-3-0 (length 4)
- Cycle 6: 0-8-9-4-0 (length 4)
- Cycle 7: 0-8-3-9-0 (length 4)
- Cycle 8: 0-8-4-7-0 (length 4)
- Cycle 9: 0-8-6-5-0 (length 4)
- Cycle 10: 5-6-8-9-5 (length 4)
- Cycle 11: 5-6-0-1-5 (length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

After checking each cycle, we find that only Cycle 3: (0, 1, 7, 4, 0) has exactly one chord, which is edge (1, 4) connecting non-adjacent nodes 1 and 4.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, 1, 7, 4> with chord (1, 4)
