Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2:
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3:
- Count of chordless cycles found: [0]
