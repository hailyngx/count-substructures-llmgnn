Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 3) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
    - There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph. 

Step 2:
    - Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, we cannot find any chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3:
    - The number of chordless cycles found is 0, so the final count of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
