Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 17) (4, 9) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 16) (14, 13) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 18) (15, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 18) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 3) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 17) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 17) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 12) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 3) (16, 14) (16, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1: <0, 10, 12, 6>
2. Cycle 2: <0, 14, 4, 9>
3. Cycle 3: <0, 10, 8, 3>
4. Cycle 4: <0, 2, 6, 11>
5. Cycle 5: <0, 13, 1, 19>
6. Cycle 6: <0, 13, 3, 8>
7. Cycle 7: <0, 14, 16, 10>
8. Cycle 8: <1, 13, 3, 18>
9. Cycle 9: <1, 18, 3, 8>
10. Cycle 10: <1, 19, 2, 6>
11. Cycle 11: <2, 0, 14, 4>
12. Cycle 12: <2, 0, 10, 8>
13. Cycle 13: <2, 3, 8, 10>
14. Cycle 14: <2, 6, 11, 5>
15. Cycle 15: <3, 8, 10, 0>
16. Cycle 16: <3, 13, 0, 14>
17. Cycle 17: <3, 18, 1, 13>
18. Cycle 18: <4, 9, 17, 12>
19. Cycle 19: <4, 14, 16, 10>
20. Cycle 20: <5, 6, 2, 0>
21. Cycle 21: <5, 12, 6, 11>
22. Cycle 22: <6, 2, 0, 14>
23. Cycle 23: <6, 5, 11, 18>
24. Cycle 24: <8, 10, 0, 14>
25. Cycle 25: <8, 3, 2, 6>
26. Cycle 26: <9, 17, 19, 1>
27. Cycle 27: <10, 12, 17, 9>
28. Cycle 28: <11, 5, 6, 15>
29. Cycle 29: <13, 0, 2, 6>
30. Cycle 30: <13, 1, 19, 17>
31. Cycle 31: <14, 0, 2, 19>
32. Cycle 32: <14, 4, 9, 17>
33. Cycle 33: <15, 6, 12, 17>
34. Cycle 34: <16, 14, 4, 9>
35. Cycle 35: <18, 1, 13, 3>
36. Cycle 36: <18, 11, 5, 12>
37. Cycle 37: <19, 1, 13, 3>
38. Cycle 38: <19, 2, 3, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- There are no chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 38 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
