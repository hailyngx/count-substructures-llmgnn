Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 14) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

Cycles of length 4: 
- (5, 13, 1, 2, 5)
- (5, 8, 10, 13, 5)
- (5, 2, 1, 13, 5)
- (8, 10, 13, 11, 8)
- (8, 10, 13, 5, 8)
- (8, 10, 7, 11, 8)
- (8, 7, 11, 13, 8)
- (8, 7, 11, 2, 8)
- (7, 10, 13, 11, 7)
- (7, 10, 8, 5, 7)
- (7, 11, 13, 10, 7)
- (7, 11, 2, 8, 7)
- (1, 2, 11, 13, 1)
- (1, 13, 10, 7, 1)
- (2, 1, 13, 11, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
<5, (8, 10), 13>
<5, (13, 1), 2>
<7, (10, 13), 11>
<1, (2, 13), 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found. 

The number of chordal 4-cycles is [4].
