Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 1, 7, 12, 6, 14, 2, 0, 13)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 4, 7, 13)
        - Cycle 3: (9, 4, 7, 1, 0, 13, 2, 14, 6, 12, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 7, 12, 6, 14, 2, 0, 1)
        - Cycle 5: (7, 1, 4, 9, 3, 10, 11, 0)
        - Cycle 6: (1, 0, 11, 10, 9, 4, 7, 12)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 9, 4, 7, 1, 0, 11, 10)
        - Cycle 8: (6, 14, 2, 0, 1, 4, 7, 12)
        - Cycle 9: (10, 9, 4, 7, 1, 0, 11)
        - Cycle 10: (11, 0, 13, 2, 14, 6, 12)
        - Cycle 11: (8, 3, 9, 4, 1, 7, 12)
        - Cycle 12: (2, 14, 6, 12, 7, 4, 1)
        - Cycle 13: (13, 0, 1, 4, 9, 10)
        - Cycle 14: (12, 5, 11, 10, 9, 3)
        - Cycle 15: (0, 1, 4, 7, 12, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
        - Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (4, 7), 13>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        The total number of chordless cycles found is [15].
