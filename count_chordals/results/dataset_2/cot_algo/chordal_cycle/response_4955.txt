Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 1) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (6, 4, 2, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 2, 13, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 2, 7, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 2, 0, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 2, 9, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 1, 11, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 1, 10, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 8, 11, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 8, 10, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 4, 3, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 4, 14, 6)
- Cycle 12: (6, 2, 7, 5, 6)
- Cycle 13: (6, 2, 0, 5, 6)
- Cycle 14: (6, 2, 13, 12, 6)
- Cycle 15: (6, 2, 13, 14, 6)
- Cycle 16: (6, 2, 9, 11, 6)
- Cycle 17: (6, 2, 9, 10, 6)
- Cycle 18: (6, 1, 10, 8, 6)
- Cycle 19: (6, 8, 11, 1, 6)
- Cycle 20: (6, 4, 3, 7, 6)
- Cycle 21: (6, 4, 14, 13, 6)
- Cycle 22: (6, 2, 7, 3, 6)
- Cycle 23: (6, 2, 0, 2, 6)
- Cycle 24: (6, 1, 11, 9, 6)
- Cycle 25: (6, 8, 10, 1, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <6, (2, 6), 4, 6>
- <6, (2, 6), 13, 6>
- <6, (2, 6), 7, 6>
- <6, (2, 6), 0, 6>
- <6, (2, 6), 9, 6>
- <6, (1, 6), 11, 6>
- <6, (1, 6), 10, 6>
- <6, (8, 6), 11, 6>
- <6, (8, 6), 10, 6>
- <6, (4, 6), 3, 6>
- <6, (4, 6), 14, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [11]
