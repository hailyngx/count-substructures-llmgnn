Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 6) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 9) (8, 19) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 12) (19, 6) (19, 15) (19, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 7) (16, 12) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 18) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (1, 7, 16, 10, 0, 2, 14, 11)
- Cycle 2: (3, 6, 5, 15, 9, 4, 11, 14)
- Cycle 3: (6, 5, 15, 19, 8, 7, 1, 13)
- Cycle 4: (6, 7, 1, 0, 2, 14, 18, 6)
- Cycle 5: (3, 12, 16, 7, 5, 6, 3)
- Cycle 6: (1, 0, 10, 11, 14, 18, 6, 1)
- Cycle 7: (4, 13, 1, 0, 2, 14, 11, 4)
- Cycle 8: (9, 15, 5, 6, 3, 17, 12, 9)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: <2, 14>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: <15, 9>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: <13, 1>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: <18, 6>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: <6, 12>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: <10, 11>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: <0, 14>
- Cycle 8 has one chord: <3, 17>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have a total of [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (2, 14), 11)>
<3, (15, 9), 4)>
<6, (18, 6), 1)>
<7, (13, 1), 16)>
<16, (10, 11), 0)>
<4, (0, 14), 13)>
<9, (3, 17), 12)>
<12, (6, 12), 17)>
