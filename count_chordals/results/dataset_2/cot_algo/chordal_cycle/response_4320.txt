Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 14) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-9-5-3-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-8-9-1
- Cycle 3: 0-7-5-6-0
- Cycle 4: 0-7-13-9-1-0
- Cycle 5: 0-7-13-3-12-0
- Cycle 6: 0-7-5-6-10-2-8-0
- Cycle 7: 0-7-13-9-8-2-10-6-0
- Cycle 8: 0-14-6-10-2-12-14
- Cycle 9: 0-14-12-8-9-13-0

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has the chord (9, 3)
- Cycle 2 has the chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 3 has the chord (7, 5)
- Cycle 4 has the chord (13, 7)
- Cycle 5 has the chord (13, 3)
- Cycle 6 has the chord (6, 10)
- Cycle 7 has the chord (8, 9)
- Cycle 8 has the chord (6, 10)
- Cycle 9 has the chord (8, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (9, 3), 5, 3>
- <1, (4, 8), 9, 1>
- <0, (7, 5), 6, 0>
- <0, (13, 7), 9, 1, 0>
- <0, (13, 3), 12, 0>
- <0, 8, 9, (2, 10), 6, 0>
- <0, (9, 8), 1, 7, 13, 0>
- <8, 9, 13, 7, 5, (6, 10), 2, 8>
- <0, 6, 10, (2, 12), 14, 0>
