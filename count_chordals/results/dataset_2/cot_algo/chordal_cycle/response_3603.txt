        - Cycle 1: (11, 16, 3, 26, 11)
        - Cycle 2: (11, 25, 29, 8, 4, 23, 22, 9, 13, 24, 2, 11)
        - Cycle 3: (16, 3, 26, 27, 29, 25, 11, 16)
        - Cycle 4: (16, 3, 26, 12, 20, 28, 3, 16)
        - Cycle 5: (2, 24, 13, 9, 22, 23, 4, 8, 29, 25, 11, 2)
        - Cycle 6: (3, 16, 18, 6, 21, 14, 8, 29, 25, 11, 3)
        - Cycle 7: (8, 29, 25, 11, 2, 17, 9, 13, 24, 2, 8)
        - Cycle 8: (13, 24, 2, 17, 7, 5, 15, 12, 22, 9, 13)
        - Cycle 9: (22, 23, 4, 0, 15, 12, 20, 28, 19, 1, 22)
        - Cycle 10: (23, 22, 9, 17, 7, 5, 15, 0, 23)
        - Cycle 11: (4, 8, 14, 21, 6, 5, 15, 12, 20, 28, 3, 4)
        - Cycle 12: (15, 0, 4, 23, 22, 12, 26, 27, 29, 25, 15)
        - Cycle 13: (20, 12, 15, 5, 7, 17, 2, 24, 13, 9, 20)
        - Cycle 14: (0, 23, 4, 8, 29, 27, 26, 3, 28, 20, 0)
        - Cycle 15: (14, 8, 29, 27, 26, 6, 18, 16, 11, 25, 14)
        - Cycle 16: (5, 15, 0, 4, 23, 22, 9, 17, 2, 24, 5)
        - Cycle 17: (6, 5, 7, 17, 2, 24, 13, 9, 22, 12, 6)
        - Cycle 18: (9, 13, 24, 2, 17, 7, 6, 18, 16, 3, 9)
        - Cycle 19: (21, 14, 8, 4, 23, 22, 12, 20, 28, 19, 21)
        - Cycle 20: (7, 17, 2, 24, 13, 9, 22, 23, 4, 0, 7)
        - Cycle 21: (10, 15, 0, 4, 23, 22, 9, 13, 24, 2, 10)
        - Cycle 22: (28, 3, 26, 27, 29, 25, 11, 2, 24, 13, 28)
        - Cycle 23: (18, 6, 21, 14, 8, 29, 27, 26, 16, 3, 18)
        - Cycle 24: (1, 19, 28, 20, 12, 15, 0, 4, 23, 22, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 24), 13>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (17, 9), 13>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (16, 26), 11>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (0, 15), 23>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (7, 17), 15>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (21, 14), 18>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <8, (29, 25), 11>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <9, (17, 7), 22>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <10, (15, 5), 0>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <12, (20, 28), 15>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <13, (9, 22), 24>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <14, (8, 29), 15>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <16, (18, 6), 26>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 14: <19, (1, 28), 20>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 15: <21, (6, 7), 14>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 16: <23, (4, 8), 22>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 17: <24, (2, 13), 17>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 18: <26, (16, 3), 27>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        There are 18 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [18].
