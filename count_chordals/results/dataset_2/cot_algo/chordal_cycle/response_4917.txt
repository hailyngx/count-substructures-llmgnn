Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 17) (7, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 2) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 18) (1, 2) (1, 17) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 1) (17, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 19) (10, 2) (10, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 15) (19, 11) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 19) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 3) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 14) (13, 16) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle: 4 - 5 - 6 - 2 - 4
2. Cycle: 4 - 17 - 1 - 2 - 4
3. Cycle: 4 - 17 - 12 - 14 - 5 - 4
4. Cycle: 4 - 17 - 1 - 2 - 6 - 5 - 14 - 12 - 17
5. Cycle: 4 - 17 - 1 - 2 - 6 - 11 - 0 - 3 - 13 - 16 - 18 - 12 - 14 - 5 - 4
6. Cycle: 4 - 17 - 1 - 2 - 9 - 10 - 2 - 6 - 5 - 14 - 12 - 18 - 16 - 19 - 15 - 14 - 5 - 4
7. Cycle: 4 - 17 - 1 - 2 - 9 - 3 - 0 - 11 - 6 - 5 - 14 - 12 - 18 - 16 - 19 - 15 - 14 - 12 - 17

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <4, 5, 6, 2, (2, 6)>
2. <4, 17, 1, 2, (1, 17)>
3. <4, 17, 12, 14, (12, 14)>
4. <4, 17, 1, 2, 6, 5, 14, 12, 17, (2, 6)>
5. <4, 17, 1, 2, 6, 11, 0, 3, 13, 16, 18, 12, 14, 5, (5, 14)>
6. <4, 17, 1, 2, 9, 10, 2, 6, 5, 14, 12, 18, 16, 19, 15, (15, 19)>
7. <4, 17, 1, 2, 9, 3, 0, 11, 6, 5, 14, 12, 18, 16, 19, 15, 14, 12, (12, 14)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the number of chordless cycles is [7].
