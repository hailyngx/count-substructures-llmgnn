Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 3) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 1, 0, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 9, 13, 6, 1, 0, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 3, 0, 1, 6, 2, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 11, 3, 0, 1, 6, 13, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 7, 14, 0, 1, 6, 2, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (5, 4, 8, 14, 0, 1, 6, 13, 9, 5)

Step 2:
        - Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
            <5, 9, 2, 1, 0, 5> has a chord (1, 2)
            <5, 9, 13, 6, 1, 0, 5> has a chord (1, 6)
            <5, 3, 0, 1, 6, 2, 9, 5> has a chord (1, 9)
            <5, 11, 3, 0, 1, 6, 13, 9, 5> has a chord (1, 9)
            <5, 7, 14, 0, 1, 6, 2, 9, 5> has a chord (1, 9)
            <5, 4, 8, 14, 0, 1, 6, 13, 9, 5> has a chord (1, 9)

Step 3:
        - Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
