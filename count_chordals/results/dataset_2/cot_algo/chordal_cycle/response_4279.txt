Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 1, 2, 4) with edges (4, 7), (7, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (2, 1), (1, 7), (7, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 14, 11, 2, 4) with edges (4, 14), (14, 11), (11, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (2, 11), (11, 14), (14, 4)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 1, 2, 5) with edges (5, 7), (7, 1), (1, 2), (2, 5), (5, 2), (2, 1), (1, 7), (7, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 8, 3, 5) with edges (5, 6), (6, 8), (8, 3), (3, 5), (5, 3), (3, 8), (8, 6), (6, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 7, 1, 2, 9) with edges (9, 7), (7, 1), (1, 2), (2, 9), (9, 2), (2, 1), (1, 7), (7, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 0, 13, 12, 9) with edges (9, 0), (0, 13), (13, 12), (12, 9), (9, 12), (12, 13), (13, 0), (0, 9)
- Cycle 7: (10, 3, 8, 6, 10) with edges (10, 3), (3, 8), (8, 6), (6, 10), (10, 6), (6, 8), (8, 3), (3, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 2 has chord (14, 4)
- Cycle 3 has chord (2, 5)
- Cycle 4 has chord (8, 5)
- Cycle 5 has chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 6 has chord (13, 9)
- Cycle 7 has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 1 chordless cycle, which is cycle 7.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <<9, 0, 13, 12, 9>>
