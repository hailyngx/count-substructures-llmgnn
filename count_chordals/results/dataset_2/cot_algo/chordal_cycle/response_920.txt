Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 0) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 11) (26, 4) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 29) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (6, 1) (6, 12) (21, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (15, 16) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 20) (19, 11) (19, 5) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 18) (27, 13) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 8) (16, 15) (16, 29) (16, 8) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 29) (17, 9) (0, 13) (0, 8) (28, 22) (28, 23) (18, 11) (18, 25) (18, 23) (23, 25) (23, 28) (23, 18) (8, 27) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 29) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 7) (14, 10) (22, 28) (22, 14) (4, 26) (4, 2) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 27) (9, 17) (9, 4) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 2) (29, 3) (29, 16) (29, 12) (29, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (24, 12) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <13, 26, 25, 27, 13>
- <13, 26, 4, 2, 12, 6, 1, 10, 5, 3, 11, 19, 5, 20, 13>
- <3, 11, 19, 5, 20, 13, 21, 13, 0, 8, 27, 25, 26, 4, 9, 3>
- <11, 26, 25, 18, 23, 28, 22, 14, 10, 1, 6, 12, 2, 4, 9, 17, 9, 27, 25, 18>
- <13, 21, 13, 0, 8, 27, 25, 26, 11>
- <5, 10, 14, 22, 28, 23, 18, 25, 27, 9, 4, 26, 13, 20, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <13, 26, 25, 27, 13> has chord (26, 27)
- <13, 26, 4, 2, 12, 6, 1, 10, 5, 3, 11, 19, 5, 20, 13> has chord (3, 13)
- <3, 11, 19, 5, 20, 13, 21, 13, 0, 8, 27, 25, 26, 4, 9, 3> has chord (3, 21)
- <11, 26, 25, 18, 23, 28, 22, 14, 10, 1, 6, 12, 2, 4, 9, 17, 9, 27, 25, 18> has chord (9, 18)
- <13, 21, 13, 0, 8, 27, 25, 26, 11> has chord (11, 21)
- <5, 10, 14, 22, 28, 23, 18, 25, 27, 9, 4, 26, 13, 20, 5> has chord (5, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <13, 26, 25, 27, 13> with chord (26, 27)
2. <13, 26, 4, 2, 12, 6, 1, 10, 5, 3, 11, 19, 5, 20, 13> with chord (3, 13)
3. <3, 11, 19, 5, 20, 13, 21, 13, 0, 8, 27, 25, 26, 4, 9, 3> with chord (3, 21)
4. <11, 26, 25, 18, 23, 28, 22, 14, 10, 1, 6, 12, 2, 4, 9, 17, 9, 27, 25, 18> with chord (9, 18)
5. <13, 21, 13, 0, 8, 27, 25, 26, 11> with chord (11, 21)
6. <5, 10, 14, 22, 28, 23, 18, 25, 27, 9, 4, 26, 13, 20, 5> with chord (5, 18)
