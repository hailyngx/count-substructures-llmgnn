Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 10) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (16, 12) (16, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 13) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 1) (19, 17) (19, 6) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (1, 12) (1, 18) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: {1, 12, 6, 19, 17} with edges (1, 12), (12, 6), (6, 19), (19, 17), (17, 8), (8, 4), (4, 10), (10, 5), (5, 11), (11, 12)
- Cycle 2: {1, 12, 6, 19, 17} with edges (1, 12), (12, 1), (1, 18), (18, 7), (7, 17), (17, 19), (19, 6), (6, 12)
(... and more cycles)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
- <1, 12, 6, 19, 17, (1, 18)>
- <12, 6, 19, 17, 1, (6, 19)>
- (... and more cycles)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [<1>]
