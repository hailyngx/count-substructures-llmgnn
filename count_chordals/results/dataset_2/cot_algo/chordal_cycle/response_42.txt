Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle: 2 - 3 - 4 - 6 - 2
2. Cycle: 2 - 3 - 9 - 4 - 2
3. Cycle: 4 - 6 - 9 - 5 - 4
4. Cycle: 0 - 2 - 3 - 0
5. Cycle: 0 - 2 - 7 - 8 - 0
6. Cycle: 0 - 2 - 7 - 8 - 5 - 0
7. Cycle: 0 - 3 - 2 - 7 - 0
8. Cycle: 0 - 3 - 4 - 9 - 0
9. Cycle: 0 - 3 - 9 - 5 - 0
10. Cycle: 0 - 5 - 9 - 4 - 0

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Cycle <2, 3, 4, 6>: (2, 4)
2. Cycle <2, 3, 9, 4>: (2, 9)
3. Cycle <4, 6, 9, 5>: (4, 5)
4. Cycle <0, 2, 3, 0>: No chord
5. Cycle <0, 2, 7, 8>: (0, 7)
6. Cycle <0, 2, 7, 8, 5>: (0, 7)
7. Cycle <0, 3, 2, 7>: (0, 7)
8. Cycle <0, 3, 4, 9>: (0, 4)
9. Cycle <0, 3, 9, 5>: (0, 9)
10. Cycle <0, 5, 9, 4>: (0, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are total [6] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:
- Chordal cycle <2, 3, 4, 6> with chord (2, 4)
- Chordal cycle <2, 3, 9, 4> with chord (2, 9)
- Chordal cycle <4, 6, 9, 5> with chord (4, 5)
- Chordal cycle <0, 2, 7, 8> with chord (0, 7)
- Chordal cycle <0, 2, 7, 8, 5> with chord (0, 7)
- Chordal cycle <0, 3, 9, 5> with chord (0, 9)
