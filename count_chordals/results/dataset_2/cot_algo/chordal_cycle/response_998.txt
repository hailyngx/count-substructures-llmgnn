Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 14) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph. 

For example, one cycle is <1, 7, 2, 12, 1> with edges (1, 7), (7, 2), (2, 12), (12, 1).
Another cycle is <1, 7, 13, 11, 2, 8, 12, 1> with edges (1, 7), (7, 13), (13, 11), (11, 2), (2, 8), (8, 12), (12, 1).

Step 2: 
After checking each cycle, we find the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:

<1, 12, 2, 7, 1> with chord (12, 7)

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
