Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 11) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 3) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 14 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 7 - 6 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 7 - 11 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 6 - 1 - 10 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 14 - 0 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 7: 9 - 14 - 4 - 11 - 9
- Cycle 8: 6 - 7 - 11 - 4 - 6
- Cycle 9: 0 - 14 - 4 - 13 - 0
- Cycle 10: 1 - 6 - 13 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 11: 1 - 10 - 3 - 12 - 1
- Cycle 12: 10 - 2 - 7 - 11 - 10
- Cycle 13: 3 - 10 - 2 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 14: 3 - 12 - 0 - 1 - 3
- Cycle 15: 7 - 5 - 11 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 16: 7 - 6 - 13 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 17: 11 - 8 - 3 - 12 - 11
- Cycle 18: 2 - 7 - 6 - 13 - 2
- Cycle 19: 8 - 11 - 4 - 13 - 8
- Cycle 20: 4 - 13 - 6 - 1 - 4

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges):

<5, 9, 14, 0>, chord: (9, 14)
<5, 7, 6, 1>, chord: (7, 6)
<5, 7, 11, 8>, chord: (7, 11)
<9, 6, 1, 10>, chord: (6, 1)
<9, 14, 0, 1>, chord: (14, 0)
<9, 14, 4, 11>, chord: (14, 4)
<6, 7, 11, 4>, chord: (7, 11)
<0, 14, 4, 13>, chord: (14, 4)
<1, 6, 13, 4>, chord: (6, 13)
<1, 10, 3, 12>, chord: (10, 3)
<10, 2, 7, 11>, chord: (2, 7)
<3, 10, 2, 5>, chord: (10, 2)
<3, 12, 0, 1>, chord: (12, 0)
<7, 5, 11, 4>, chord: (5, 11)
<7, 6, 13, 4>, chord: (6, 13)
<11, 8, 3, 12>, chord: (8, 3)
<2, 7, 6, 13>, chord: (7, 6)
<8, 11, 4, 13>, chord: (11, 4)
<4, 13, 6, 1>, chord: (13, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [18]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is 18.
