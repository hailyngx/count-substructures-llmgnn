Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 19) (1, 9) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 14) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 18) (27, 19) (27, 23) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 18) (5, 23) (5, 10) (5, 16) (6, 20) (6, 0) (17, 24) (17, 2) (17, 26) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 14) (11, 28) (11, 4) (28, 11) (28, 25) (28, 23) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 3) (26, 0) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 25) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 24) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 19) (18, 27) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 3) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 28) (23, 9) (4, 11) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 16) (19, 1) (19, 27) (19, 9) (7, 14) (24, 17) (24, 10) (24, 25) (22, 21) (22, 16) (22, 12) (22, 3) (16, 5) (16, 29) (16, 2) (16, 22) (20, 6) (25, 28) (25, 0) (25, 24) (25, 14) (14, 21) (14, 29) (14, 7) (14, 25) (14, 12) (12, 15) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 22) (3, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 9, 19, 27, 23)
- Cycle 2: (1, 9, 19, 27, 18)
- Cycle 3: (1, 9, 23, 27, 18)
- Cycle 4: (21, 26, 17, 24, 10)
- Cycle 5: (21, 26, 3, 22, 12)
- Cycle 6: (21, 26, 0, 6, 20)
- Cycle 7: (21, 26, 17, 2, 16)
- Cycle 8: (21, 14, 29, 15, 12)
- Cycle 9: (21, 14, 29, 16, 22)
- Cycle 10: (21, 14, 7, 29, 15)
- Cycle 11: (21, 22, 3, 12, 15)
- Cycle 12: (21, 22, 16, 2, 17)
- Cycle 13: (15, 29, 16, 2, 17)
- Cycle 14: (15, 29, 14, 7, 21)
- Cycle 15: (27, 23, 5, 10, 24)
- Cycle 16: (27, 23, 28, 11, 4)
- Cycle 17: (27, 23, 9, 19, 1)
- Cycle 18: (27, 18, 8, 13, 18)
- Cycle 19: (27, 18, 13, 8, 18)
- Cycle 20: (27, 18, 3, 12, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (9, 27), 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <21, (26, 17), 24>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <21, (14, 29), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <21, (26, 3), 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <27, (23, 5), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <27, (18, 13), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <27, (23, 28), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <27, (18, 3), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 20 cycles in total, and 8 of them are chordal.
- So, the number of chordless cycles is 20 - 8 = [12].
