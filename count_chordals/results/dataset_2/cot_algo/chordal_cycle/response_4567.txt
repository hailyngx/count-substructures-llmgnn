Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5 -> 9 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5
- Cycle 2: 5 -> 9 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5
- Cycle 3: 5 -> 9 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5
- Cycle 4: 5 -> 9 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5
- Cycle 5: 5 -> 1 -> 4 -> 8 -> 5
- Cycle 6: 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5
- Cycle 7: 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5
- Cycle 8: 5 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5
- Cycle 9: 5 -> 2 -> 6 -> 0 -> 5
- Cycle 10: 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5
- Cycle 11: 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 8 <5, 1, (4, 8), 5> has a chord 4-8
- Cycle 11 <5, 2, (1, 3), 5> has a chord 1-3

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found. As there are 2 chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [2].
