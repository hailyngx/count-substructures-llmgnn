Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 14) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 4) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 10-0-6-8-11-10
- Cycle 2: 10-1-7-12-2-10
- Cycle 3: 10-1-7-9-4-13-11-10
- Cycle 4: 10-1-12-7-9-10

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: 10-0-6-8-11-10
    - Chord: (0, 11)
- Cycle 2: 10-1-7-12-2-10
    - Chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 3: 10-1-7-9-4-13-11-10
    - Chord: (7, 13)
- Cycle 4: 10-1-12-7-9-10
    - Chord: (1, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (0, 11), 10)>
- <2, (1, 2), 10)>
- <3, (7, 13), 10)>
- <4, (1, 9), 10)>
