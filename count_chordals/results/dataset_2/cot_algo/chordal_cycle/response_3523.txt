Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 17) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (15, 8) (10, 6) (10, 13) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 18) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 14) (12, 2) (12, 16) (14, 11) (14, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 0) (13, 4) (13, 10) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle of length 4: (1, 7, 4, 17, 1)
        - Cycle of length 4: (1, 11, 3, 0, 1)
        - Cycle of length 4: (2, 4, 7, 1, 2)
        - Cycle of length 4: (2, 8, 0, 3, 2)
        - Cycle of length 4: (4, 7, 2, 8, 4)
        - Cycle of length 4: (6, 9, 1, 7, 6)
        - Cycle of length 4: (6, 10, 13, 4, 6)
        - Cycle of length 4: (9, 16, 14, 11, 9)
        - Cycle of length 4: (9, 17, 7, 4, 9)
        - Cycle of length 4: (9, 18, 0, 6, 9)
        - Cycle of length 4: (16, 12, 2, 4, 16)
        - Cycle of length 4: (16, 14, 11, 1, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Cycle (1, 7, 4, 17, 1) has 2 chords: (4, 17)
        - Cycle (2, 4, 7, 1, 2) has 2 chords: (4, 7)
        - Cycle (9, 17, 7, 4, 9) has 2 chords: (7, 9)
        - Cycle (16, 12, 2, 4, 16) has 2 chords: (2, 16)
        - Cycle (16, 14, 11, 1, 16) has 2 chords: (11, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the provided graph is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        <1, (4, 17), 7)>
        <2, (4, 7), 1>
        <9, (7, 9), 17>
        <16, (2, 16), 4>
        <16, (11, 16), 1>
