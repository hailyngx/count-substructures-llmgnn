Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle <5, 9, 7, 2>
- Cycle <5, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle <5, 1, 6, 8>
- Cycle <5, 1, 4, 0>
- Cycle <5, 0, 3, 1>
- Cycle <5, 0, 3, 6>
- Cycle <5, 0, 3, 4>
- Cycle <9, 7, 2, 8>
- Cycle <9, 0, 4, 1>
- Cycle <9, 6, 1, 3>
- Cycle <4, 7, 2, 8>
- Cycle <4, 0, 7, 2>
- Cycle <6, 1, 4, 7>
- Cycle <1, 3, 6, 8>
- Cycle <3, 0, 4, 7>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, we need to check for cycles with exactly one chord. 
- The cycle <5, 9, 7, 2> has one chord (5, 7).
- The cycle <5, 9, 6, 1> has one chord (5, 6).
- The cycle <5, 1, 6, 8> has one chord (1, 6).
- The cycle <9, 0, 4, 1> has one chord (0, 4).
- The cycle <6, 1, 4, 7> has one chord (1, 4).
- The cycle <1, 3, 6, 8> has one chord (3, 6).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found. 
Therefore, the final count is [6].
