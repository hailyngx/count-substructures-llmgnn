Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (15, 16) (15, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 13) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 5) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 18) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (11, 12) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 0) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 19) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 13) (1, 8) (1, 16) (6, 17) (6, 12) (18, 10) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 16) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 13) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 15, 16, 1, 8, 14, 13, 7, 4, 2, 14, 10, 5, 9, 7, 19) 
- Cycle 2: (2, 4, 7, 13, 14, 8, 0, 13)
- Cycle 3: (2, 4, 9, 5, 13, 7, 19, 16, 1, 16)
- Cycle 4: (2, 14, 10, 17, 6, 12, 18, 10)
- Cycle 5: (3, 19, 16, 1, 8, 14, 13, 7)
- Cycle 6: (4, 9, 5, 13, 14, 10, 17, 2)
- Cycle 7: (4, 9, 7, 19, 16, 1, 8, 14)
- Cycle 8: (5, 10, 17, 14, 8, 0, 15, 16)
- Cycle 9: (6, 12, 18, 10, 17, 14, 8, 1)
- Cycle 10: (7, 19, 16, 1, 8, 14, 10, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for a chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (2, 14)
- Cycle 2 is chordal, with chord (2, 4)
- Cycle 3 has chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 4 is chordal, with chord (17, 6)
- Cycle 5 is chordal, with chord (19, 16)
- Cycle 6 has chord (7, 13)
- Cycle 7 has chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 8 has chord (15, 0)
- Cycle 9 is chordal, with chord (14, 10)
- Cycle 10 has chord (16, 1)


Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<2, (2, 4)>
<4, (17, 6)>
<5, (19, 16)>
<6, (7, 13)>
<7, (9, 5)>
<8, (15, 0)>
