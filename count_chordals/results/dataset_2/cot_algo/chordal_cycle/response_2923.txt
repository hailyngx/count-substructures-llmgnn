Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 0-3-1-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-4-2-0
- Cycle 3: 1-2-7-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-7-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-5-4-1
- Cycle 6: 1-7-8-1
- Cycle 7: 2-1-6-2
- Cycle 8: 3-0-6-3
- Cycle 9: 3-1-7-3
- Cycle 10: 3-4-0-3
- Cycle 11: 4-0-3-4
- Cycle 12: 4-2-1-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, 3, 7, (1, 8)> has exactly one chord 8.
- <1, 6, 5, (1, 4)> has exactly one chord 4.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is therefore [10].
