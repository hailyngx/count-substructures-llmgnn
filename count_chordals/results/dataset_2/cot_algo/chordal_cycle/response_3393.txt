Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 8) (5, 11) (5, 2) (6, 11) (6, 2) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 15) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 0) (12, 4) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 9) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 13) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 16) (14, 4) (14, 18) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 19) 

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is:

<1, (10, 16), 19>

Count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph: [1]
