Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-2-0-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-3-1-6
- Cycle 3: 6-9-7-0-6
- Cycle 4: 6-7-0-1-6
- Cycle 5: 6-7-2-9-6
- Cycle 6: 6-7-5-4-6
- Cycle 7: 6-5-7-0-6
- Cycle 8: 6-5-4-3-6
- Cycle 9: 6-3-1-0-6
- Cycle 10: 6-3-5-4-6
- Cycle 11: 6-8-1-0-6
- Cycle 12: 6-8-3-9-6
- Cycle 13: 6-8-0-1-6
- Cycle 14: 6-8-3-5-6
- Cycle 15: 6-8-0-7-6

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the cycles with a single chord are:
- <1, (3, 8), 0> (Cycle 11)

Step 3:
Since there is only one chordal cycle found in the graph, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
