Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5) 
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 2, 5) 
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 0, 5) 
- Cycle 4: (9, 6, 4, 9) 
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 7, 9) 
- Cycle 6: (9, 6, 1, 9) 
- Cycle 7: (4, 7, 3, 4) 
- Cycle 8: (7, 3, 1, 7) 
- Cycle 9: (7, 1, 5, 7) 
- Cycle 10: (7, 1, 6, 7) 
- Cycle 11: (7, 1, 3, 7) 
- Cycle 12: (6, 1, 5, 6) 
- Cycle 13: (1, 3, 4, 1) 
- Cycle 14: (1, 3, 7, 1) 
- Cycle 15: (0, 9, 5, 0) 
- Cycle 16: (2, 5, 1, 2) 
- Cycle 17: (2, 5, 7, 2) 
- Cycle 18: (2, 5, 0, 2) 
- Cycle 19: (2, 9, 6, 2) 
- Cycle 20: (2, 4, 7, 2) 
- Cycle 21: (2, 4, 3, 2) 
- Cycle 22: (2, 7, 3, 2) 

Step 2: 
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (5, 7), 6> 
- <3, (4, 7), 1> 
- <5, (9, 6), 0> 
- <6, (9, 7), 4> 
- <7, (9, 1), 6> 
- <9, (5, 2), 0> 

Step 3:
Final count: [6]
