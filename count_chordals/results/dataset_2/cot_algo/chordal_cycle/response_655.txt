Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (4, 7, 1, 6, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (7, 1, 8, 2, 7)
        - Cycle 3: (3, 14, 10, 6, 3)
        - Cycle 4: (10, 11, 0, 8, 10)
        - Cycle 5: (13, 5, 2, 8, 13)
        - Cycle 6: (6, 1, 8, 0, 6)
        - Cycle 7: (9, 6, 13, 12, 9)
        - Cycle 8: (2, 8, 0, 11, 2)
        - Cycle 9: (5, 13, 12, 2, 5)
        - Cycle 10: (14, 3, 12, 13, 14)
        - Cycle 11: (0, 2, 5, 12, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has chord (1, 6)
        - Cycle 2 has chord (1, 8)
        - Cycle 3 has chord (10, 6)
        - Cycle 4 has chord (11, 0)
        - Cycle 5 has chord (5, 8)
        - Cycle 6 has chord (1, 8)
        - Cycle 7 has chord (6, 12)
        - Cycle 8 has chord (2, 11)
        - Cycle 9 has chord (13, 2)
        - Cycle 10 has chord (3, 13)
        - Cycle 11 has chord (2, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = 0

Thus, in this graph, there are no chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [0].
