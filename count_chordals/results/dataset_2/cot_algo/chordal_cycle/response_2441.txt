Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (1, 5, 4, 9, 1)
- (1, 5, 4, 8, 6, 1)
- (1, 5, 9, 8, 6, 1)
- (4, 5, 9, 8, 6, 4)
- (3, 1, 5, 7, 3)
- (7, 5, 9, 8, 7)
- (7, 5, 4, 0, 7)
- (2, 3, 1, 6, 2)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- <1, 5, 4, 9, 1> has a chord: (5, 9)
- <1, 5, 4, 8, 6, 1> has a chord: (4, 8)
- <1, 5, 9, 8, 6, 1> has a chord: (9, 8)
- <4, 5, 9, 8, 6, 4> has a chord: (5, 8)
- <3, 1, 5, 7, 3> has no chords
- <7, 5, 9, 8, 7> has a chord: (5, 8)
- <7, 5, 4, 0, 7> has a chord: (4, 0)
- <2, 3, 1, 6, 2> has no chords

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
