Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 5) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-7-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-11-13-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-14-11-13-1-0
- Cycle 4: 0-3-5-14-0
- Cycle 5: 0-3-2-6-7-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (7, 5)
- Cycle 2 has two chords, not valid
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (11, 13)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (3, 14)
- Cycle 5 has two chords, not valid

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, 4, 7, 5, 0> with a chord (7, 5)
2. <0, 3, 14, 0, 4> with a chord (3, 14)
