Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (5, 7, 9, 6)
2. (5, 1, 6, 2)
3. (5, 1, 6, 3)
4. (5, 7, 4, 3)
5. (5, 3, 2, 6)
6. (5, 3, 6, 7)
7. (1, 2, 6, 8)
8. (1, 2, 6, 3)
9. (1, 6, 7, 4)
10. (1, 7, 4, 8)
11. (1, 7, 6, 9)
12. (9, 6, 7, 4)
13. (9, 6, 3, 2)
14. (9, 7, 4, 8)
15. (9, 7, 6, 1)
16. (6, 3, 4, 7)
17. (6, 3, 2, 8)
18. (6, 7, 4, 8)
19. (6, 7, 5, 1)
20. (6, 2, 3, 5)
21. (4, 7, 5, 1)
22. (4, 7, 6, 9)
23. (4, 3, 6, 1)
24. (7, 5, 1, 6)
25. (7, 5, 3, 9)
26. (7, 6, 1, 5)
27. (7, 6, 3, 4)
28. (7, 4, 3, 0)
29. (8, 6, 1, 5)
30. (8, 6, 2, 1)
31. (8, 6, 7, 1)
32. (8, 2, 1, 5)
33. (8, 2, 3, 6)
34. (8, 4, 7, 5)
35. (8, 4, 3, 6)
36. (2, 6, 1, 5)
37. (2, 6, 7, 4)
38. (2, 1, 5, 7)
39. (2, 1, 6, 9)
40. (1, 5, 3, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <1, (5, 7), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles found is [39].
