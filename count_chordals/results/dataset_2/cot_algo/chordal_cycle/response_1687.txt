Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 9) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 4, 1, 7, 0>
- <0, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9, 0>
- <0, 4, 3, 6, 8, 11, 7, 12, 0>
- <0, 4, 3, 14, 5, 0>
- <0, 5, 13, 12, 7, 0>
- <0, 5, 13, 12, 0>
- <0, 5, 10, 7, 1, 4, 0>
- <0, 5, 10, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0>
- <0, 5, 10, 7, 1, 2, 4, 0>
- <0, 5, 10, 14, 3, 4, 0>
- <0, 5, 10, 14, 6, 3, 4, 0>
- <0, 9, 1, 4, 3, 14, 5, 0>
- <0, 9, 1, 2, 3, 14, 5, 0>
- <0, 9, 11, 8, 6, 3, 14, 5, 0>
- <1, 4, 3, 2, 10, 14, 6, 8, 11, 7, 0, 5, 13, 12, 0, 9, 1>
- <2, 1, 4, 3, 14, 5, 0, 12, 7, 10, 5, 13, 12, 0, 9, 11, 8, 6, 3, 2>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 1, 7, 0> has one chord (4, 1) forming a chordal 4-cycle <1, (4, 1), 7>.
- <0, 4, 3, 6, 8, 11, 7, 12, 0> has one chord (8, 6) forming a chordal 4-cycle <2, (8, 6), 12>.
- <0, 5, 13, 12, 0> has one chord (13, 5) forming a chordal 4-cycle <3, (13, 5), 12>.
- <0, 9, 1, 4, 3, 14, 5, 0> has one chord (1, 4) forming a chordal 4-cycle <4, (1, 4), 5>.
- <1, 4, 3, 2, 10, 14, 6, 8, 11, 7, 0, 5, 13, 12, 0, 9, 1> has one chord (1, 9) forming a chordal 4-cycle <5, (1, 9), 4>.
- <2, 1, 4, 3, 14, 5, 0, 12, 7, 10, 5, 13, 12, 0, 9, 11, 8, 6, 3, 2> has one chord (2, 3) forming a chordal 4-cycle <6, (2, 3), 5>.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6].
