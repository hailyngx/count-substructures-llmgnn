Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycles:
   <1, 21, 29, (26, 13), 9>
   <15, 27, 20, (18, 10), 2, 9>
   <15, 17, 19, (1, 21), 4>
   <15, (27, 20), 18, 14, 0, 16>
   <15, 9, 3, (11, 6), 2, 10>
   <15, 4, 22, 12, (16, 0), 14>
   <27, 20, 18, 14, (0, 16), 5, 17, 15>
   <1, 4, 22, 12, (16, 0), 14>
   <9, 15, 27, (20, 18), 14, 0, 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
   There are [21] chordless cycles.
