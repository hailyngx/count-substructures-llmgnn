Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (11, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 9) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <1, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 3, 6, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 7, 13, 4, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 5, 3, 6, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 13, 9, 14, 3, 6, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 12, 2, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 12, 0, 10, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 10, 0, 12, 2, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 10, 14, 3, 6, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 10, 14, 9, 13, 7, 1>
- Cycle 11: <6, 3, 14, 9, 4, 6>
- Cycle 12: <6, 8, 12, 2, 6>
- Cycle 13: <6, 8, 13, 7, 1, 6>
- Cycle 14: <6, 4, 13, 7, 5, 6>
- Cycle 15: <6, 4, 10, 1, 6>
- Cycle 16: <10, 0, 12, 5, 10>
- Cycle 17: <10, 0, 11, 9, 14, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Only Cycle 13: <6, 8, 13, 7, 1, 6> has exactly one chord 8-1.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
One chordal 4-cycle is found, so the final count is [1].
