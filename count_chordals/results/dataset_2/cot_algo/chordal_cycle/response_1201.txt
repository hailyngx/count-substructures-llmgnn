Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 11) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4 or more: 
<5, 3, 0, 11, 14>
<5, 3, 10, 9, 2>
<5, 7, 4, 9, 2>
<5, 7, 6, 8, 10>
<5, 10, 9, 2, 14>
<9, 4, 7, 6, 11>
<9, 7, 1, 13, 8>
<4, 7, 6, 8, 10>
<7, 5, 3, 10, 12>
<7, 9, 2, 13, 1>
<7, 9, 12, 3, 14>
<1, 7, 4, 14, 11>
<3, 5, 10, 8, 6>
<3, 10, 0, 11, 14>
<10, 5, 7, 1, 13>
<10, 9, 12, 6, 8>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
<5, 3, 10, 9, 2> (chord: (9, 2))
<5, 7, 4, 9, 2> (chord: (4, 9))
<5, 10, 9, 2, 14> (chord: (9, 2))
<9, 7, 1, 13, 8> (chord: (7, 1))

Step 3:
There are [4] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
