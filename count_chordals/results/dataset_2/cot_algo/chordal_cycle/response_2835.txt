Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 9) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 18) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 9) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 18) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 2) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 0) (15, 14) (15, 9) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 19) (9, 15) (4, 1) 

Response:
[2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<0, (16, 13), 14, 3)>
<7, (9, 19), 15, 14)>
