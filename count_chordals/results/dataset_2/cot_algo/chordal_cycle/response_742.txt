Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles with length 4 or more are:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 7 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 8 - 13 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 13 - 10 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 6 - 11 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 7 - 3 - 13 - 9
- Cycle 6: 4 - 7 - 3 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 7: 8 - 13 - 3 - 7 - 8
- Cycle 8: 13 - 10 - 0 - 2 - 13
- Cycle 9: 7 - 11 - 1 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 10: 1 - 6 - 3 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 11: 7 - 4 - 8 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 12: 14 - 12 - 8 - 13 - 14
- Cycle 13: 0 - 10 - 1 - 14 - 0
- Cycle 14: 13 - 8 - 5 - 6 - 13
- Cycle 15: 3 - 7 - 11 - 6 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (7, 13), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [14] chordless cycles found.
