Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 6) (14, 0) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 3) (13, 8) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 19) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 15) (12, 15) (12, 9) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 19) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (5, 3) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 7) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 1-3-8-16-2-4 (length 5)
        - Cycle 2: 1-6-16-8-3-13 (length 5)
        - Cycle 3: 1-6-16-4-15-12 (length 5)
        - Cycle 4: 1-10-0-14-19-18 (length 5)
        - Cycle 5: 1-10-7-17-18-19 (length 5)
        - Cycle 6: 3-5-9-12-15-4 (length 5)
        - Cycle 7: 3-7-17-11-18-19 (length 5)
        - Cycle 8: 3-8-16-6-1-10 (length 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Cycle 1 is chordal with chord (1, 4): <1, (1,4), 3, 8, 16, 2>
        - Cycle 2 is chordal with chord (1, 13): <1, (1,13), 6, 16, 8, 3>
        - Cycle 3 is chordal with chord (6, 15): <6, (6,15), 16, 4, 1>
        - Cycle 4 is chordal with chord (0, 14): <0, (0,14), 10, 19, 18>
        - Cycle 5 is chordal with chord (10, 17): <10, (10,17), 0, 1, 6>
        - Cycle 6 is chordal with chord (3, 12): <3, (3,12), 15, 4, 5>
        - Cycle 7 is chordal with chord (7, 18): <7, (7,18), 17, 11, 19>
        - Cycle 8 is chordal with chord (3, 6): <3, (3,6), 16, 8, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
