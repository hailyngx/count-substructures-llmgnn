Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle <1, 5, 4, 3> with edges (1, 5), (5, 4), (4, 3), (3, 1)
- Cycle <1, 6, 2, 5> with edges (1, 6), (6, 2), (2, 5), (5, 1)
- Cycle <0, 6, 2, 5> with edges (0, 6), (6, 2), (2, 5), (5, 0)

Step 2: 
Checking for chords in each cycle:
1. Cycle <1, 5, 4, 3> has a chord (4, 1): <1, (4, 1), 3>
2. Cycle <1, 6, 2, 5> has a chord (6, 5): <1, (6, 5), 2>
3. Cycle <0, 6, 2, 5> has a chord (2, 6): <0, (2, 6), 5>

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [0].
