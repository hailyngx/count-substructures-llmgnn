Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: <1, 6, 12, 9, 13>
        - Cycle 2: <1, 6, 12, 18, 19, 2, 15, 10, 29, 3>
        - Cycle 3: <1, 29, 16, 25, 17, 22>
        - Cycle 4: <1, 29, 16, 25, 27, 21, 20, 2, 15, 10>
        - Cycle 5: <1, 29, 3, 1>
        - Cycle 6: <6, 12, 18, 19, 2, 15, 10, 29, 3, 1>
        - Cycle 7: <6, 12, 18, 19, 2, 20, 4, 0, 1>
        - Cycle 8: <6, 12, 18, 26, 8, 29, 3, 1>
        - Cycle 9: <9, 12, 18, 19, 2, 15, 10, 29, 3>
        - Cycle 10: <9, 13, 5, 28, 24, 8, 29, 3>
        - Cycle 11: <9, 13, 17, 22, 21, 27, 25, 16>
        - Cycle 12: <9, 13, 17, 25, 27, 21, 20, 2, 19, 18>
        - Cycle 13: <9, 13, 17, 25, 16, 29, 3>
        - Cycle 14: <9, 12, 18, 19, 2, 20, 4, 0>
        - Cycle 15: <22, 21, 27, 25, 16, 29, 3>
        - Cycle 16: <22, 21, 20, 4, 0, 1, 6>
        - Cycle 17: <22, 17, 25, 16, 29, 3>
        - Cycle 18: <23, 22, 17, 25, 16>

Step 2: Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 2 has one chord: <1, (18, 19), 2, 15, 10, 29, 3>
        - Cycle 6 has one chord: <6, 12, (18, 19), 2, 15, 10, 29, 3, 1>
        - Cycle 7 has one chord: <6, (12, 18), 19, 2, 20, 4, 0, 1>
        - Cycle 10 has one chord: <9, 13, 5, 28, (24, 8), 29, 3>
        - Cycle 12 has one chord: <9, 13, 17, 22, 21, 27, 25, 16>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        - Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]
