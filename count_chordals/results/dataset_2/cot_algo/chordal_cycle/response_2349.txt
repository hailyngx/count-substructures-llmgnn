Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 6) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 2) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 in the graph that have all edges existing are:
- (4, 11, 10, 5, 4)
- (4, 11, 14, 1, 4)
- (4, 5, 10, 11, 4)
- (4, 5, 2, 13, 4)
- (11, 10, 12, 13, 11)
- (11, 10, 5, 7, 11)
- (11, 14, 1, 6, 11)
- (11, 14, 3, 6, 11)
- (0, 11, 10, 12, 0)
- (0, 11, 14, 1, 0)
- (14, 11, 10, 5, 14)
- (14, 11, 0, 9, 14)
- (2, 0, 11, 14, 2)
- (2, 0, 9, 1, 2)
- (2, 5, 10, 11, 2)
- (2, 5, 7, 14, 2)
- (1, 14, 7, 5, 1)
- (1, 14, 11, 0, 1)
- (6, 14, 7, 5, 6)
- (6, 14, 3, 12, 6)
- (6, 2, 5, 7, 6)
- (6, 2, 13, 12, 6)
- (5, 4, 11, 10, 5)
- (5, 4, 3, 14, 5)
- (3, 4, 11, 10, 3)
- (3, 4, 13, 12, 3)
- (8, 10, 11, 14, 8)
- (8, 10, 5, 2, 8)
- (9, 0, 11, 10, 9)
- (9, 0, 2, 5, 9)
- (12, 10, 11, 14, 12)
- (12, 10, 5, 4, 12)
- (13, 2, 0, 9, 13)
- (13, 2, 6, 1, 13)

Step 2:

The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
- <1, (6, 14), 11, 0>

Step 3:

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the answer is [1].
