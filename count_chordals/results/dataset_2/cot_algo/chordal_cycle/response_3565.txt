Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 23) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 23) (17, 7) (22, 14) (22, 23) (22, 16) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 3) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 27) (15, 19) (15, 4) (20, 4) (29, 12) (29, 11) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 12) (26, 6) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 18) (3, 23) (3, 11) (3, 28) (11, 29) (11, 3) (11, 25) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 1) (18, 8) (18, 26) (4, 15) (4, 20) (4, 27) (27, 13) (27, 4) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 25) (7, 5) (25, 11) (25, 7) (25, 24) (21, 6) (21, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 10) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 16) (10, 16) (10, 19) (19, 15) (19, 10) (1, 13) (1, 28) (1, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 21) (12, 14) (12, 29) (12, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <6, 9, 7, 5, 6>
- Cycle 2: <14, 17, 7, 5, 14>
- Cycle 3: <17, 24, 16, 0, 14, 17>
- Cycle 4: <22, 23, 14, 0, 16, 22>
- Cycle 5: <23, 3, 11, 25, 24, 23>
- Cycle 6: <26, 13, 1, 5, 7, 26>
- Cycle 7: <26, 18, 8, 13, 27, 4, 26>
- Cycle 8: <0, 12, 29, 11, 3, 23, 14, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <6, 9, 7, 5, 6> has a chord {7, 5}.
- <14, 17, 7, 5, 14> has a chord {7, 5}.
- <17, 24, 16, 0, 14, 17> has a chord {16, 14}.
- <22, 23, 14, 0, 16, 22> has a chord {14, 16}.
- <26, 13, 1, 5, 7, 26> has a chord {1, 7}.
- <26, 18, 8, 13, 27, 4, 26> has a chord {8, 4}.
- <0, 12, 29, 11, 3, 23, 14, 0> has a chord {29, 3}.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 1 chordless cycle.

Therefore, the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <17, 24, 16, 0>
