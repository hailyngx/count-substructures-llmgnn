Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (0, 5, 8, 1, 0)
- (0, 5, 8, 2, 6, 0)
- (0, 5, 4, 9, 0)
- (0, 5, 4, 3, 7, 0)
- (5, 4, 9, 8, 5)
- (5, 4, 9, 1, 0, 5)
- (5, 4, 6, 2, 5)
- (5, 6, 2, 8, 5)
- (4, 6, 2, 8, 4)
- (4, 6, 2, 5, 0, 9, 4)
  
Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle (0, 5, 8, 1, 0) has exactly one chord <1, 4>
- Cycle (0, 5, 4, 9, 0) has exactly one chord <4, 8>
- Cycle (0, 5, 4, 3, 7, 0) has exactly one chord <4, 3>
- Cycle (5, 4, 9, 1, 0, 5) has exactly one chord <9, 1>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 1, 8, 5, 0> with chord <1, 4>
- <0, 5, 4, 9, 0> with chord <4, 8>
- <0, 5, 4, 3, 7, 0> with chord <4, 3>
- <5, 4, 9, 1, 0, 5> with chord <9, 1>
