Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 9) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 8) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 0) (19, 14) (19, 18) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 10) (9, 7) (9, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (3, 16, 17, 14)
- Cycle 2: (3, 12, 4, 13)
- Cycle 3: (15, 11, 1, 6)
- Cycle 4: (15, 11, 0, 14)
- Cycle 5: (15, 11, 1, 7)
- Cycle 6: (15, 11, 0, 13)
- Cycle 7: (4, 13, 14, 19)
- Cycle 8: (4, 13, 0, 11)
- Cycle 9: (4, 13, 0, 12)
- Cycle 10: (4, 7, 1, 6)
- Cycle 11: (4, 7, 1, 11)
- Cycle 12: (4, 7, 13, 14)
- Cycle 13: (7, 1, 6, 18)
- Cycle 14: (7, 1, 11, 0)
- Cycle 15: (7, 13, 14, 0)
- Cycle 16: (14, 17, 9, 7)
- Cycle 17: (14, 17, 16, 3)
- Cycle 18: (14, 17, 9, 17)
- Cycle 19: (17, 16, 10, 11)
- Cycle 20: (17, 16, 3, 12)
- Cycle 21: (17, 9, 7, 1)
- Cycle 22: (17, 9, 7, 13)
- Cycle 23: (17, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 24: (10, 11, 15, 11)
- Cycle 25: (10, 11, 0, 14)
- Cycle 26: (11, 1, 6, 18)
- Cycle 27: (11, 1, 7, 4)
- Cycle 28: (11, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 29: (11, 0, 14, 19)
- Cycle 30: (11, 0, 13, 4)
- Cycle 31: (11, 0, 13, 14)
- Cycle 32: (2, 18, 6, 1)
- Cycle 33: (2, 18, 6, 5)
- Cycle 34: (2, 18, 5, 13)
- Cycle 35: (18, 6, 1, 11)
- Cycle 36: (18, 6, 1, 7)
- Cycle 37: (18, 6, 5, 4)
- Cycle 38: (18, 5, 13, 0)
- Cycle 39: (18, 5, 13, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The only cycle with exactly one chord is:
- Cycle <4, (7, 13), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles found is [38].
