Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (12, 8) (12, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 2 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 14 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 4 - 8 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 11 - 2 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 5: 3 - 1 - 7 - 11 - 3
- Cycle 6: 3 - 8 - 4 - 14 - 3
- Cycle 7: 8 - 5 - 11 - 7 - 8
- Cycle 8: 8 - 2 - 1 - 0 - 8
- Cycle 9: 8 - 6 - 14 - 13 - 8
- Cycle 10: 2 - 9 - 14 - 11 - 2
- Cycle 11: 1 - 0 - 7 - 11 - 1
- Cycle 12: 7 - 3 - 8 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 13: 11 - 7 - 0 - 1 - 11
- Cycle 14: 14 - 9 - 2 - 3 - 14
- Cycle 15: 14 - 4 - 8 - 6 - 14
- Cycle 16: 14 - 6 - 13 - 10 - 14

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <5, (9, 2), 1>
- Cycle 2: <5, (9, 14), 4>
- Cycle 3: <5, (4, 8), 3>
- Cycle 4: <5, (11, 2), 1>
- Cycle 6: <3, (8, 4), 14>
- Cycle 8: <8, (2, 1), 0>
- Cycle 9: <8, (6, 14), 13>
- Cycle 10: <2, (9, 14), 11>
- Cycle 11: <1, (0, 7), 11>
- Cycle 12: <7, (3, 8), 2>
- Cycle 13: <11, (7, 0), 1>
- Cycle 14: <14, (9, 2), 3>
- Cycle 15: <14, (4, 8), 6>
- Cycle 16: <14, (6, 13), 10>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 8 chordless cycles found, so the final answer is [8].
