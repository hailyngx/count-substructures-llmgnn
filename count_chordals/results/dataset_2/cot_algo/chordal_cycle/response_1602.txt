Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:  
- Cycle 1: 6-9-1-3-6
- Cycle 2: 6-5-10-3-6
- Cycle 3: 6-5-11-2-6
- Cycle 4: 6-14-9-3-6
- Cycle 5: 9-6-5-10-9
- Cycle 6: 9-14-13-3-9
- Cycle 7: 1-3-10-6-1
- Cycle 8: 3-6-14-9-3
- Cycle 9: 3-10-7-11-3
- Cycle 10: 3-1-9-14-3
- Cycle 11: 10-3-13-7-10
- Cycle 12: 10-7-2-11-10
- Cycle 13: 11-5-12-2-11
- Cycle 14: 5-6-14-13-5
- Cycle 15: 5-11-7-0-5
- Cycle 16: 5-12-2-6-5
- Cycle 17: 2-6-5-11-2
- Cycle 18: 2-7-13-14-2
- Cycle 19: 13-14-9-1-13

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, (3, 1), 9, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (6, 10), 3, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (11, 2), 6, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <14, (9, 3), 6, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <14, (13, 9), 3, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <10, (3, 7), 6, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <10, (11, 7), 3, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <11, (2, 5), 6, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <12, (5, 6), 2, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <13, (7, 3), 10, 13>

Step 3: There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
