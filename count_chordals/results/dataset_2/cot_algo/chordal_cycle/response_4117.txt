Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 27) (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 9) (22, 11) (22, 13) (22, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 16) (17, 15) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 10) (23, 20) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 25) (3, 20) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 27) (1, 6) (1, 5) (26, 11) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 29) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 20) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 15) (24, 26) (24, 19) (24, 10) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 15) (8, 6) (19, 14) (19, 24) (19, 8) (19, 9) (27, 16) (27, 25) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 29) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 2) (0, 2) (10, 21) (10, 24) (28, 8) (28, 9) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 28) (9, 2) (20, 23) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 12) (12, 20) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 8) (29, 26) (29, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more along with their edges:

1. Cycle: (11, 16, 2, 5, 1, 6, 14, 19, 24, 26, 11)
2. Cycle: (13, 22, 7, 21, 10, 24, 19, 14, 3, 4, 11, 16, 2, 5, 26, 29, 6, 1)
3. Cycle: (3, 13, 22, 7, 18, 4, 11, 16, 17, 15, 8, 19, 24, 10, 21, 7)
4. Cycle: (9, 13, 22, 11, 16, 17, 15, 8, 14, 6, 1, 5, 26, 24, 19)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

1. Cycle <1, (11, 16, 2, 5), 1>
2. Cycle <2, (13, 22, 7, 21, 10, 24, 19, 14), 3>
3. Cycle <3, (3, 13, 22, 7), 4>
4. Cycle <4, (9, 13, 22, 11), 2>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are [4] chordal 4-cycles found.
