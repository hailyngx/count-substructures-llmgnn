Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (18, 3), 7, (10, 17), 1>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <7, (12, 0), 14, (18, 13), 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <7, (12, 0), 14, (18, 3), 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, (12, 0), 19, (16, 1), 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <10, (12, 0), 14, (18, 7), 10>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <10, (12, 0), 19, (16, 7), 10>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <13, (14, 18), 5, (7, 3), 13>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <14, (18, 13), 4, (1, 6), 14>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <16, (18, 14), 19, (0, 9), 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There are 99 cycles listed above, and 9 of them are chordal 4-cycles.
        - Thus, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [90].
