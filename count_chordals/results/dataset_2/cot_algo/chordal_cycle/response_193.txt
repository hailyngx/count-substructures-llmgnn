Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: 0-1-3-9-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-3-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-6-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-6-2-7-0
- Cycle 5: 0-7-5-8-0
- Cycle 6: 0-1-3-4-0

Step 2:
Only Cycle 3: 0-4-6-2-0 has exactly one chord, which is (4, 2).

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is therefore [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <0, (4, 2), 6>
