Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 8) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (6, 7) (6, 13) (15, 9) (19, 4) (19, 9) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 13) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 17) (16, 9) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: (1, 7, 4, 19, 9, 10, 1)  
- Cycle 2: (2, 7, 4, 19, 9, 12, 2)  
- Cycle 3: (3, 1, 7, 4, 13, 6, 3)  
- Cycle 4: (8, 11, 3, 1, 10, 9, 8)  
- Cycle 5: (0, 12, 9, 19, 4, 13, 0)  
- Cycle 6: (14, 8, 11, 18, 17, 0, 14)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord 
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 1)  
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (9, 2)  
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (7, 3)  
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (10, 8)  
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (12, 4)  
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (11, 0)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found  
There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.  

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
