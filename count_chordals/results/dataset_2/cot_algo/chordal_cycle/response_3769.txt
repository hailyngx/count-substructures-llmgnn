Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 10) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 7) (1, 19) (17, 0) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (0, 17) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 19) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 15) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 13) (7, 18) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (3, 14) (3, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 16) (5, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (6, 18) (6, 2) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (4, 18, 7, 11, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 13, 15, 19, 4)
        - Cycle 3: (18, 19, 1, 15, 18)
        - Cycle 4: (8, 9, 2, 11, 8)
        - Cycle 5: (8, 16, 5, 2, 8)
        - Cycle 6: (0, 17, 16, 5, 0)
        - Cycle 7: (0, 15, 13, 3, 0)
        - Cycle 8: (16, 5, 2, 6, 16)
        - Cycle 9: (12, 0, 17, 16, 12)
        - Cycle 10: (12, 14, 3, 13, 12)
        - Cycle 11: (19, 15, 13, 4, 19)
        - Cycle 12: (7, 18, 6, 2, 7)
        - Cycle 13: (11, 7, 14, 3, 11)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, 4, 7, 11, 18, 4>
        - <2, 5, 8, 16, 10, 4>
        - <3, 15, 19, 13, 12, 0>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 10 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Final Answer: [10]
