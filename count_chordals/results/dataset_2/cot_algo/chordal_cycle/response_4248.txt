Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.
        - Cycle 1: (5, 4, 12, 2, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 4, 6, 0, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (9, 6, 4, 5, 9)
        - Cycle 4: (9, 6, 3, 10, 7, 14, 9)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 12, 13, 8, 1, 12, 4)
        - Cycle 6: (4, 0, 6, 3, 4)
        - Cycle 7: (7, 12, 13, 14, 7)
        - Cycle 8: (8, 13, 14, 11, 2, 12, 8)
        - Cycle 9: (6, 4, 12, 13, 14, 7, 10, 3, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1 has a chord (12, 2).
        - Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 6).
        - Cycle 3 has a chord (4, 5).
        - Cycle 4 has a chord (6, 9).
        - Cycle 5 has a chord (12, 13).
        - Cycle 6 has a chord (0, 3).
        - Cycle 7 has a chord (12, 13).
        - Cycle 8 has a chord (13, 14).
        - Cycle 9 does not have a chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, (12, 2), 4, 6> because it is the only chordal 4-cycle without any chord.
