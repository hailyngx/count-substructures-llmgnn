Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 28) (9, 12) (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 28) (27, 2) (8, 4) (8, 25) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 21) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 22) (0, 12) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 29) (14, 25) (22, 0) (22, 28) (22, 3) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 17) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 18) (24, 29) (17, 26) (17, 20) (20, 17) (20, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 25) (1, 16) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 3) (19, 13) (16, 1) (21, 4) (21, 13) (21, 2) (11, 5) (11, 24) (11, 18) (11, 12) (3, 22) (3, 19) (3, 29) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 1) (25, 10) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 21) (13, 7) (28, 5) (28, 27) (28, 22) (28, 19) (7, 23) (7, 13) (7, 2) (29, 0) (29, 14) (29, 26) (29, 24) (29, 3) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (10, 23) (10, 25) (18, 24) (18, 11) (2, 27) (2, 21) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (4, 1, 15, 14, 4)
- Cycle 2: (0, 23, 7, 13, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 14, 15, 27, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 22, 28, 19, 3, 0)
- Cycle 5: (24, 26, 17, 20, 19, 28, 22, 24)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: (4, 14, 15, 1, 4) -> Chord: (14, 1)
- Cycle 2: (0, 7, 13, 23, 0) -> Chord: (7, 23)
- Cycle 3: (0, 15, 27, 14, 0) -> Chord: (15, 14)
- Cycle 4: (0, 28, 22, 19, 0) -> Chord: (28, 19)
- Cycle 5: (24, 17, 26, 22, 24) -> Chord: (17, 22)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
