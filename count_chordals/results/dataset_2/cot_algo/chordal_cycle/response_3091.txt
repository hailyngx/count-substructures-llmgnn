Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - The cycles with exactly one chord are:
          - Cycle 1: (4, 0, 3, 1, 4) - Chord: (0, 1)
          - Cycle 5: (7, 0, 3, 10, 7) - Chord: (0, 10)
          - Cycle 10: (1, 6, 4, 12, 1) - Chord: (6, 12)
          - Cycle 16: (13, 7, 0, 12, 13) - Chord: (7, 12)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. 

Therefore, the final count is [4].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are: 
        - <4, (0, 1)>
        - <7, (0, 10)>
        - <1, (6, 12)>
        - <13, (7, 12)>
