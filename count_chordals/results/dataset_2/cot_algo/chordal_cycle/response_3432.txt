Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (3, 27), 25>
- <1, (23, 4), 29>
- <3, (15, 27), 25>
- <8, (16, 25), 19>
- <8, (13, 3), 1>
- <8, (5, 28), 24>
- <13, (8, 5), 19>
- <13, (18, 17), 2>
- <24, (12, 14), 29>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There are [9] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
