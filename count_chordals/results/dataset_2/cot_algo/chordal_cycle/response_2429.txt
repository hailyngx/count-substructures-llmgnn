Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (6, 1, 4, 2, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 2: (6, 1, 5, 13, 9, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 1, 11, 13, 9, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 1, 11, 13, 5, 14, 3, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 3, 14, 10, 0, 9, 6)
- Cycle 6: (9, 13, 5, 1, 6, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 13, 5, 14, 3, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 0, 7, 8, 2, 4, 1, 9)
- Cycle 9: (4, 1, 11, 12, 5, 3, 14, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 1, 11, 12, 5, 14, 10, 0, 7, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 1, 11, 12, 5, 14, 3, 6, 9, 0, 7, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <6, (1, 4), 2, 8, 7>
- <1, (6, 5), 13, 9>
- <1, (6, 11), 13, 9>
- <1, (6, 11), 13, (5, 14), 3, 6>
- <6, (9, 7), 8, 2, 4>
- <9, (6, 5), 13, 5>
- <9, (6, 5), 13, (3, 14)>
- <9, (0, 7), 8, 2, 4>
- <4, (1, 12), 11, 5>
- <4, (1, 12), 11, (5, 14), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
