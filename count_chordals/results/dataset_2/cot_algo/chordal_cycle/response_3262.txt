Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 15) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 18) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 18) (16, 15) (16, 0) (11, 4) (11, 0) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 13) (6, 8) (6, 18) (2, 7) (1, 19) (1, 8) (1, 18) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 3-5-4-11-0-13-17-3
- Cycle 2: 8-6-13-17-14-4-11-0-8
- Cycle 3: 10-18-1-8-15-16-0-11-4-14-17-10
- Cycle 4: 15-9-19-1-8-6-18-10-15
- Cycle 5: 15-9-19-3-17-14-4-11-0-16-15
- Cycle 6: 12-3-5-4-14-17-13-12
- Cycle 7: 7-2-10-18-6-13-0-11-4-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has a chord (4, 17)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (13, 4)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (8, 10)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1, 15)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (14, 9)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (4, 17)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (10, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, 5, 4, 11, 0, 13, 17, 3>
- <8, 6, 13, 17, 14, 4, 11, 0, 8>
- <10, 18, 1, 8, 15, 16, 0, 11, 4, 14, 17, 10>
- <15, 9, 19, 1, 8, 6, 18, 10, 15>
- <15, 9, 19, 3, 17, 14, 4, 11, 0, 16, 15>
- <12, 3, 5, 4, 14, 17, 13, 12>
- <7, 2, 10, 18, 6, 13, 0, 11, 4, 7>
