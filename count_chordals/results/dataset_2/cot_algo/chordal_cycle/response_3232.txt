Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 21) (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 12) (6, 11) (23, 22) (23, 25) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 29) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 18) (20, 2) (14, 0) (14, 25) (28, 9) (28, 29) (1, 17) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 4) (29, 0) (29, 28) (29, 15) (29, 4) (29, 10) (3, 26) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 16) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 21) (17, 1) (17, 24) (21, 22) (21, 11) (8, 20) (8, 24) (8, 12) (25, 23) (25, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 18) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 2) (24, 17) (24, 8) (24, 19) (2, 0) (2, 20) (2, 16) (2, 15) (19, 24) (19, 10) (7, 5) (7, 26) (7, 27) (15, 29) (15, 2) (15, 18) (10, 13) (10, 29) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 4) (27, 7) (18, 13) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 15) (4, 0) (4, 26) (4, 29) (4, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (13, 22, 23, 25, 14, 0, 20, 18, 13)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 9, 28, 29, 15, 2, 0, 4, 26, 7, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (6, 11, 21, 22, 13, 18, 20, 8, 12, 9, 6)
        - Cycle 4: (3, 26, 4, 0, 14, 25, 23, 22, 21, 11, 3)
        - Cycle 5: (16, 12, 8, 20, 0, 2, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Checking Cycle 1: (13, 23) is a chord
        - Checking Cycle 2: No chord found
        - Checking Cycle 3: (6, 21) is a chord
        - Checking Cycle 4: No chord found
        - Checking Cycle 5: No chord found

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        - <1, (13, 23), 25, 14>
        - <2, 0, 4, 26, 7, 5>
        - <3, 26, 4, 0, 14, 25, 23, 22, 21, 11>
