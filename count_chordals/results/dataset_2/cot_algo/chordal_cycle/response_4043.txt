Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 8, 7, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 6, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 6, 8, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 9, 6, 5, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 9, 6, 7, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 9, 4, 2, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 9, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 8: (2, 9, 4, 7, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 9, 4, 1, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 3, 0, 8, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 3, 8, 5, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 8, 5, 6, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 8, 6, 5, 2)
- Cycle 14: (3, 0, 8, 5, 3)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 10 has 0 chords
- Cycle 11 has 0 chords
- Cycle 12 has 0 chords
- Cycle 13 has 0 chords
- Cycle 14 has 0 chords

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [8].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <1, (1, 8), 8>
2. <2, (5, 6), 7>
3. <3, (5, 8), 6>
4. <4, (9, 5), 1>
5. <5, (6, 7), 1>
6. <6, (4, 9), 1>
7. <7, (4, 7), 2>
8. <8, (4, 7), 9>
