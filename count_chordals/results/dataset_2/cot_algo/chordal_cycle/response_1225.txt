- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 0, 1, 17)
- Cycle 4: (5, 16, 17, 1, 0)
- Cycle 5: (9, 8, 15, 14, 3)
- Cycle 6: (9, 4, 14, 15, 6)
- Cycle 7: (11, 3, 14, 15, 6)
- Cycle 8: (11, 2, 18, 0, 1)
- Cycle 9: (2, 9, 8, 15, 14)
- Cycle 10: (2, 11, 3, 14, 15)
- Cycle 11: (2, 18, 0, 1, 17)
- Cycle 12: (18, 10, 6, 15, 14)
- Cycle 13: (18, 2, 9, 8, 15)
- Cycle 14: (18, 0, 1, 17, 16)
- Cycle 15: (7, 0, 1, 17, 16)
- Cycle 16: (7, 0, 18, 2, 6)
- Cycle 17: (0, 18, 2, 11, 3)
- Cycle 18: (0, 1, 17, 16, 5)
- Cycle 19: (0, 7, 5, 9, 8)
- Cycle 20: (0, 15, 14, 3, 11)
- Cycle 21: (17, 1, 0, 7, 5)
- Cycle 22: (8, 9, 2, 18, 0)
- Cycle 23: (8, 15, 14, 3, 11)

- Cycle 34: (14, 15, 6, 10, 18)
- Cycle 35: (4, 9, 2, 11, 3)
- Cycle 36: (15, 0, 7, 5, 16)
- Cycle 37: (13, 12, 16, 17, 1)
- Cycle 38: (6, 10, 18, 0, 1)

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (0, 18), 17>
- <2, (9, 8), 15>
- <3, (14, 15), 6>
- <16, (13, 19), 12>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [34].
