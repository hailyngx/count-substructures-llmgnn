Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 5 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 3 - 2 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 3: 3 - 7 - 8 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 4: 6 - 7 - 3 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 5: 0 - 6 - 4 - 9 - 0

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (1, 5).
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (6, 9).

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 5, 2, 0>
- <6, 9, 4, 0>
