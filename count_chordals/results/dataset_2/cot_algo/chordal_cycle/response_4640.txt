Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 16) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 18) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (17, 13) (17, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 16) (18, 15) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 16) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 2) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<Cycles with 4 nodes>
- (3, 15, 6, 7, 3)
- (11, 0, 12, 5, 11)
- (5, 6, 15, 16, 5)
- (2, 4, 19, 16, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

<Chordal 4-cycles>
- <1, (6, 16), 5>
- <2, (0, 5), 11>
- <3, (5, 19), 16>
- <4, (2, 16), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
