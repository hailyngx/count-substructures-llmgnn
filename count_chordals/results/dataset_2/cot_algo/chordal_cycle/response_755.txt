Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
Here are some cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 9-6-7-12-9
- Cycle 2: 9-6-11-0-9
- Cycle 3: 9-6-7-0-9
- Cycle 4: 9-6-0-11-9
- Cycle 5: 9-6-0-3-9
- Cycle 6: 9-6-11-3-9
- Cycle 7: 9-4-14-13-9
- Cycle 8: 12-7-6-9-12
- Cycle 9: 12-7-0-11-12
- Cycle 10: 12-7-0-3-12
- Cycle 11: 12-7-0-6-12
- Cycle 12: 4-9-6-7-4
- Cycle 13: 4-9-3-12-4
- Cycle 14: 4-9-3-0-4
- Cycle 15: 4-9-6-0-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has a chord: 6-0.
- Cycle 3 has a chord: 6-0.
- Cycle 4 has a chord: 6-11.
- Cycle 5 has a chord: 6-3.
- Cycle 6 has a chord: 6-11.
- Cycle 7 has no chords.
- Cycle 8 has no chords.
- Cycle 9 has no chords.
- Cycle 10 has a chord: 7-0.
- Cycle 11 has a chord: 7-0.
- Cycle 12 has a chord: 4-7.
- Cycle 13 has a chord: 4-9.
- Cycle 14 has a chord: 4-9.
- Cycle 15 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
As per the above analysis, there are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final count is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <2, (6, 0), 11, 9>
- <3, (6, 0), 7, 9>
- <4, (6, 11), 0, 9>
- <5, (6, 3), 0, 9>
- <6, (6, 11), 3, 9>
- <7, 4, 9, 3, 12>
