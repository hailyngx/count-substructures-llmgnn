Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-7-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-7-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-8-7-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-8-9-1
- Cycle 5: 1-9-7-8-1
- Cycle 6: 1-9-8-7-1
- Cycle 7: 2-7-8-9-2
- Cycle 8: 2-7-9-8-2
- Cycle 9: 3-4-7-8-3
- Cycle 10: 3-6-8-7-3
- Cycle 11: 3-6-8-9-3
- Cycle 12: 3-7-4-1-3
- Cycle 13: 3-7-8-9-3
- Cycle 14: 3-9-8-7-3
- Cycle 15: 4-1-6-8-4
- Cycle 16: 4-1-9-7-4
- Cycle 17: 4-3-6-8-4
- Cycle 18: 4-3-7-9-4
- Cycle 19: 5-1-6-8-5
- Cycle 20: 5-1-9-7-5
- Cycle 21: 6-0-3-4-6
- Cycle 22: 6-1-4-7-6
- Cycle 23: 6-8-7-4-6
- Cycle 24: 6-8-9-7-6
- Cycle 25: 7-2-1-4-7
- Cycle 26: 7-2-3-4-7
- Cycle 27: 7-3-0-6-7
- Cycle 28: 7-3-4-1-7
- Cycle 29: 8-0-6-1-8
- Cycle 30: 8-5-1-4-8
- Cycle 31: 8-5-1-9-8
- Cycle 32: 8-5-1-9-7-8
- Cycle 33: 8-5-1-6-8
- Cycle 34: 9-1-4-7-9
- Cycle 35: 9-1-6-8-9
- Cycle 36: 9-3-4-7-9
- Cycle 37: 9-8-7-4-9
- Cycle 38: 9-8-7-1-9
- Cycle 39: 9-8-6-1-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (2, 7), 4>
- <1, (8, 7), 9>
- <1, (6, 8), 9>
- <1, (6, 8), 7>
- <1, (9, 8), 7>
- <2, (8, 7), 9>
- <3, (4, 7), 8>
- <3, (6, 8), 7>
- <3, (6, 8), 9>
- <4, (1, 6), 8>
- <8, (5, 1), 4>
- <8, (5, 1), 9>
- <9, (8, 7), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
