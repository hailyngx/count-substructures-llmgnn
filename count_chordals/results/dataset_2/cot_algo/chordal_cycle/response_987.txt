Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 18) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 14) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 15) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 18) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 17) (17, 9) (17, 19) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 13) (16, 15) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 10, 11, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 5, 11, 10, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 3, 0, 11, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 2, 1, 3, 6)
- Cycle 5: (9, 10, 11, 13, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 18, 3, 1, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 17, 19, 5, 9)
- Cycle 8: (1, 3, 0, 4, 1)
- Cycle 9: (3, 6, 5, 11, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 1, 14, 4, 3)
- Cycle 11: (10, 11, 13, 8, 10)
- Cycle 12: (11, 0, 3, 1, 11)
- Cycle 13: (11, 5, 15, 12, 11)
- Cycle 14: (8, 13, 7, 8)
- Cycle 15: (8, 15, 16, 12, 8)
- Cycle 16: (13, 8, 15, 5, 13)
- Cycle 17: (4, 12, 15, 5, 4)
- Cycle 18: (4, 19, 17, 9, 4)
- Cycle 19: (5, 6, 9, 17, 5)
- Cycle 20: (0, 3, 1, 2, 0)
- Cycle 21: (0, 11, 5, 15, 0)
- Cycle 22: (0, 4, 12, 8, 0)
- Cycle 23: (14, 1, 2, 18, 14)
- Cycle 24: (2, 6, 3, 1, 2)
- Cycle 25: (18, 9, 10, 11, 18)
- Cycle 26: (19, 4, 0, 11, 19)
- Cycle 27: (17, 9, 10, 11, 17)
- Cycle 28: (12, 8, 13, 7, 12)
- Cycle 29: (15, 8, 13, 7, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (3, 6), 2>
- <3, (1, 9), 6>
- <4, (12, 15), 5>
- <5, (6, 9), 11>
- <8, (13, 15), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are [0] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
