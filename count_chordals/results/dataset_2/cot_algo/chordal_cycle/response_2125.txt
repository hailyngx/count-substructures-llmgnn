Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 28) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 25) (21, 15) (10, 15) (10, 4) (11, 29) (11, 20) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 27) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 6) (20, 11) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 19) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 6) (19, 20) (19, 26) (19, 25) (19, 24) (28, 7) (28, 8) (6, 0) (6, 26) (6, 23) (15, 21) (15, 10) (15, 12) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 22) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 13) (2, 14) (22, 8) (22, 5) (5, 26) (5, 22) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 4) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 16) (12, 15) (12, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 23) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 12) (29, 11) (29, 0) (18, 1) (18, 27) (18, 24) (27, 1) (27, 18) (27, 13) (13, 9) (13, 16) (13, 27) (24, 19) (24, 9) (24, 18) (25, 21) (25, 0) (25, 19) (23, 21) (23, 6) (23, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - (7, 21, 15, 10)
        - (7, 21, 25, 0)
        - (7, 21, 23, 6)
        - (7, 16, 4, 3)
        - (15, 10, 4, 16)
        - (15, 10, 3, 4)
        - (8, 28, 7, 21)
        - (8, 28, 7, 16)
        - (8, 28, 7, 15)
        - (8, 28, 14, 3)
        - (8, 14, 3, 4)
        - (8, 14, 3, 17)
        - (8, 14, 9, 24)
        - (8, 14, 9, 13)
        - (8, 14, 12, 15)
        - (10, 15, 12, 14)
        - (10, 4, 3, 17)
        - (15, 12, 14, 8)
        - (21, 23, 17, 3)
        - (21, 23, 6, 26)
        - (21, 25, 0, 20)
        - (21, 25, 19, 20)
        - (21, 25, 19, 24)
        - (23, 17, 0, 25)
        - (23, 17, 3, 4)
        - (23, 17, 0, 20)
        - (26, 6, 0, 20)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - The chordal 4-cycles are as follows:
        - <7, (15, 10), 21>
        - <7, (25, 0), 21>
        - <7, (21, 23), 6>
        - <7, (7, 16), 4>
        - <10, (15, 12), 14>
        - <8, (28, 7), 21>
        - <8, (14, 3), 4>
        - <8, (14, 9), 24>
        - <8, (14, 12), 15>
        - <15, (12, 14), 10>
        - <21, (23, 17), 3>
        - <21, (25, 19), 20>
        - <21, (23, 17), 0>
        - <23, (17, 0), 25>
        - <26, (6, 0), 20>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
