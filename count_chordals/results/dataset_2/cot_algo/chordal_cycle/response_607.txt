Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 12) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 18) (0, 5) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 18) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 7) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 16) (4, 9) (4, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 18) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 3-15-1-12-3
- Cycle 2: 3-15-10-2-3
- Cycle 3: 3-2-6-12-3
- Cycle 4: 3-2-14-18-3
- Cycle 5: 15-1-12-6-15
- Cycle 6: 15-1-12-11-15
- Cycle 7: 15-10-16-19-15
- Cycle 8: 15-10-2-6-15
- Cycle 9: 6-5-0-14-6
- Cycle 10: 6-5-14-18-6
- Cycle 11: 6-2-10-15-6
- Cycle 12: 6-2-10-16-6
- Cycle 13: 6-12-1-15-6
- Cycle 14: 6-12-11-4-6
- Cycle 15: 6-12-11-8-6
- Cycle 16: 9-4-11-8-9
- Cycle 17: 5-6-2-10-5
- Cycle 18: 5-6-12-1-5
- Cycle 19: 5-14-18-16-5
- Cycle 20: 2-3-15-1-2
- ...

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, (15, 1), 12, 1>
- <3, (15, 10), 2, 10>
- <3, (2, 6), 12, 6>
- <3, (2, 14), 18, 14>
- <15, (1, 12), 6, 12>
- <15, (1, 12), 11, 12>
- <15, (10, 16), 19, 16>
- <15, (10, 2), 6, 10>
- ...
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are a total of [10] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
