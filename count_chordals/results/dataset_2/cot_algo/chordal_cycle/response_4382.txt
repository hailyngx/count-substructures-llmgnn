Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 10) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 10) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: 6-1-5-2-6
        - Cycle 2: 6-2-5-8-6
        - Cycle 3: 6-0-7-4-6
        - Cycle 4: 6-0-7-13-9-6
        - Cycle 5: 6-0-11-5-2-6
        - Cycle 6: 9-1-5-2-9
        - Cycle 7: 9-1-5-8-9
        - Cycle 8: 9-14-12-5-2-9
        - Cycle 9: 9-14-12-5-8-9
        - Cycle 10: 9-14-10-3-1-9
        - Cycle 11: 9-14-10-3-5-9
        - Cycle 12: 4-0-7-13-4
        - Cycle 13: 4-0-11-5-4
        - Cycle 14: 4-8-5-2-4
        - Cycle 15: 4-8-5-12-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        <6, (14, 2), 9>
        <6, (2, 8), 5>
        <6, (7, 13), 0>
        <6, (7, 13), 9>
        <6, (11, 5), 0>
        <9, (1, 5), 2>
        <9, (1, 5), 8>
        <9, (12, 5), 14>
        <9, (12, 5), 8>
        <9, (10, 3), 14>
        <9, (10, 3), 5>
        <4, (7, 13), 0>
        <4, (7, 13), 11>
        <4, (5, 2), 8>
        <4, (5, 12), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
