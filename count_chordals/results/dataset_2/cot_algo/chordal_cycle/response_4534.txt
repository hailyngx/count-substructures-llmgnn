Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-1-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-3-9-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-3-4-6-0
- Cycle 4: 1-5-3-4-1
- Cycle 5: 1-2-8-6-1
- Cycle 6: 1-2-8-3-1
- Cycle 7: 4-9-7-6-4
- Cycle 8: 4-9-3-8-4

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges) are:
- <1, (2, 4), 5> - Chord: (2, 4)
- <2, (1, 3), 5> - Chord: (1, 3)
- <3, (5, 9), 4> - Chord: (5, 9)
- <4, (3, 1), 9> - Chord: (3, 1)
- <5, (0, 3), 9> - Chord: (0, 3)
- <6, (1, 8), 4> - Chord: (1, 8)
- <7, (0, 9), 6> - Chord: (0, 9)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
