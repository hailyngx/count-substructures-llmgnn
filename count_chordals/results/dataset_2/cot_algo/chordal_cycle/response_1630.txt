Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 15) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 17) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 16) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 8) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 7) (18, 5) (18, 13) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles in the given graph. We will list the cycles of length 4 or more:

1. Cycle: 1-3-17-2-1
2. Cycle: 3-4-11-15-3
3. Cycle: 10-11-15-12-10
4. Cycle: 5-10-11-4-5
5. Cycle: 8-10-11-4-8
6. Cycle: 8-9-1-3-8
7. Cycle: 7-1-3-4-7
8. Cycle: 16-10-11-15-16
9. Cycle: 16-7-1-9-16
10. Cycle: 13-0-5-19-13

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (3, 17), 2>
- <3, (4, 11), 15>
- <10, (11, 15), 12>
- <5, (10, 11), 4>
- <8, (10, 11), 4>
- <8, (9, 1), 3>
- <7, (1, 3), 4>
- <16, (10, 11), 15>
- <16, (7, 1), 9>
- <13, (0, 5), 19>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found = [0]
