Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 17) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (19, 5) (19, 7) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 17) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 8) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 10) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 15) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 12) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <5, (3, 14), 18>.

Step 1:
- Cycle 1: 5-4-6-2-5
- Cycle 2: 8-2-3-5-8
- Cycle 3: 8-15-7-3-8
- Cycle 4: 8-16-15-7-8
- Cycle 5: 8-9-17-13-8
- Cycle 6: 8-9-17-12-8
- Cycle 7: 13-17-0-18-13
- Cycle 8: 13-17-15-7-13
- Cycle 9: 5-11-18-0-5
- Cycle 10: 5-11-12-1-5

Step 2:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (3, 14) which is a valid chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
- The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
