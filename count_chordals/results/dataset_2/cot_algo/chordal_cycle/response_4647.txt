Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 12) (11, 4) (11, 13) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 1, 3, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 12, 3, 4, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 2, 4, 6)
- Cycle 4: (7, 12, 9, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 12, 3, 5, 0, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 14, 13, 4, 11, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 14, 13, 2, 6, 9, 12, 7)
- Cycle 8: (1, 3, 12, 9, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 10, 7, 12, 9, 1)
- Cycle 10: (3, 12, 0, 5, 3)
- Cycle 11: (0, 7, 14, 13, 11, 4, 3, 0)
- Cycle 12: (0, 5, 3, 12, 0)
- Cycle 13: (2, 4, 11, 13, 2)
- Cycle 14: (2, 13, 10, 1, 3, 12, 2)
- Cycle 15: (8, 12, 3, 4, 2, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1: Chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 2: Chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 3: Chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 4: Chord (1, 0)
- Cycle 5: Chord (12, 7)
- Cycle 6: Chord (7, 13)
- Cycle 7: Chord (6, 12)
- Cycle 8: Chord (9, 12)
- Cycle 9: Chord (9, 12)
- Cycle 10: Chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 11: Chord (7, 13)
- Cycle 12: Chord (0, 3)
- Cycle 13: Chord (11, 13)
- Cycle 14: Chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 15: Chord (12, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are a total of [15] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 4, 6, 9>
<1, 0, 7, 12>
<4, 6, 9, 12>
<1, 3, 5, 7>
<7, 11, 13, 14>
<6, 9, 12, 7>
<9, 12, 7, 10, 13, 2>
<3, 12, 5, 0>
<0, 5, 3, 12>
<2, 13, 10, 1>
<8, 12, 4, 3>
