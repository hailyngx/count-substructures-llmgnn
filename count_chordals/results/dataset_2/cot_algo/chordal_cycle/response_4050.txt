Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 10) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 10) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) (12, 3) (12, 11) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 7) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-5
- Cycle 2: 1-3-9-4-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-8-1
- Cycle 4: 1-0-14-3-1
- Cycle 5: 3-14-0-10-3
- Cycle 6: 14-13-2-11-14
- Cycle 7: 5-13-2-14-5
- Cycle 8: 6-11-2-14-6
- Cycle 9: 9-11-7-14-9

Step 2:  
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord 9-6
- Cycle 2 has a chord 9-4
- Cycle 3 has a chord 4-8
- Cycle 4 has a chord 0-14
- Cycle 5 has a chord 0-10
- Cycle 6 has a chord 13-11
- Cycle 7 has a chord 13-2
- Cycle 8 has a chord 11-2
- Cycle 9 has a chord 11-7

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:  
There are total 9 chordal 4-cycles.  

Therefore, the final count of chordless cycles is [0].  
And the unique chordal 4-cycles are:  
<Cycle 1: (9-6)>  
<Cycle 2: (9-4)>  
<Cycle 3: (4-8)>  
<Cycle 4: (0-14)>  
<Cycle 5: (0-10)>  
<Cycle 6: (13-11)>  
<Cycle 7: (13-2)>  
<Cycle 8: (11-2)>  
<Cycle 9: (11-7)>
