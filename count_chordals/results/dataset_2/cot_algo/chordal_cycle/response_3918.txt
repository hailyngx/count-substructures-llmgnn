Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 0) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 10) (1, 21) (1, 0) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 12) (6, 17) (6, 25) (9, 16) (9, 21) (9, 14) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 25) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (4, 12) (4, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (20, 29) (20, 3) (2, 8) (2, 28) (2, 25) (19, 13) (19, 26) (19, 23) (26, 19) (26, 7) (26, 17) (17, 6) (17, 26) (17, 29) (17, 22) (29, 20) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 12) (28, 11) (28, 2) (28, 5) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 23) (25, 6) (25, 8) (25, 2) (25, 7) (10, 16) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 24) (27, 29) (27, 3) (12, 21) (12, 4) (12, 29) (12, 18) (3, 20) (3, 27) (3, 14) (3, 22) (5, 15) (5, 28) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 24) (0, 11) (0, 1) (24, 10) (24, 14) (24, 22) (18, 16) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 12) (22, 17) (22, 3) (22, 24) (23, 19) (23, 7) 

Response:
With the given graph, let's find all the chordal 4-cycles step-by-step:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists
- (1, 21, 9, 16)
- (1, 21, 12, 4)
- (1, 7, 13, 8)
- (21, 9, 14, 3)
- (21, 12, 29, 17)
- (21, 12, 4, 18)
- (21, 9, 16, 18)
- (1, 7, 25, 6)
- (1, 0, 11, 28)
- (21, 1, 0, 11)
- (21, 1, 7, 13)
- (9, 16, 18, 4)
- (9, 21, 1, 0)
- (9, 21, 12, 18)
- (9, 21, 1, 7)
- (16, 18, 4, 12)
- (16, 9, 14, 24)
- (16, 9, 21, 12)
- (16, 18, 12, 29)
- (7, 1, 21, 9)
- (7, 13, 19, 26)
- (7, 25, 2, 8)
- (7, 26, 19, 23)
- (21, 9, 14, 24)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord
- <1, 21, 9, 16> (Chord: 21, 9)
- <1, 21, 12, 4> (Chord: 21, 12)
- <1, 7, 13, 8> (Chord: 13, 8)
- <21, 9, 14, 3> (Chord: 9, 14)
- <21, 12, 29, 17> (Chord: 12, 17)
- <21, 12, 4, 18> (Chord: 12, 4)
- <9, 21, 1, 7> (Chord: 21, 7)
- <16, 9, 14, 24> (Chord: 9, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found
- There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, hence the final count is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, 21, 9, 16>
- <1, 21, 12, 4>
- <1, 7, 13, 8>
- <21, 9, 14, 3>
- <21, 12, 29, 17>
- <21, 12, 4, 18>
- <16, 9, 14, 24>
