Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 13) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-7-12-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-8-5-13-1
- Cycle 3: 1-11-2-12-1
- Cycle 4: 1-14-13-5-1
- Cycle 5: 7-12-2-13-7
- Cycle 6: 2-9-7-12-2
- Cycle 7: 2-13-5-8-2
- Cycle 8: 8-0-7-12-8
- Cycle 9: 8-5-13-2-8
- Cycle 10: 5-0-4-12-5
- Cycle 11: 5-13-14-1-5
- Cycle 12: 13-5-0-4-13
- Cycle 13: 13-2-12-4-13
- Cycle 14: 0-8-1-11-0
- Cycle 15: 0-4-9-7-0
- Cycle 16: 9-2-12-4-9
- Cycle 17: 4-0-8-1-4
- Cycle 18: 4-9-2-13-4
- Cycle 19: 4-10-6-14-4
- Cycle 20: 11-1-8-5-11
- Cycle 21: 14-1-11-2-14
- Cycle 22: 6-14-13-2-6
- Cycle 23: 10-6-14-1-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 7, 2, 12, 1> contains exactly one chord (7-2).
- <1, 8, 5, 13, 1> contains exactly one chord (8-13).
- <4, 9, 2, 13, 4> contains exactly one chord (9-13).
- <5, 0, 4, 12, 5> contains exactly one chord (0-12).
- <11, 1, 8, 5, 11> contains exactly one chord (1-5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 18 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [18].
