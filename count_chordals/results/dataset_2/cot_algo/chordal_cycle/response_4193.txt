Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 18) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (10, 13) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 0) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 18) (19, 15) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 18) (2, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 11) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 3-15-4-7-3
        - Cycle 2: 3-15-19-4-3
        - Cycle 3: 4-7-17-13-4
        - Cycle 4: 7-1-14-11-7
        - Cycle 5: 8-13-17-0-8
        - Cycle 6: 8-13-10-18-8
        - Cycle 7: 1-7-4-9-1
        - Cycle 8: 1-7-8-11-1
        - Cycle 9: 12-3-15-19-12
        - Cycle 10: 12-1-7-17-12
        - Cycle 11: 12-16-0-17-12
        - Cycle 12: 12-18-13-17-12
        - Cycle 13: 15-19-15
        - Cycle 14: 16-0-17-7-16
        - Cycle 15: 16-0-8-5-16
        - Cycle 16: 16-12-18-6-16
        - Cycle 17: 18-13-17-0-18

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has chord (4, 7)
        - Cycle 2 has chord (15, 19)
        - Cycle 3 has chord (7, 17)
        - Cycle 4 has chord (1, 11)
        - Cycle 5 has chord (13, 17)
        - Cycle 6 has chord (13, 10)
        - Cycle 7 has chord (7, 9)
        - Cycle 8 has chord (7, 8)
        - Cycle 9 has chord (15, 19)
        - Cycle 10 has chord (7, 17)
        - Cycle 11 has chord (0, 17)
        - Cycle 12 has chord (13, 17)
        - Cycle 16 has chord (12, 18)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Putting in the final notation, we have [12].
Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <3, 4, 7, 15>
        <3, 15, 19, 4>
        <4, 7, 13, 17>
        <7, 1, 11, 14>
        <8, 13, 17, 0>
        <8, 13, 10, 18>
        <1, 4, 7, 9>
        <1, 7, 8, 11>
        <3, 12, 15, 19>
        <1, 7, 12, 17>
        <0, 12, 16, 17>
        <12, 16, 18, 6>
