Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:

1. Cycle: 5-9-4-6-5
2. Cycle: 6-7-1-5-6

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:

1. Cycle 5-9-4-6-5 has one chord (4, 6).
2. Cycle 6-7-1-5-6 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].

List of unique chordal 4-cycle:
<5, 9, (4, 6), 6>
