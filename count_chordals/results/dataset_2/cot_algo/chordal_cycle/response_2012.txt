Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 28) (6, 5) (6, 19) (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 12) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 11) (4, 25) (4, 17) (18, 10) (18, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 16) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 25) (0, 2) (0, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 13) (27, 9) (27, 10) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 21) (25, 4) (25, 28) (25, 11) (21, 16) (21, 19) (21, 12) (21, 14) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 29) (24, 3) (24, 12) (24, 19) (3, 18) (3, 24) (23, 14) (23, 29) (11, 20) (11, 25) (22, 5) (22, 17) (22, 12) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 24) (12, 22) (12, 14) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 22) (13, 20) (13, 1) (13, 29) (13, 14) (29, 10) (29, 23) (29, 13) (29, 14) (14, 21) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 29) (19, 6) (19, 21) (19, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle: <1, (15, 28), 5, 20>
- Cycle: <12, (21, 14), 22, 24>
- Cycle: <12, (14, 21), 22, 24>
- Cycle: <13, (1, 29), 14, 20>
- Cycle: <13, (14, 29), 29, 20>
- Cycle: <14, (21, 29), 13, 12>
- Cycle: <14, (29, 21), 13, 12>
- Cycle: <20, (1, 13), 13, 15>
- Cycle: <20, (13, 1), 13, 15>
  
Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (15, 28), 5, 20>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <12, (21, 14), 22, 24>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <13, (1, 29), 14, 20>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <14, (21, 29), 13, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <20, (1, 13), 13, 15>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [5].
