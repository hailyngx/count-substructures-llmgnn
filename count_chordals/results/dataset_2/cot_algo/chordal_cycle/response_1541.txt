Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 13) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (8, 14) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 15) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 19) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (2, 8) (2, 19) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 16) (19, 0) (19, 2) (12, 18) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 7) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 11) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 13, 9, 14, 8, 2, 19)
- Cycle 2: (1, 15, 6, 5, 9, 13, 3, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 18, 17, 15, 10, 0, 13, 3)
- Cycle 4: (7, 1, 15, 17, 18, 4, 3, 13)
- Cycle 5: (10, 5, 9, 14, 17, 15, 6, 15)
- Cycle 6: (11, 14, 9, 13, 0, 10, 16, 4)
- Cycle 7: (12, 18, 17, 14, 9, 5, 10, 16)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges):
- Cycle 1 has the chord: (9, 14)
- Cycle 2 has the chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 3 has the chord: (15, 10)
- Cycle 4 has the chord: (15, 17)
- Cycle 5 has the chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 6 has the chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle 7 has the chord: (9, 17)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 2, 8, 14>
<1, 3, 4, 15>
<4, 10, 13, 17>
<7, 11, 14, 18>
<5, 6, 9, 13>
<9, 10, 14, 16>
<5, 9, 14, 17>
