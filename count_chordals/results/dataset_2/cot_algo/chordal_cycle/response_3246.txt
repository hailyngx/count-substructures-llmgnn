Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 18) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3) (13, 12) (13, 11) (15, 16) (15, 0) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 10) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (14, 2) (14, 12) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 9) (17, 6) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 6) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 19) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 18) (10, 2) (10, 16) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- (0, 5, 9, 8, 0)  
- (0, 6, 17, 9, 8, 0)  
- (1, 4, 18, 6, 11, 13, 12, 1)  
- (2, 8, 9, 17, 6, 11, 13, 12, 2)  
- (2, 8, 9, 17, 6, 18, 4, 1, 12, 2)  
- (2, 8, 18, 6, 11, 13, 12, 1, 19, 2)  
- (2, 14, 12, 13, 11, 6, 17, 9, 8, 2)  
- (5, 0, 15, 16, 7, 2, 8, 9, 17, 6, 0)  
- (5, 0, 15, 16, 10, 2, 7, 18, 4, 1, 12, 13, 11, 6, 17, 9, 5)  
- (5, 3, 18, 6, 11, 13, 12, 1, 4, 18, 3)

Step 2:  
Chordal cycles found:  
- <0, (8, 9), 5, (17, 6)>  
- <1, (4, 18), 6, (11, 13)>  
- <2, (8, 9), 17, (6, 11)>  
- <2, (8, 18), 6, (11, 13)>  
- <5, (0, 15), 16, (7, 2)>  

Step 3:  
Number of unique chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
