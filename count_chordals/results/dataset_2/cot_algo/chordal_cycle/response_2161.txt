Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 17) (14, 11) (14, 15) (17, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 13) (10, 19) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 18) (8, 19) (8, 0) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 11) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 18) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 13) (4, 0) (4, 13) (15, 9) (15, 14) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 4) (18, 7) (18, 6) (18, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 3, 12, 2, 7, 13, 10)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 3, 12, 6, 5, 6, 12)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 2, 12, 6, 18, 16, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 1, 2, 9, 17, 9, 11, 13)
- Cycle 5: (0, 1, 2, 12, 3, 6, 18, 16)
- Cycle 6: (0, 1, 2, 12, 3, 6, 18, 7)
- Cycle 7: (0, 1, 3, 12, 6, 18, 16, 13)
- Cycle 8: (0, 1, 3, 12, 6, 18, 7, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Only Cycle 8 has exactly one chord (7, 18).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, 1, 3, 12, 6, 18, 7, 13>
