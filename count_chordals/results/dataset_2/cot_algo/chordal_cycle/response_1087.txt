Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 2) (13, 9) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-8-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-14-0-3-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-2-3-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 5, 14, 3> has one chord: (1, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

List of unique chordal 4-cycle: <1, 5, 8, 4>, <1, 6, 2, 3>
