Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- There are no cycles of length 4 or more without chords in this graph.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- There is a unique 4-cycle with a chord in this graph:
  <1, (2, 4), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- Since there are no chordless cycles in this graph, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
