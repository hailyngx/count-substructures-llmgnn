Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 7) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-6-9-4-0
- Cycle 2: 1-4-7-0-1
- Cycle 3: 1-2-9-13-1
- Cycle 4: 1-8-6-0-1
- Cycle 5: 2-3-14-13-2
- Cycle 6: 2-7-4-1-2
- Cycle 7: 3-12-10-1-3
- Cycle 8: 4-5-8-1-4
- Cycle 9: 5-10-12-3-5
- Cycle 10: 5-11-7-4-5
- Cycle 11: 7-10-12-5-7
- Cycle 12: 9-13-14-3-9

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 7), 0> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (4, 7).

Step 3:
The final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
