Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-7-0-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-3-6-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-9-6-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-8-2-5
- Cycle 5: 5-1-3-4-5
- Cycle 6: 5-1-7-2-5
- Cycle 7: 9-1-3-6-9
- Cycle 8: 9-1-7-2-9
- Cycle 9: 9-1-5-8-9
- Cycle 10: 6-2-4-3-6
- Cycle 11: 6-2-7-1-6
- Cycle 12: 6-2-5-8-6
- Cycle 13: 4-2-7-3-4
- Cycle 14: 4-2-5-8-4
- Cycle 15: 7-1-3-0-7
- Cycle 16: 7-1-5-2-7
- Cycle 17: 1-5-8-2-1
- Cycle 18: 1-5-2-7-1
- Cycle 19: 1-5-8-0-1
- Cycle 20: 3-1-8-0-3
- Cycle 21: 3-1-7-0-3
- Cycle 22: 3-1-5-2-3
- Cycle 23: 3-1-9-6-3
- Cycle 24: 2-5-8-0-2
- Cycle 25: 2-5-1-7-2
- Cycle 26: 2-5-9-6-2
- Cycle 27: 8-5-1-7-8
- Cycle 28: 8-5-2-7-8
- Cycle 29: 0-7-3-1-0
- Cycle 30: 0-7-2-5-0
- Cycle 31: 0-7-1-5-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (2, 4)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (2, 7)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (2, 7)
- Cycle 14 has a chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 15 has a chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 16 has a chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 17 has a chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 18 has a chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 19 has a chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 20 has a chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 21 has a chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 22 has a chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 23 has a chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 24 has a chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 25 has a chord: (2, 7)
- Cycle 26 has a chord: (2, 9)
- Cycle 27 has a chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 28 has a chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 29 has a chord: (7, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 31 cycles in total, out of which 3 cycles do not have chords.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (1, 7), 0)>
<9, (1, 9), 6)>
<2, (2, 4), 3)>
