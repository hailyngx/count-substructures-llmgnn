Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-10-8-2-13-1
- Cycle 3: 1-10-8-7-3-1
- Cycle 4: 1-10-8-9-11-1
- Cycle 5: 1-4-12-11-1
- Cycle 6: 3-7-11-8-10-3
- Cycle 7: 3-7-14-9-0-3
- Cycle 8: 3-5-11-8-10-3
- Cycle 9: 3-5-6-13-2-3
- Cycle 10: 10-8-11-7-3-10
- Cycle 11: 10-8-9-0-3-10
- Cycle 12: 11-7-3-5-11
- Cycle 13: 11-9-0-3-11
- Cycle 14: 4-12-0-10-4

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <1, (8, 2), 13>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <1, (8, 7), 3>
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has no chords.
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <3, (11, 8), 10>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <3, (14, 9), 7>
- Cycle 8 has a chord: <3, (11, 8), 10>
- Cycle 9 has a chord: <3, (13, 2), 6>
- Cycle 10 has a chord: <10, (11, 8), 3>
- Cycle 11 has a chord: <10, (9, 0), 8>
- Cycle 12 has no chords.
- Cycle 13 has no chords.
- Cycle 14 has no chords.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
- Total chordal 4-cycles found = [6]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (8, 2), 13>
2. <1, (8, 7), 3>
3. <3, (11, 8), 10>
4. <3, (14, 9), 7>
5. <3, (13, 2), 6>
6. <10, (9, 0), 8>
