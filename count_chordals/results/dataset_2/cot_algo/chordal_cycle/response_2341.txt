Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 23) (22, 11) (22, 10) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 10) (23, 3) (23, 6) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 15) (18, 29) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 13) (21, 12) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 19) (3, 23) (3, 21) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 15) (26, 8) (14, 28) (14, 26) (14, 20) (12, 21) (16, 27) (16, 15) (7, 28) (29, 18) (29, 13) (13, 21) (13, 29) (13, 20) (13, 1) (15, 18) (15, 26) (15, 16) (15, 17) (0, 2) (0, 24) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 19) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 24) (9, 4) (9, 11) (6, 23) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 27) (19, 28) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 20) (27, 16) (27, 6) (27, 17) (25, 22) (25, 8) (24, 0) (24, 4) (10, 22) (10, 23) (10, 8) (8, 26) (8, 25) (8, 10) (11, 22) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 20) (20, 14) (20, 13) (20, 19) (20, 11) (17, 15) (17, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 22 - 23 - 3 - 21 - 22
        - Cycle 2: 1 - 2 - 18 - 15 - 1
        - Cycle 3: 1 - 19 - 4 - 24 - 1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (22, 3)
        - Cycle 2 has no chords
        - Cycle 3 has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
        <1, (22, 3), 21, 23, 22>
