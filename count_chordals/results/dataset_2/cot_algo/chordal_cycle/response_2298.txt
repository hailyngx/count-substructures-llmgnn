Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 20) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 25) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 24) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 27) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 27) (17, 21) (1, 26) (1, 19) (3, 28) (20, 11) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 22) (25, 11) (25, 16) (25, 20) (25, 23) (13, 11) (13, 4) (22, 20) (12, 5) (12, 21) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 10) (27, 19) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 15) (29, 17) (29, 4) (29, 18) (19, 1) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 4) (19, 6) (24, 9) (24, 26) (10, 27) (10, 7) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 18) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 23) (28, 3) (28, 18) (21, 17) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 23) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 6) (7, 18) (4, 13) (4, 29) (4, 19) (4, 23) (8, 20) (8, 21) (23, 25) (23, 0) (23, 21) (23, 4) (18, 29) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 25, 20, 11) with edges (11, 16), (16, 25), (25, 20), (20, 11)
- Cycle 2: (17, 9, 24, 26, 1, 19, 27, 14, 17) with edges (17, 9), (9, 24), (24, 26), (26, 1), (1, 19), (19, 27), (27, 14), (14, 17)
- Cycle 3: (17, 29, 4, 19, 27, 17) with edges (17, 29), (29, 4), (4, 19), (19, 27), (27, 17)
- Cycle 4: (0, 16, 25, 23, 0) with edges (0, 16), (16, 25), (25, 23), (23, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 15, 26, 1, 19, 4, 23, 0) with edges (0, 15), (15, 26), (26, 1), (1, 19), (19, 4), (4, 23), (23, 0)
- Cycle 6: (21, 17, 29, 18, 15, 26, 24, 9, 17, 21) with edges (21, 17), (17, 29), (29, 18), (18, 15), (15, 26), (26, 24), (24, 9), (9, 17), (17, 21)
- Cycle 7: (23, 4, 13, 11, 25, 23) with edges (23, 4), (4, 13), (13, 11), (11, 25), (25, 23)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: Chord <16, 20> (11, 25 can also be considered as a chord)
- Cycle 2: Chord <24, 14>
- Cycle 3: Chord <29, 19>
- Cycle 4: Chord <16, 23>
- Cycle 5: Chord <15, 19>
- Cycle 6: Chord <17, 26>
- Cycle 7: Chord <4, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
