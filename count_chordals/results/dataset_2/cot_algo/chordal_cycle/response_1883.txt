Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 13) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 14) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 23) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 7) (8, 5) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 24) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (21, 12) (21, 5) (21, 29) (22, 23) (22, 4) (23, 15) (23, 27) (23, 22) (4, 22) (4, 26) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 16) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 11) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 25) (26, 6) (26, 12) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 18) (20, 29) (20, 11) (29, 1) (29, 21) (29, 20) (6, 26) (18, 9) (18, 28) (18, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 24) (16, 2) (16, 10) (24, 15) (24, 13) (24, 16) (11, 17) (11, 20) (11, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 21) (5, 17) (0, 17) (0, 28) (0, 18) (0, 11) (14, 15) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 26) (12, 10) (12, 25) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 12) (25, 26) (25, 12) (2, 7) (2, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 3 - 1 - 7 - 2 - 3
- Cycle 2: 15 - 27 - 23 - 22 - 15
- Cycle 3: 4 - 22 - 23 - 15 - 4
- Cycle 4: 4 - 22 - 23 - 27 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 7, 2, 3> has a chord: (1, 2)
- <15, 23, 27, 22> has a chord: (23, 27)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
