Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 2, 5, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 9, 8, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 6, 2, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 9, 8, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 3, 0, 7, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 1, 5, 9, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 1, 3, 8, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 0, 3, 8, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 5, 6, 8, 2)
- Cycle 11: (3, 1, 5, 4, 3)
- Cycle 12: (3, 1, 2, 6, 3)
- Cycle 13: (3, 1, 2, 0, 3)
- Cycle 14: (3, 9, 8, 7, 3)
- Cycle 15: (5, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 16: (5, 1, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 17: (5, 2, 6, 5)
- Cycle 18: (6, 2, 1, 5, 6)
- Cycle 19: (6, 2, 0, 3, 6)
- Cycle 20: (6, 5, 1, 3, 6)
- Cycle 21: (6, 8, 3, 0, 6)
- Cycle 22: (8, 2, 1, 3, 8)
- Cycle 23: (8, 2, 0, 3, 8)
- Cycle 24: (8, 6, 5, 2, 8)
- Cycle 25: (9, 5, 1, 3, 9)
- Cycle 26: (9, 5, 6, 9)
- Cycle 27: (9, 3, 1, 5, 9)
- Cycle 28: (0, 3, 1, 2, 0)
- Cycle 29: (0, 2, 1, 3, 0)
- Cycle 30: (0, 3, 8, 7, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Only Cycle 18: (6, 2, 1, 5, 6) has exactly one chord (2, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<6, (2, 5), 1>
