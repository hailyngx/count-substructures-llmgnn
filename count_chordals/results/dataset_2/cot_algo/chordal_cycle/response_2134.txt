Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (5, 3, 1, 14)
- (3, 11, 2, 14)
- (3, 4, 11, 2)
- (3, 0, 10, 13)
- (11, 4, 13, 14)
- (3, 4, 12, 2)
- (3, 11, 12, 2)
- (3, 5, 7, 9)
- (5, 7, 8, 13)
- (0, 3, 4, 13)
- (0, 3, 11, 10)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 3, 1, 14> has one chord (3, 14), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <3, 11, 2, 14> has one chord (11, 2), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <3, 4, 11, 2> has one chord (4, 11), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <3, 0, 10, 13> has one chord (0, 10), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <11, 4, 13, 14> has one chord (4, 14), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <3, 4, 12, 2> has one chord (4, 12), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <3, 11, 12, 2> has one chord (11, 12), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <3, 5, 7, 9> has one chord (5, 7), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <5, 7, 8, 13> has one chord (7, 8), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <0, 3, 4, 13> has one chord (3, 4), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <0, 3, 11, 10> has one chord (3, 11), making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [11].
