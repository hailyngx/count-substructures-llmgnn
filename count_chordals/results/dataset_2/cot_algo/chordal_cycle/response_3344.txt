Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 18) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 17) (9, 6) (9, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (18, 14) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 10) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 10) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 2) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (19, 11) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 19) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 11-16-13-2-11
- Cycle 2: 11-16-13-15-11
- Cycle 3: 11-16-13-1-11
- Cycle 4: 11-16-13-1-12-11
- Cycle 5: 11-16-13-15-14-18-11
- Cycle 6: 11-16-13-2-7-13-11
- Cycle 7: 11-16-13-1-9-17-11
- Cycle 8: 11-19-12-1-11

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 11-13 (chord)
- Cycle 2: 16-15 (chord)
- Cycle 3: 13-1 (chord)
- Cycle 4: 13-12 (chord)
- Cycle 5: 13-18 (chord)
- Cycle 6: 13-7 (chord)
- Cycle 7: 13-17 (chord)
- Cycle 8: 12-1 (chord)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<11, 13, 16, 15>
<11, 13, 16, 18>
<11, 13, 16, 7>
<11, 13, 16, 17>
<11, 13, 16, 18>
<11, 12, 13, 1>
<11, 19, 12, 1>
<11, 16, 13, 2>
