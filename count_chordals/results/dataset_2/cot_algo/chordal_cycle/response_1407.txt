Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - (1, 4, 2, 5, 1)
        - (1, 5, 7, 3, 1)
        - (1, 7, 9, 3, 1)
        - (1, 9, 0, 2, 1)
        - (3, 7, 9, 1, 3)
        - (3, 8, 5, 7, 3)
        - (5, 7, 9, 1, 5)
        - (5, 8, 6, 0, 5)
        - (6, 8, 5, 7, 6)
        - (9, 1, 7, 5, 9)
        - (9, 2, 0, 6, 9)
        - (0, 2, 5, 8, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - <1, (2, 5), 4>
        - <1, (3, 7), 5>
        - <1, (7, 9), 3>
        - <1, (0, 2), 9>
        - <3, (1, 9), 7>
        - <3, (5, 8), 7>
        - <5, (1, 9), 7>
        - <5, (6, 8), 7>
        - <6, (5, 7), 8>
        - <9, (1, 7), 5>
        - <9, (0, 6), 2>
        - <0, (2, 5), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are [12] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
