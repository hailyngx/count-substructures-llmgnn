Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 10) (22, 13) (22, 21) (15, 29) (15, 28) (27, 6) (9, 26) (9, 14) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 3) (26, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (21, 22) (21, 1) (21, 17) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 11) (29, 15) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 10) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 17) (4, 19) (4, 28) (4, 11) (8, 26) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 28) (20, 11) (17, 21) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 5) (3, 26) (3, 24) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 20) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 23) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 23) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 25) (5, 26) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 24) (18, 10) (18, 25) (28, 15) (28, 4) (28, 8) (28, 12) (6, 27) (6, 14) (6, 25) (6, 12) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 23) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 5) (10, 13) (10, 29) (10, 18) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 25) (25, 16) (25, 18) (25, 6) (25, 12) (23, 0) (23, 19) (23, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (22, 13, 10, 29, 15, 28, 4, 19)
- Cycle 2: (22, 21, 17, 1, 29, 15, 28, 12)
- Cycle 3: (15, 29, 10, 18, 25, 16, 13, 22)
- Cycle 4: (16, 25, 18, 10, 29, 1, 21, 22)
- Cycle 5: (13, 10, 29, 15, 28, 12, 25, 16)
- Cycle 6: (9, 19, 4, 28, 12, 25, 6, 27)
- Cycle 7: (9, 19, 23, 0, 24, 5, 7, 17)
- Cycle 8: (2, 16, 25, 18, 10, 13, 22, 21)
- Cycle 9: (7, 0, 23, 19, 4, 28, 15, 29)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:

- Cycle 1: <(22, 13)>
- Cycle 2: <(17, 21)>
- Cycle 3: <>
- Cycle 4: <>
- Cycle 5: <>
- Cycle 6: <>
- Cycle 7: <(0, 19)>
- Cycle 8: <>
- Cycle 9: <(0, 29)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<22, 13, 10, 29>
<22, 21, 17, 1>
<0, 23, 19, 4>
<7, 17, 5, 24>
