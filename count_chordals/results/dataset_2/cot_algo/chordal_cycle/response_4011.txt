Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 20) (3, 11) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 26) (25, 21) (20, 16) (20, 17) (20, 8) (8, 20) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 4) (13, 29) (7, 3) (7, 21) (7, 17) (21, 25) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 14) (18, 3) (18, 22) (18, 1) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 2) (6, 28) (6, 2) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 9) (9, 22) (9, 28) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 2) (24, 29) (26, 25) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 15) (17, 20) (17, 8) (17, 7) (17, 27) (0, 3) (4, 13) (4, 15) (4, 2) (12, 14) (5, 15) (5, 10) (5, 27) (10, 8) (10, 5) (14, 11) (14, 21) (14, 12) (2, 22) (2, 6) (2, 24) (2, 4) (2, 27) (1, 18) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 24) (15, 26) (15, 4) (15, 5) (19, 27) (19, 23) (27, 24) (27, 17) (27, 5) (27, 2) (27, 19) (23, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
1. Cycle <3, 11, 16, 20>
2. Cycle <3, 11, 14, 21>
3. Cycle <3, 7, 21, 13>
4. Cycle <4, 13, 21, 14>
5. Cycle <4, 13, 8, 10>
6. Cycle <5, 10, 8, 17>
7. Cycle <5, 15, 26, 25>
8. Cycle <5, 27, 17, 20>
9. Cycle <6, 28, 26, 25>
10. Cycle <9, 22, 18, 3>
11. Cycle <9, 28, 26, 15>
12. Cycle <13, 4, 2, 22>
13. Cycle <13, 8, 17, 7>
14. Cycle <13, 29, 24, 2>
15. Cycle <14, 11, 3, 18>
16. Cycle <17, 7, 21, 25>
17. Cycle <17, 8, 13, 29>
18. Cycle <17, 27, 24, 29>
19. Cycle <19, 23, 27, 24>
20. Cycle <20, 16, 11, 3>
21. Cycle <21, 13, 8, 20>
22. Cycle <21, 14, 12, 11>
23. Cycle <22, 18, 3, 11>
24. Cycle <24, 26, 15, 4>
25. Cycle <27, 17, 8, 13>
26. Cycle <27, 19, 23, 24>
27. Cycle <28, 26, 15, 5>
28. Cycle <29, 8, 20, 17>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
1. Chordal 4-cycle found: < 3, 11, 16, 20 > having chord (16, 20)
2. Chordal 4-cycle found: < 3, 11, 14, 21 > having chord (11, 14)
3. Chordal 4-cycle found: < 5, 10, 8, 17 > having chord (10, 17)
4. Chordal 4-cycle found: < 5, 15, 26, 25 > having chord (15, 25)
5. Chordal 4-cycle found: < 9, 22, 18, 3 > having chord (22, 3)
6. Chordal 4-cycle found: < 13, 8, 17, 7 > having chord (8, 7)
7. Chordal 4-cycle found: < 17, 7, 21, 25 > having chord (7, 21)
8. Chordal 4-cycle found: < 17, 8, 13, 29 > having chord (8, 13)
9. Chordal 4-cycle found: < 27, 17, 8, 13 > having chord (17, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 19 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
