Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- <0, 5, 1, 4, 0>
- <0, 5, 10, 4, 0>
- <0, 3, 9, 4, 0>
- <0, 3, 13, 7, 0>
- <1, 5, 10, 11, 1>
- <1, 5, 8, 12, 1>
- <2, 9, 4, 10, 2>
- <2, 9, 3, 13, 2>
- <2, 6, 8, 12, 2>
- <3, 9, 4, 10, 3>
- <4, 9, 3, 13, 4>
- <5, 13, 3, 0, 5>
- <6, 8, 12, 14, 6>
  
Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (5, 14), 8, 12, (1, 4)>
- <2, (6, 11), 7, 13, (2, 9)>
- <4, (10, 7), 13, 3, (4, 9)>
- <5, (1, 10), 4, 0, (5, 13)>

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
- <1, (5, 14), 8, 12, (1, 4)>
- <2, (6, 11), 7, 13, (2, 9)>
- <4, (10, 7), 13, 3, (4, 9)>
- <5, (1, 10), 4, 0, (5, 13)>
