Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 16) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 15) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 13) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 1) (19, 17) (19, 15) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 8) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 10) (13, 15) (11, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 17, 1, 16, 12, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 14, 17, 19, 15, 9, 12>
- Cycle 3: <0, 14, 17, 5, 6, 3, 8>
- Cycle 4: <1, 17, 19, 15, 9, 12, 3>
- Cycle 5: <1, 17, 19, 15, 13, 10, 0>
- Cycle 6: <2, 18, 13, 14, 17, 5, 11>
- Cycle 7: <2, 18, 13, 15, 9, 12, 16>
- Cycle 8: <3, 12, 16, 2, 18, 13, 10>
- Cycle 9: <4, 0, 14, 17, 19, 15, 13>
- Cycle 10: <5, 17, 19, 15, 13, 18, 4>
- Cycle 11: <6, 5, 17, 14, 13, 15, 9>
- Cycle 12: <8, 1, 17, 19, 15, 13, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3: <0, 14, 17, 5, 6, 3, 8> has one chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 10: <5, 17, 19, 15, 13, 18, 4> has one chord: (15, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are [10] chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
