Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 10) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 9) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the given graph, but we will focus on the 4-cycles:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-6-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-6-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-13-1-0
- Cycle 4: 0-8-2-5-0
- Cycle 5: 0-8-2-7-0
- Cycle 6: 1-13-9-4-1
- Cycle 7: 2-5-6-7-2
- Cycle 8: 2-5-6-11-2
- Cycle 9: 2-5-1-13-2
- Cycle 10: 3-6-7-11-3
- Cycle 11: 3-6-7-10-3
- Cycle 12: 3-13-1-5-3
- Cycle 13: 4-9-13-1-4
- Cycle 14: 4-9-13-3-4
- Cycle 15: 7-11-6-5-7
- Cycle 16: 8-4-9-13-8
- Cycle 17: 8-4-9-12-8
- Cycle 18: 8-0-3-6-8
- Cycle 19: 9-10-7-11-9
- Cycle 20: 9-10-7-6-9
- Cycle 21: 10-7-11-12-10
- Cycle 22: 10-7-11-6-10
- Cycle 23: 12-10-7-11-12
- Cycle 24: 12-14-3-0-12
- Cycle 25: 12-14-3-13-12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

After checking all cycles, we find that the only chordal 4-cycle in the graph is:

<2, (8, 14), 0, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
