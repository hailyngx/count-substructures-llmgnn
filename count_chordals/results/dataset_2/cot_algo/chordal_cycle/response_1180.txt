- Cycle 3: (4, 18, 28, 21, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 25, 21, 15, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 4, 18, 28, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 23, 17, 0, 7)
- Cycle 7: (14, 0, 17, 23, 14)
- Cycle 8: (14, 2, 11, 1, 14)
- Cycle 9: (14, 2, 22, 2, 14)
- Cycle 10: (14, 25, 9, 25, 14)
- Cycle 11: (15, 12, 27, 26, 15)
- Cycle 12: (15, 21, 25, 9, 15)
- Cycle 13: (15, 21, 28, 20, 15)
- Cycle 14: (15, 24, 20, 7, 15)
- Cycle 15: (16, 3, 24, 20, 16)
- Cycle 16: (16, 18, 4, 7, 16)
- Cycle 17: (16, 18, 28, 21, 16)
- Cycle 18: (17, 0, 14, 25, 17)
- Cycle 19: (19, 11, 1, 13, 19)
- Cycle 20: (19, 13, 10, 21, 19)
- Cycle 21: (19, 29, 5, 23, 19)
- Cycle 22: (20, 7, 4, 18, 20)
- Cycle 23: (20, 24, 3, 16, 20)
- Cycle 24: (21, 15, 27, 12, 21)
- Cycle 25: (21, 25, 14, 0, 21)
- Cycle 26: (22, 2, 14, 25, 22)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 8: Chord <2, 11>
- Cycle 10: Chord <9, 25>
- Cycle 27: Chord <11, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<14, 25, 21, 15>
<17, 23, 1, 14>
<11, 1, 13, 19>
