Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:  
- Cycle 1: 5-9-12-7-5  
- Cycle 2: 5-9-12-4-5  
- Cycle 3: 5-9-8-12-5  
- Cycle 4: 5-8-12-9-5  
- Cycle 5: 5-8-12-4-5  
- Cycle 6: 5-8-10-9-5  
- Cycle 7: 5-8-10-14-5  
- Cycle 8: 5-8-11-9-5  
- Cycle 9: 5-8-11-4-5  
- Cycle 10: 5-1-11-9-5  
- Cycle 11: 5-1-11-4-5  
- Cycle 12: 5-1-13-11-5  
- Cycle 13: 5-1-13-2-5  
- Cycle 14: 5-1-14-6-5  
- Cycle 15: 5-1-14-10-5  

Step 2:  
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:  
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 9, 12, 7> with chord (12, 9)  
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 8, 12, 4> with chord (12, 8)  
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 8, 10, 9> with chord (8, 10)  
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 8, 11, 9> with chord (8, 11)  
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 1, 11, 9> with chord (1, 11)  
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 1, 13, 11> with chord (1, 13)  

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [6]

Therefore, the final count of the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
