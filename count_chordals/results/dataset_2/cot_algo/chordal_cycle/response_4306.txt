        - Cycle 3: (6, 9, 4, 15, 10, 6)
        - Cycle 4: (6, 4, 17, 18, 15, 10, 6)
        - Cycle 5: (6, 4, 15, 10, 16, 14, 6)
        - Cycle 6: (6, 4, 15, 19, 12, 9, 4)

        - Cycle 16: (9, 12, 19, 15, 10, 6, 14, 8, 9)
        - Cycle 17: (9, 12, 19, 15, 18, 17, 4, 9)
        - Cycle 18: (9, 12, 2, 13, 16, 10, 6, 4, 9)
        - Cycle 19: (9, 12, 2, 5, 8, 14, 16, 10, 9)
        - Cycle 20: (9, 12, 18, 17, 4, 15, 19, 15, 9)
        - Cycle 21: (10, 15, 19, 12, 2, 13, 16, 10)
        - Cycle 22: (10, 15, 19, 12, 18, 17, 4, 15, 10)
        - Cycle 23: (10, 15, 18, 17, 4, 9, 12, 19, 10)
        - Cycle 24: (13, 16, 10, 15, 19, 12, 2, 5, 13)
        - Cycle 25: (13, 16, 14, 8, 5, 2, 12, 19, 13)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has chord (9, 7)
        - Cycle 2 has chord (18, 12)
        - Cycle 3 has chord (9, 4)
        - Cycle 4 has chord (10, 15)
        - Cycle 5 has chord (4, 16)
        - Cycle 6 has chord (15, 12)
        - Cycle 7 has chord (15, 18)
        - Cycle 8 has chord (15, 18)
        - Cycle 9 has chord (4, 9)
        - Cycle 10 has chord (14, 8)
        - Cycle 11 has chord (14, 16)
        - Cycle 12 has chord (1, 2)
        - Cycle 13 has chord (1, 16)
        - Cycle 14 has chord (14, 16)
        - Cycle 15 has chord (1, 16)
        - Cycle 16 has chord (19, 10)
        - Cycle 17 has chord (19, 15)
        - Cycle 18 has chord (12, 2)
        - Cycle 19 has chord (19, 15)
        - Cycle 20 has chord (19, 15)
        - Cycle 21 has chord (15, 12)
        - Cycle 22 has chord (15, 9)
        - Cycle 23 has chord (15, 4)
        - Cycle 24 has chord (16, 5)
        - Cycle 25 has chord (16, 8)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        As per the above analysis, there are 25 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
        
Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [25].
