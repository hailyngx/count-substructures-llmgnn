Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 0) (16, 15) (16, 2) (15, 16) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 7) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 7) (2, 16) (2, 20) (2, 3) (29, 28) (29, 19) (3, 2) (3, 25) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 24) (20, 2) (20, 14) (5, 24) (6, 15) (6, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (26, 19) (26, 22) (26, 17) (28, 11) (28, 29) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 23) (19, 29) (19, 26) (19, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 23) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 21) (22, 26) (22, 10) (22, 12) (0, 11) (0, 28) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 20) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (10, 6) (10, 22) (21, 18) (8, 28) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 12) (24, 11) (24, 25) (24, 5) (17, 26) (17, 12) (17, 23) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 4) (23, 17) (23, 13) (7, 15) (7, 27) (7, 18) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 9) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 14 - 20 - 2 - 16 - 15 - 23 - 4 - 3
- Cycle 2: 0 - 14 - 20 - 2 - 16 - 15 - 27 - 7 - 18 - 4
- Cycle 3: 1 - 13 - 14 - 0 - 8 - 12 - 22 - 10 - 6 - 15
- Cycle 4: 9 - 1 - 13 - 23 - 17 - 12 - 8 - 0 - 11 - 24
- Cycle 5: 9 - 19 - 26 - 22 - 12 - 17 - 23 - 15 - 6 - 10
- Cycle 6: 11 - 28 - 29 - 19 - 9 - 1 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 20
- Cycle 7: 11 - 28 - 29 - 19 - 9 - 1 - 4 - 23 - 15 - 16
- Cycle 8: 11 - 0 - 14 - 20 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 18 - 7 - 27
- Cycle 9: 11 - 0 - 14 - 13 - 1 - 4 - 23 - 17 - 26 - 22

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord: (0, 2)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (14, 4)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (14, 6)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (1, 24)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (9, 10)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (28, 4)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (2, 15)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (0, 22)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, (0, 2), 14, 20, 16>
- <1, (14, 6), 13, 8, 12>
- <9, (9, 10), 19, 26, 17>
- <4, (1, 24), 23, 12, 8>
- <11, (28, 4), 29, 19, 9>
- <11, (2, 15), 28, 0, 14>
- <0, (0, 22), 14, 20, 2>
