Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 4-7-0-6-4
- Cycle 2: 4-9-8-1-4
- Cycle 3: 4-5-1-6-4
- Cycle 4: 7-0-6-1-7
- Cycle 5: 7-8-1-5-7
- Cycle 6: 6-0-4-9-6
- Cycle 7: 6-1-8-9-6
- Cycle 8: 6-5-3-1-6
- Cycle 9: 9-8-7-0-9
- Cycle 10: 9-3-2-1-9
- Cycle 11: 1-5-8-9-1
- Cycle 12: 1-3-2-5-1
- Cycle 13: 3-9-4-5-3
- Cycle 14: 8-4-0-2-8
- Cycle 15: 5-4-9-3-5
- Cycle 16: 0-7-8-2-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <4, (7, 1), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (9, 1), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (5, 1), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, (0, 1), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <7, (8, 5), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (0, 4), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, (1, 8), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, (5, 3), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (8, 7), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <9, (3, 2), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <1, (5, 8), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <1, (3, 2), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <3, (9, 4), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <8, (4, 0), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <5, (4, 9), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <0, (7, 8), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [16].
