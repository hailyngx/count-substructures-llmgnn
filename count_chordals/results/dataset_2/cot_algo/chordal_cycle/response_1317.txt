Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1:
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 9-5-4-14-9
- Cycle 2: 9-6-7-1-9
- Cycle 3: 2-9-1-6-2
- Cycle 4: 2-12-0-6-2
- Cycle 5: 2-12-0-13-11-2
- Cycle 6: 0-6-1-7-0
- Cycle 7: 0-6-1-11-8-0
- Cycle 8: 0-12-2-13-0
- Cycle 9: 6-1-7-3-6
- Cycle 10: 1-7-3-4-14-1
- Cycle 11: 1-7-6-0-12-1
- Cycle 12: 1-11-13-0-6-1
- Cycle 13: 6-7-0-12-10-6
- Cycle 14: 6-7-3-10-8-6
- Cycle 15: 6-7-1-11-8-6

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, 9, 5, 4> with chord (1, 9)
<6, 7, 1, 9> with chord (6, 1)
<2, 12, 0, 6> with chord (2, 12)
<0, 6, 1, 7> with chord (0, 1)
<1, 7, 6, 0> with chord (1, 6)

Step 3:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
