Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 11) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 3) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (4, 8, 12, 1, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (7, 12, 6, 5, 7)
        - Cycle 3: (10, 4, 1, 5, 10)
        - Cycle 4: (11, 7, 12, 10, 11)
        - Cycle 5: (0, 5, 1, 12, 6, 0)
        - Cycle 6: (14, 0, 5, 2, 13, 14)
        - Cycle 7: (9, 12, 7, 11, 9)
        - Cycle 8: (13, 6, 12, 9, 14, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord (8, 1) which creates a chordal 4-cycle <8, (8, 1), 12, 4>.
        - Cycle 2 has a chord (12, 7) which creates a chordal 4-cycle <12, (12, 7), 6, 5>.
        - Cycle 5 has a chord (5, 12) which creates a chordal 4-cycle <5, (5, 12), 6, 0>.
        - Cycle 6 has a chord (5, 14) which creates a chordal 4-cycle <5, (5, 14), 2, 13>.
        - Cycle 8 has a chord (6, 9) which creates a chordal 4-cycle <6, (6, 9), 12, 13>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [5].
