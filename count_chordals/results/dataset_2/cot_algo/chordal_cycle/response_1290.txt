Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-6-0-4
- Cycle 2: 4-9-3-6-4
- Cycle 3: 4-5-3-9-4
- Cycle 4: 4-2-3-8-4
- Cycle 5: 7-6-3-9-7
- Cycle 6: 7-5-3-2-7
- Cycle 7: 1-3-9-6-1
- Cycle 8: 1-2-3-5-1
- Cycle 9: 3-5-2-8-3

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (6-4) <4, (6, 4)>
- Cycle 2 has one chord (9-3) <2, (3, 9)>
- Cycle 3 has one chord (9-5) <3, (5, 9)>
- Cycle 4 has one chord (3-8) <5, (3, 8)>
- Cycle 5 has one chord (3-9) <6, (3, 9)>
- Cycle 6 has one chord (3-5) <7, (3, 5)>
- Cycle 7 has one chord (3-6) <8, (3, 6)>
- Cycle 8 has one chord (3-2) <9, (2, 3)>
- Cycle 9 has one chord (5-8) <10, (5, 8)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
The only chordless cycle found is Cycle 1.

Therefore, the final answer is [1]. The unique chordal 4-cycle is <4, 7, 6, 0>.
