Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 1) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 19) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 14) (15, 9) (15, 7) (15, 12) (12, 8) (12, 15) (12, 0) (7, 16) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 19) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 9-5-6-10-9
- Cycle 2: 9-5-6-10-17-1-13-9
- Cycle 3: 9-5-6-10-17-7-14-19-18-4-2-9
- Cycle 4: 9-5-6-10-17-7-15-12-0-8-18-4-2-9

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 0 chord.
- Cycle 2 has 0 chord.
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: 6-10.
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: 6-10.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 2 chordless cycles found, so the final answer is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (6, 10), 13, 17>
- <2, (6, 10), 4, 18>
