Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 23) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 2) (26, 28) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 24) (2, 26) (2, 3) (2, 20) (2, 14) (29, 19) (29, 16) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 12) (20, 2) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 8) (0, 16) (8, 25) (8, 23) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 1) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 8) (23, 6) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 12) (17, 6) (17, 12) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 15) (24, 11) (24, 13) (5, 13) (13, 24) (13, 5) (13, 11) (21, 18) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 28) (1, 10) (7, 3) (7, 25) (7, 11) (19, 29) (19, 8) (16, 29) (16, 0) (12, 22) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 10) (11, 9) (11, 24) (11, 13) (11, 7) (6, 8) (6, 23) (6, 17) (10, 1) (10, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 20) (28, 26) (28, 22) (28, 20) (28, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 15, 3, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 15, 24, 13, 11, 7, 25, 8, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 14, 20, 25, 7, 3, 2)
- Cycle 4: (4, 18, 22, 12, 17, 6, 23, 8, 25, 7, 25, 20, 2, 3, 15, 1, 8, 19, 29, 16, 0, 16, 29, 19, 8, 23, 9, 11, 13, 24, 15, 3, 7, 11, 13, 5, 24, 26, 2, 14, 20, 28, 26, 24, 15, 1, 10, 12, 4)
- Cycle 5: (8, 6, 17, 12, 22, 18, 4, 12, 10, 1, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, 15, 3, 2, 1> has 0 chords
- <1, 15, 24, 13, 11, 7, 25, 8, 1> has 0 chords
- <2, 14, 20, 25, 7, 3, 2> has 0 chords
- <4, 18, 22, 12, 17, 6, 23, 8, 25, 7, 25, 20, 2, 3, 15, 1, 8, 19, 29, 16, 0, 16, 29, 19, 8, 23, 9, 11, 13, 24, 15, 3, 7, 11, 13, 5, 24, 26, 2, 14, 20, 28, 26, 24, 15, 1, 10, 12, 4> has 0 chords
- <8, 6, 17, 12, 22, 18, 4, 12, 10, 1, 8> has 1 chord: (4, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 4 chordless 4-cycles, so the final answer is [4].
