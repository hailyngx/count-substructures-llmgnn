Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 6) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 15) (10, 15) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 14) (17, 16) (17, 13) (18, 8) (19, 7) (19, 3) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (14, 8) (14, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-7-4-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-7-1-3-0
- Cycle 3: 5-3-1-7-5
- Cycle 4: 5-13-8-4-5
- Cycle 5: 4-8-13-5-4
- Cycle 6: 15-0-7-19-15
- Cycle 7: 15-0-13-8-15

Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, Cycle 4 (5-13-8-4-5) and Cycle 5 (4-8-13-5-4) have exactly one chord 8-5 and 13-4 respectively.

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <5, 13, 8, 4, 5>
- <4, 8, 13, 5, 4>
