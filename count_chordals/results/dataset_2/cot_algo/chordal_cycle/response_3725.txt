Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (17, 14) (17, 16) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 9) (22, 5) (22, 24) (23, 2) (23, 3) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (6, 25) (6, 8) (6, 13) (28, 21) (19, 26) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 25) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 8) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 4) (15, 12) (15, 1) (8, 6) (8, 26) (8, 9) (8, 29) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 19) (10, 27) (25, 6) (25, 26) (25, 4) (27, 14) (27, 10) (11, 26) (11, 0) (0, 11) (3, 23) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 18) (16, 20) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 4) (13, 21) (13, 6) (13, 29) (2, 23) (2, 1) (20, 26) (20, 16) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 4) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 5) (4, 1) (4, 25) (4, 24) (4, 29) (4, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (7, 21, 10, 27, 14)
- Cycle 2: (7, 21, 13, 6, 25)
- Cycle 3: (7, 12, 15, 1, 16)
- Cycle 4: (7, 18, 16, 24, 22)
- Cycle 5: (7, 9, 3, 23, 2)
- Cycle 6: (21, 28, 19, 10, 27)
- Cycle 7: (21, 10, 19, 26, 25)
- Cycle 8: (21, 13, 6, 8, 26)
- Cycle 9: (12, 15, 1, 16, 17)
- Cycle 10: (12, 7, 21, 10, 19)
- Cycle 11: (12, 18, 16, 24, 4)
- Cycle 12: (6, 25, 26, 8, 9)
- Cycle 13: (6, 13, 21, 7, 18)
- Cycle 14: (28, 21, 7, 12, 15)
- Cycle 15: (19, 26, 8, 9, 3)
- Cycle 16: (1, 15, 12, 7, 21)
- Cycle 17: (1, 16, 18, 5, 22)
- Cycle 18: (8, 26, 25, 4, 29)
- Cycle 19: (9, 3, 23, 2, 1)
- Cycle 20: (10, 27, 14, 17, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <7, (21, 10), 27>
- <7, (21, 13), 6>
- <12, (15, 1), 16>
- <7, (18, 16), 24>
- <7, (9, 3), 23>
- <21, (10, 19), 27>
- <21, (13, 6), 8>
- <12, (15, 1), 16>
- <16, (18, 5), 22>
- <8, (26, 25), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph, so the final count is [10].
