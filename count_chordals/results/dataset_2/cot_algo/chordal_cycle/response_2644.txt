Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (10, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 12) (3, 18) (1, 11) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 17) (15, 4) (8, 9) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 5) (17, 15) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 15) (12, 11) (12, 3) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 19) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (14, 19) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 14) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-11-16-7-15-1
- Cycle 2: 4-10-4
- Cycle 3: 5-6-4-10-5
- Cycle 4: 5-6-7-15-5
- Cycle 5: 5-6-7-16-11-1-15-5
- Cycle 6: 5-9-7-15-5
- Cycle 7: 5-9-7-16-11-1-15-5
- Cycle 8: 6-7-15-5-6
- Cycle 9: 7-9-5-6-7
- Cycle 10: 7-9-5-17-15-7
- Cycle 11: 7-9-8-9
- Cycle 12: 7-16-11-1-15-7
- Cycle 13: 13-6-7-15-13
- Cycle 14: 15-7-9-5-15
- Cycle 15: 18-16-7-15-18
- Cycle 16: 18-0-6-7-18
- Cycle 17: 18-3-12-11-1-15-18
- Cycle 18: 19-0-6-5-19
- Cycle 19: 19-0-6-7-19
- Cycle 20: 19-0-15-7-19

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle found:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5-6-7-15-5, (6, 15)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
