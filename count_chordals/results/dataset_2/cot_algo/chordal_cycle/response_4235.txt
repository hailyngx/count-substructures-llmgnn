Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        1. Cycle: (5, 9, 2, 4)
        2. Cycle: (5, 9, 8, 4)
        3. Cycle: (5, 9, 1, 3)
        4. Cycle: (5, 1, 3, 7)
        5. Cycle: (5, 1, 8, 4)
        6. Cycle: (5, 4, 2, 7)
        7. Cycle: (5, 4, 6, 0)
        8. Cycle: (5, 7, 3, 4)
        9. Cycle: (9, 8, 1, 5)
        10. Cycle: (9, 8, 0, 6)
        11. Cycle: (9, 2, 4, 6)
        12. Cycle: (9, 1, 3, 7)
        13. Cycle: (4, 6, 0, 8)
        14. Cycle: (4, 2, 7, 3)
        15. Cycle: (7, 3, 1, 5)
        16. Cycle: (7, 0, 6, 4)
        17. Cycle: (1, 8, 4, 5)
        18. Cycle: (3, 2, 4, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        Chordal 4-cycle(s):
        <5, 9, 2, 4, (4, 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
