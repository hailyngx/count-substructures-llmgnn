Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 2, 14, 4)
- Cycle 3: (6, 4, 8, 2, 6)
- Cycle 4: (13, 5, 0, 14, 13)
- Cycle 5: (12, 5, 0, 11, 12)
- Cycle 6: (11, 9, 3, 0, 11)
- Cycle 7: (3, 9, 11, 2, 3)
- Cycle 8: (1, 5, 9, 11, 1)
- Cycle 9: (10, 4, 8, 2, 10)
- Cycle 10: (2, 8, 4, 6, 2)
- Cycle 11: (14, 6, 4, 8, 14)
- Cycle 12: (0, 5, 13, 6, 0)
- Cycle 13: (9, 5, 13, 6, 9)
- Cycle 14: (12, 13, 3, 0, 12)
- Cycle 15: (11, 12, 2, 14, 11)
- Cycle 16: (14, 0, 3, 9, 14)
- Cycle 17: (2, 14, 1, 5, 2)
- Cycle 18: (10, 6, 13, 5, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Only Cycle 16 has exactly one chord - (14, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle in the graph, so the final count is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <16, (14, 9)>
