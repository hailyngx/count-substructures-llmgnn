Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 24) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 15) (11, 21) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 20) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 27) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 26) (8, 16) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 1) (23, 3) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 24) (15, 22) (15, 20) (20, 16) (20, 15) (20, 29) (26, 25) (26, 4) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 2) (17, 9) (17, 18) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 14) (14, 22) (14, 29) (14, 2) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 27) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 21) (19, 24) (19, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (2, 28) (2, 14) (2, 19) (4, 26) (0, 28) (0, 19) (0, 12) (21, 11) (21, 19) (12, 28) (12, 0) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 1) (5, 27) (27, 9) (27, 18) (27, 5) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 24) (1, 8) (1, 23) (1, 5) (1, 10) (24, 13) (24, 23) (24, 19) (24, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 2-14-22-15-20-16-7-3-25 (length 8)
- Cycle 2: 2-14-29-5-1-8-16-20-15 (length 8)
- Cycle 3: 2-19-21-11-21-19-24-23-3-7 (length 8)
- Cycle 4: 2-19-24-13-9-6-16-20-15 (length 8)
- Cycle 5: 2-19-24-10-8-23-3-7-16 (length 8)
- Cycle 6: 2-19-24-10-1-5-27-9-13 (length 8)
- Cycle 7: 2-28-0-19-24 (length 5)
- Cycle 8: 2-28-0-12-28 (length 4)
- Cycle 9: 2-28-0-19-2 (length 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <2, 14, 22, 15>
- <2, 14, 29, 5>
- <2, 19, 21, 11>
- <2, 19, 24, 13>
- <2, 19, 24, 10>
- <2, 19, 24, 13>
- <2, 28, 0, 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [7].
