Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 14) (4, 7) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 17) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (2, 12) (2, 14) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 0) (15, 4) (15, 18) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 0) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 0) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 3) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 3) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 1) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<0, 1, 13, 19>  
<0, 1, 7, 17>  
<0, 6, 14, 16>  
<3, 4, 7, 17>  
<3, 9, 14, 16>  
<4, 7, 17, 12>  
<6, 14, 9, 17>  
<8, 10, 17, 7>  
<8, 18, 15, 4>  
<9, 14, 2, 12>  
<9, 17, 7, 1>  
<11, 12, 17, 7>  
<11, 16, 14, 2>  
<13, 1, 7, 4>  
<13, 19, 6, 14>  
<15, 4, 7, 17>  
<16, 14, 6, 0>  
<16, 3, 9, 17>  
<16, 11, 12, 2>  
<18, 8, 1, 13>  

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 1, 13, 19> has chord (1, 13)
- Cycle <3, 4, 7, 17> has chord (4, 17)
- Cycle <4, 7, 17, 12> has chord (7, 12)
- Cycle <9, 14, 2, 12> has chord (14, 12)
- Cycle <11, 16, 14, 2> has chord (16, 14)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 1, 13, 19>
<3, 4, 7, 17>
<4, 7, 17, 12>
<9, 14, 2, 12>
<11, 16, 14, 2>
