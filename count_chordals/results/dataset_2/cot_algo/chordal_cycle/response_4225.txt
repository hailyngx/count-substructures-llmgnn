Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (11, 12) (11, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (1, 7, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 7, 5, 13, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 7, 12, 11, 4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 7, 12, 14, 10, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 7, 8, 10, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 13, 5, 7, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 13, 10, 14, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 13, 10, 8, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 13, 10, 4, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 14, 12, 7, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 14, 10, 8, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 14, 7, 5, 13, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 contains a chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 2 contains a chord (1, 13)
- Cycle 3 contains a chord (7, 11)
- Cycle 4 contains a chord (7, 14)
- Cycle 5 contains a chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 6 contains a chord (1, 13)
- Cycle 7 contains a chord (13, 10)
- Cycle 8 contains a chord (13, 10)
- Cycle 9 contains a chord (13, 4)
- Cycle 10 contains a chord (14, 7)
- Cycle 11 contains a chord (14, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [11]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (1, 5)>
<2, (1, 13)>
<3, (7, 11)>
<4, (7, 14)>
<5, (7, 8)>
<6, (13, 10)>
<7, (13, 4)>
<8, (14, 7)>
<9, (14, 10)>
