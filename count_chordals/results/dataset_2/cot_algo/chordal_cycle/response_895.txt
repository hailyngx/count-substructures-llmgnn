Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles with 4 or more nodes:
- Cycle 1: 5-4-1-6
- Cycle 2: 5-4-3-6
- Cycle 3: 9-7-6-1
- Cycle 4: 9-7-8-1
- Cycle 5: 9-2-1-6
- Cycle 6: 9-2-0-6
- Cycle 7: 4-3-8-1
- Cycle 8: 4-3-6-0
- Cycle 9: 7-8-3-6
- Cycle 10: 7-8-1-6
- Cycle 11: 8-1-2-5
- Cycle 12: 8-3-6-0
- Cycle 13: 1-4-3-6
- Cycle 14: 1-4-8-7
- Cycle 15: 6-7-9-2
- Cycle 16: 6-7-8-3
- Cycle 17: 0-6-7-9
- Cycle 18: 0-6-3-4
- Cycle 19: 2-5-4-1
- Cycle 20: 2-5-0-6

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (4, 1), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (4, 3), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, (7, 8), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (7, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (2, 0), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, (3, 8), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, (3, 6), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <7, (8, 3), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <8, (1, 2), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <1, (4, 3), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <1, (4, 8), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <6, (7, 9), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <0, (6, 7), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <2, (5, 4), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <2, (5, 0), 6>

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [15]
