Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 0) (26, 18) (26, 6) (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 29) (21, 15) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 20) (3, 16) (8, 5) (8, 27) (8, 22) (13, 7) (13, 6) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 23) (27, 8) (27, 12) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 18) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 24) (11, 15) (28, 17) (18, 26) (18, 7) (18, 23) (18, 5) (19, 23) (19, 22) (19, 15) (23, 12) (23, 18) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 20) (25, 23) (25, 5) (25, 16) (6, 26) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 16) (15, 21) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 24) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 25) (2, 10) (2, 24) (17, 0) (17, 28) (16, 3) (16, 25) (16, 22) (16, 4) (29, 21) (29, 4) (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 4) (20, 10) (10, 2) (10, 20) (4, 16) (4, 29) (4, 20) (24, 14) (24, 15) (24, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-21-29-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-21-15-24-14-0-9-3-1
- Cycle 3: 1-21-15-19-22-8-27-12-7-13-6-1
- Cycle 4: 1-21-15-19-22-16-25-5-1
- Cycle 5: 1-21-15-24-2-10-20-4-29-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (21, 29)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (8, 12)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (16, 22)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (2, 24)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (21, 29), 4)>
<1, (3, 9), 1)>
<1, (8, 12), 6)>
<1, (16, 22), 25)>
<1, (2, 24), 10)>
