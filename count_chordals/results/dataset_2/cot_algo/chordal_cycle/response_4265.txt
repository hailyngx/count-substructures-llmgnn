Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 19) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 13) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 10) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 17) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (5, 8) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 16) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 13) (11, 1) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 16) (14, 3) (16, 9) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 10) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 15) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 16) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 19) 

Response:
Step 1:
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph where every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 19 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 2: 17 - 9 - 8 - 5 - 17
- Cycle 3: 2 - 18 - 13 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 4: 16 - 9 - 17 - 4 - 16
- Cycle 5: 0 - 6 - 18 - 15 - 0
- Cycle 6: 4 - 17 - 16 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 7: 10 - 12 - 1 - 11 - 10
- Cycle 8: 15 - 18 - 13 - 7 - 15

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3 <2, (13, 7), 18>
- Cycle 7 <10, (1, 11), 12>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [2]
