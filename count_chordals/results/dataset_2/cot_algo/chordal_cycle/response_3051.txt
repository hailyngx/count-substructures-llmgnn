Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) 

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the provided graph are as follows:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 9, 10>
- Cycle 2: <7, 11, 3, 8>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (9, 10)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (3, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles found in the graph since both cycles have one chord each.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
