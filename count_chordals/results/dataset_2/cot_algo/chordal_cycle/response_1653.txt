Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 9) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 9) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 9) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 6, 5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 3, 2, 11, 9, 10, 12, 0)
- Cycle 3: (3, 7, 4, 12, 9, 11, 2, 3)
- Cycle 4: (4, 12, 10, 6, 5, 4)
- Cycle 5: (6, 13, 1, 10, 9, 12, 6)
- Cycle 6: (7, 4, 12, 10, 6, 13, 8, 7)
- Cycle 7: (8, 13, 1, 6, 10, 9, 14, 8)
- Cycle 8: (9, 10, 6, 13, 8, 14, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <4, 12, 6, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
