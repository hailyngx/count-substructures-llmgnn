Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: <5, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 2: <5, 14, 12, 1>
- Cycle 3: <5, 6, 10, 1>
- Cycle 4: <5, 7, 1, 8>
- Cycle 5: <5, 2, 13, 8>
- Cycle 6: <5, 14, 12, 0>
- Cycle 7: <5, 2, 13, 12>
- Cycle 8: <6, 10, 0, 4>
- Cycle 9: <9, 2, 13, 8>
- Cycle 10: <9, 11, 4, 3>
- Cycle 11: <9, 1, 10, 0>
- Cycle 12: <1, 7, 0, 4>
- Cycle 13: <1, 7, 8, 13>
- Cycle 14: <1, 3, 4, 12>
- Cycle 15: <1, 12, 14, 5>
- Cycle 16: <2, 5, 14, 12>
- Cycle 17: <2, 13, 8, 1>
- Cycle 18: <2, 13, 12, 4>
- Cycle 19: <2, 11, 4, 3>
- Cycle 20: <3, 7, 0, 4>
- Cycle 21: <8, 13, 12, 4>
- Cycle 22: <10, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle 23: <10, 0, 4, 3>
- Cycle 24: <12, 1, 3, 4>
- Cycle 25: <12, 13, 8, 1>
- Cycle 26: <12, 14, 5, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, 7, 3, 1> has chord (7, 12)
- <5, 14, 12, 0> has chord (14, 2)
- <5, 7, 1, 8> has chord (1, 13)
- <9, 11, 4, 3> has chord (11, 2)
- <1, 12, 14, 5> has chord (12, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, 7, 3, 1>
- <5, 14, 12, 0>
- <5, 7, 1, 8>
- <9, 11, 4, 3>
- <1, 12, 14, 5>
