Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 6) (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 3) (4, 18) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 16) (2, 12) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 15) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (16, 18) (16, 0) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 12) (13, 14) (6, 15) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 19) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 10, 17, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 19, 18, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 19, 18, 4, 3)
- Cycle 4: (15, 10, 17, 18, 15)
- Cycle 5: (15, 19, 6, 10, 15)
- Cycle 6: (3, 19, 6, 15, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 15, 6, 8, 3)
- Cycle 8: (15, 6, 8, 11, 15)
- Cycle 9: (3, 19, 6, 15, 10, 17, 18, 4, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 15, 19, 6, 10, 17, 18, 4, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <10, 17>, making it a chordal 4-cycle <3, 10, 17, 15>.
- Cycle 2 has a chord <15, 19>, making it a chordal 4-cycle <3, 15, 19, 18>.
- Cycle 3 has a chord <18, 4>, making it a chordal 4-cycle <3, 4, 18, 19>.
- Cycle 4 has a chord <10, 17>, making it a chordal 4-cycle <15, 10, 17, 18>.
- Cycle 5 has a chord <6, 10>, making it a chordal 4-cycle <15, 19, 6, 10>.
- Cycle 6 has a chord <15, 6>, making it a chordal 4-cycle <3, 15, 6, 19>.
- Cycle 7 has a chord <6, 8>, making it a chordal 4-cycle <3, 8, 6, 15>.
- Cycle 8 has a chord <8, 11>, making it a chordal 4-cycle <6, 15, 11, 8>.
- Cycle 9 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 10 does not have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [7].
