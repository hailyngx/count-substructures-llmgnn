Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 1 - 4 - 6
2. Cycle 2: 6 - 3 - 8 - 7 - 6
3. Cycle 3: 6 - 7 - 0 - 9 - 6
4. Cycle 4: 9 - 1 - 3 - 8 - 9
5. Cycle 5: 9 - 7 - 8 - 5 - 9
6. Cycle 6: 1 - 4 - 2 - 8 - 1
7. Cycle 7: 3 - 5 - 8 - 2 - 3
8. Cycle 8: 4 - 2 - 8 - 5 - 4
9. Cycle 9: 8 - 7 - 5 - 3 - 8
10. Cycle 10: 5 - 7 - 0 - 3 - 5

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 1: <6, 4> is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<6, 4, 1, 9>
