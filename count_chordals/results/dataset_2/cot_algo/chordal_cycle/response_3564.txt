Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 11) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 4) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, here are the cycles:
    1. Cycle 1: 9-14-7-12
    2. Cycle 2: 12-6-1-2
    3. Cycle 3: 1-6-4-3
    4. Cycle 4: 6-4-13-10
    5. Cycle 5: 4-11-9-14
    6. Cycle 6: 7-8-11-4
    7. Cycle 7: 11-4-3-2

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
    1. Cycle 1 (9-14-7-12) has one chord: (14, 12)
    2. Cycle 2 (12-6-1-2) has one chord: (6, 1)
    3. Cycle 3 (1-6-4-3) has one chord: (6, 4)
    4. Cycle 4 (6-4-13-10) has one chord: (4, 13) and (6, 10)
    5. Cycle 5 (4-11-9-14) has one chord: (11, 9)
    6. Cycle 6 (7-8-11-4) has one chord: (8, 11)
    7. Cycle 7 (11-4-3-2) has one chord: (4, 3)

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Summary of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<9, 14, 7, 12> (Chord: (14, 12))
<12, 6, 1, 2> (Chord: (6, 1))
<1, 6, 4, 3> (Chord: (6, 4))
<6, 4, 13, 10> (Chords: (4, 13), (6, 10))
<4, 11, 9, 14> (Chord: (11, 9))
<7, 8, 11, 4> (Chord: (8, 11))
<11, 4, 3, 2> (Chord: (4, 3))
