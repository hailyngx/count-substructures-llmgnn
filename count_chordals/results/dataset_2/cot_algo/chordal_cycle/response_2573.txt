Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 5) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 12) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 12) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 3) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (0, 4, 2, 13, 12, 0)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 7, 4, 0, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (6, 10, 0, 9, 6)
        - Cycle 4: (8, 14, 4, 0, 8)
        - Cycle 5: (9, 8, 14, 12, 9)
        - Cycle 6: (11, 5, 7, 14, 11)
        - Cycle 7: (12, 0, 9, 13, 12)
        - Cycle 8: (13, 2, 4, 14, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - Cycle 1 has 4 chords: (0, 2), (4, 13), (2, 12), (13, 0)
        - Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (4, 5)
        - Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (0, 9)
        - Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (4, 8)
        - Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (8, 12)
        - Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (5, 14)
        - Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (0, 13)
        - Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (2, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: None.
