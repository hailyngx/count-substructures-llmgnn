Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 0) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

  - Cycle 1: (6, 9, 7, 4, 6)
  - Cycle 2: (6, 8, 13, 4, 6)
  - Cycle 3: (6, 4, 13, 12, 6)
  - Cycle 4: (6, 0, 11, 2, 6)
  - Cycle 5: (9, 6, 4, 7, 9)
  - Cycle 6: (9, 7, 14, 10, 9)
  - Cycle 7: (4, 6, 8, 13, 4)
  - Cycle 8: (4, 7, 14, 3, 4)
  - Cycle 9: (7, 9, 12, 13, 7)
  - Cycle 10: (8, 6, 4, 7, 8)
  - Cycle 11: (8, 13, 12, 11, 8)
  - Cycle 12: (13, 4, 7, 14, 13)
  - Cycle 13: (13, 8, 5, 0, 13)
  - Cycle 14: (2, 6, 4, 13, 2)
  - Cycle 15: (2, 8, 5, 0, 2)
  - Cycle 16: (2, 13, 12, 11, 2)
  - Cycle 17: (3, 4, 7, 14, 3)
  - Cycle 18: (3, 11, 2, 6, 3)
  - Cycle 19: (11, 2, 8, 5, 11)
  - Cycle 20: (11, 0, 6, 4, 11)
  - Cycle 21: (0, 6, 8, 5, 0)
  - Cycle 22: (0, 11, 12, 13, 0)
  - Cycle 23: (12, 9, 7, 4, 12)
  - Cycle 24: (12, 13, 4, 8, 12)
  - Cycle 25: (12, 2, 11, 0, 12)
  - Cycle 26: (14, 7, 4, 13, 14)
  - Cycle 27: (14, 3, 11, 12, 14)
  - Cycle 28: (14, 10, 9, 6, 14)
  - Cycle 29: (10, 9, 7, 4, 10)
  - Cycle 30: (10, 14, 3, 11, 10)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

  - Cycle 2 <6, (8, 4), 13, 6>
  - Cycle 3 <6, (4, 13), 12, 6>
  - Cycle 8 <4, (7, 14), 3, 4>
  - Cycle 10 <8, (4, 7), 13, 8>
  - Cycle 13 <13, (8, 5), 0, 13>
  - Cycle 16 <2, (8, 5), 0, 2>
  - Cycle 19 <11, (2, 8), 5, 11>
  - Cycle 24 <12, (13, 4), 8, 12>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
  
  There are 30 cycles listed in step 1, and 8 of them have exactly one chord in step 2.
  Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [22].
