Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: (4, 8, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 9, 0, 7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 6, 2, 8, 4)
- Cycle 4: (8, 2, 10, 4, 8)
- Cycle 5: (8, 9, 0, 7, 8)
- Cycle 6: (2, 6, 3, 11, 2)
- Cycle 7: (3, 11, 5, 7, 3)
- Cycle 8: (0, 9, 12, 5, 0)
- Cycle 9: (7, 14, 2, 6, 7)
- Cycle 10: (5, 13, 10, 2, 5)
- Cycle 11: (13, 12, 9, 10, 13)
- Cycle 12: (1, 8, 2, 10, 1)
- Cycle 13: (6, 3, 11, 5, 6)

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles in the above list:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (6, 4), 8, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (9, 8), 4, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (9, 0), 7, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, (7, 0), 9, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <10, (13, 2), 5, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <12, (13, 9), 10, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, (11, 5), 7, 6>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [6].
