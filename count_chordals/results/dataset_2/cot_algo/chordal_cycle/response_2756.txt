Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (3, 5, 2, 3)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (8, 0, 6, 8)
- Cycle 5: (0, 4, 9, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Identifying unique chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (4, 2), 1>
- Chordal cycle 2: <3, (5, 2), 3>
- Chordal cycle 3: <5, (8, 6), 5>
- Chordal cycle 4: <8, (0, 6), 8>
- Chordal cycle 5: <0, (4, 9), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [5].
