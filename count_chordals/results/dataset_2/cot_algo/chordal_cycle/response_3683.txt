Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 15) (21, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 22) (17, 18) (2, 29) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 23) (29, 11) (6, 17) (6, 10) (9, 15) (9, 24) (0, 17) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 13) (20, 4) (20, 19) (28, 12) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 22) (19, 15) (26, 5) (26, 12) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 21) (4, 20) (4, 25) (12, 28) (12, 26) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 5) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 25) (5, 26) (5, 7) (5, 10) (11, 14) (11, 29) (11, 8) (11, 27) (22, 17) (22, 19) (22, 24) (15, 21) (15, 9) (15, 19) (13, 20) (13, 16) (3, 20) (3, 24) (3, 18) (24, 9) (24, 22) (24, 3) (24, 18) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 24) (18, 27) (23, 29) (23, 7) (23, 27) (27, 11) (27, 18) (27, 23) (25, 2) (25, 4) (25, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

(1, 21, 4, 20, 0, 17, 6, 10, 8, 19, 15, 9, 24, 22, 24, 3, 20, 19, 8, 14, 11, 29, 2, 25, 16, 13)
(1, 21, 4, 20, 19, 22, 17, 6, 10, 8, 14, 11, 29, 2, 25, 16, 13)
(21, 15, 9, 24, 22, 17, 6, 10, 8, 19, 20, 0, 17, 6, 10, 8, 14, 11, 29, 2, 25)
(21, 15, 9, 24, 22, 17, 6, 10, 8, 19, 20, 4, 25)
(21, 15, 9, 24, 22, 17, 6, 10, 5, 26, 12, 28)
(11, 29, 2, 25, 16, 13, 20, 19, 8, 14)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <1, (4, 20), 21, 15> - Chord: (4, 20)
2. <1, (4, 20), 21, 15, 9, 24, 22, 17> - Chord: (9, 24)
3. <1, (4, 20), 21, 15, 9, 24, 22, 17, 6, 10, 8> - Chord: (6, 10)
4. <1, (4, 20), 21, 15, 9, 24, 22, 17, 6, 10, 8, 19, 20> - Chord: (19, 20)
5. <1, (4, 20), 21, 15, 9, 24, 22, 17, 6, 10, 5> - Chord: (5, 26)
6. <1, (4, 20), 21, 15, 9, 24, 22, 17, 6, 10, 5, 26, 12> - Chord: (12, 28)
7. <1, (4, 20), 21, 15, 9, 24, 22, 17, 6, 10, 8, 14, 11, 29, 2> - Chord: (2, 25)
8. <1, (4, 20), 21, 15, 9, 24, 22, 17, 6, 10, 8, 14, 11, 29, 2, 25, 16> - Chord: (16, 13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are a total of [8] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
