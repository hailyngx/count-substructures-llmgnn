Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 6) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 2-7-5-8-6-2
- Cycle 2: 0-3-7-5-14-0
- Cycle 3: 1-6-8-5-14-1
- Cycle 4: 9-1-14-5-13-9
- Cycle 5: 10-9-11-8-13-10
- Cycle 6: 11-9-12-6-1-11
- Cycle 7: 12-6-8-13-4-12
- Cycle 8: 0-14-1-10-11-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (7, 14)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (8, 5)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (8, 6)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (1, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
As there are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<2, 5, 8, 6> with chord (5, 8)
<0, 7, 14, 3> with chord (7, 14)
<1, 6, 8, 5> with chord (8, 5)
<9, 1, 14, 5> with chord (1, 5)
<10, 9, 11, 8> with chord (9, 8)
<11, 9, 12, 6> with chord (9, 6)
<12, 6, 8, 13> with chord (8, 6)
<0, 14, 1, 10> with chord (1, 10)
