Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (6, 5) (6, 18) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 17) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 15) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 19) (17, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 15) (16, 8) (16, 1) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 12) (3, 2) (3, 13) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 15) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
[4]

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, (1, 16), 19, 7>.
