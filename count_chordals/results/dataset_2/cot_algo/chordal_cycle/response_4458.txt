Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <6, 9, 13, 6>
- Cycle 2: <6, 9, 8, 6>
- Cycle 3: <6, 9, 2, 6>
- Cycle 4: <6, 9, 13, 8, 6>
- Cycle 5: <6, 9, 13, 8, 11, 1, 14, 6>
- Cycle 6: <6, 9, 13, 8, 2, 3, 4, 6>
- Cycle 7: <6, 9, 13, 8, 2, 5, 14, 6>

- Cycle 9: <6, 14, 1, 11, 2, 3, 4, 6>
- Cycle 10: <6, 14, 1, 11, 2, 5, 14, 6>
- Cycle 11: <9, 6, 14, 1, 11, 8, 13, 9>
- Cycle 12: <9, 6, 14, 1, 11, 2, 3, 9>
- Cycle 13: <9, 6, 14, 1, 11, 2, 5, 14, 9>
- Cycle 14: <9, 8, 13, 4, 3, 2, 9>
- Cycle 15: <9, 8, 13, 4, 12, 7, 2, 9>
- Cycle 16: <9, 2, 3, 4, 12, 7, 2, 9>
- Cycle 17: <1, 11, 8, 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 10, 1>
- Cycle 18: <1, 14, 5, 12, 7, 2, 11, 8, 13, 1>
- Cycle 19: <2, 3, 0, 14, 5, 12, 7, 2>
- Cycle 20: <2, 5, 14, 6, 9, 8, 11, 2>
- Cycle 21: <3, 0, 14, 6, 9, 8, 11, 3>
- Cycle 22: <3, 4, 7, 12, 5, 14, 0, 3>
- Cycle 23: <4, 9, 2, 11, 8, 13, 4>
- Cycle 24: <5, 2, 7, 12, 4, 3, 0, 14, 5>
- Cycle 25: <5, 11, 2, 9, 6, 14, 0, 3, 5>
- Cycle 26: <5, 12, 7, 4, 9, 13, 8, 11, 5>
- Cycle 27: <11, 8, 13, 4, 3, 2, 5, 14, 1>
- Cycle 28: <12, 7, 4, 9, 8, 2, 11, 5, 12>
- Cycle 29: <0, 3, 2, 11, 8, 13, 9, 6, 14, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <6, 9, 13, 8, 6> (Chord: (9, 8))
- <6, 9, 13, 8, 2, 3, 4, 6> (Chord: (13, 4))
- <6, 14, 1, 11, 8, 13, 9, 6> (Chord: (1, 9))
- <9, 8, 13, 4, 12, 7, 2, 9> (Chord: (13, 7))
- <1, 11, 8, 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 10, 1> (Chord: (4, 10))
- <3, 4, 7, 12, 5, 14, 0, 3> (Chord: (7, 0))
- <5, 11, 2, 9, 6, 14, 0, 3, 5> (Chord: (11, 0))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 23 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [23].
