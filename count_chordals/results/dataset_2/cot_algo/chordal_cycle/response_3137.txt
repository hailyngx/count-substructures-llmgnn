Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (5, 12) (5, 7) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 1) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 18) (3, 8) (3, 9) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (19, 17) (4, 1) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 16) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 4) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 17) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 17) (14, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles:
1. (0, 7, 2, 8) - 4-cycle
2. (0, 12, 1, 16) - 4-cycle
3. (0, 12, 16, 15) - 4-cycle
4. (0, 15, 13, 8) - 4-cycle
5. (0, 15, 16, 12) - 4-cycle
6. (1, 12, 16, 15) - 4-cycle
7. (1, 4, 16, 15) - 4-cycle
8. (3, 8, 13, 6) - 4-cycle
9. (4, 1, 12, 16) - 4-cycle
10. (9, 3, 8, 13) - 4-cycle
11. (9, 11, 0, 12) - 4-cycle
12. (9, 11, 18, 10) - 4-cycle
13. (9, 17, 16, 12) - 4-cycle
14. (9, 17, 18, 10) - 4-cycle
15. (10, 0, 7, 2) - 4-cycle
16. (10, 1, 12, 16) - 4-cycle
17. (10, 18, 17, 16) - 4-cycle
18. (11, 0, 7, 2) - 4-cycle
19. (11, 9, 3, 8) - 4-cycle
20. (11, 18, 17, 16) - 4-cycle
21. (12, 0, 7, 6) - 4-cycle
22. (12, 1, 4, 16) - 4-cycle
23. (12, 16, 17, 9) - 4-cycle
24. (15, 13, 8, 3) - 4-cycle
25. (15, 16, 17, 9) - 4-cycle
26. (16, 1, 4, 12) - 4-cycle
27. (16, 14, 1, 4) - 4-cycle
28. (16, 15, 0, 11) - 4-cycle
29. (16, 17, 18, 11) - 4-cycle
30. (17, 16, 12, 1) - 4-cycle
31. (17, 18, 11, 9) - 4-cycle
32. (18, 10, 0, 12) - 4-cycle
33. (18, 11, 0, 7) - 4-cycle
34. (19, 17, 16, 15) - 4-cycle

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (4, 12), 16>
2. <1, (14, 16), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
