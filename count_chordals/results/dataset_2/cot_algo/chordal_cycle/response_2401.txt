Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 10) (18, 5) (18, 2) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 15) (0, 5) (0, 6) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (19, 2) (15, 16) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (10, 2) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
1. Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 3 - 1 - 5
2. Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 3 - 13 - 5
3. Cycle 3: 5 - 18 - 2 - 11 - 5
4. Cycle 4: 2 - 6 - 0 - 5 - 2
5. Cycle 5: 2 - 10 - 6 - 3 - 2
6. Cycle 6: 2 - 18 - 5 - 0 - 2
7. Cycle 7: 16 - 7 - 12 - 4 - 16
8. Cycle 8: 16 - 15 - 1 - 3 - 16
9. Cycle 9: 16 - 15 - 7 - 12 - 16
10. Cycle 10: 15 - 17 - 14 - 13 - 15

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
1. Chordal Cycle 1: <1, (3, 13), 5>
2. Chordal Cycle 2: <2, (6, 10), 5>
3. Chordal Cycle 3: <2, (0, 18), 5>
4. Chordal Cycle 4: <2, (6, 10), 3>
5. Chordal Cycle 5: <7, (4, 12), 16>
6. Chordal Cycle 6: <15, (1, 17), 16>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which are the cycles without any chords:
[4]

Therefore, the final count is [4].
