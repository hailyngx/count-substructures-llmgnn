Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 6) (10, 17) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 15) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 4) (18, 10) (18, 12) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 9) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 7) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 16) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 19) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 3) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 8) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 12) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <0, 6, 13, 11, 0>
        - Cycle 2: <2, 4, 10, 11, 2>
        - Cycle 3: <3, 12, 18, 10, 11, 2, 16, 3>
        - Cycle 4: <4, 9, 10, 11, 4>
        - Cycle 5: <5, 7, 13, 6, 17, 10, 11, 15, 16, 2, 4, 9, 12, 8, 0, 6, 13, 7, 5>
        - Cycle 6: <8, 0, 6, 13, 7, 8>
        - Cycle 7: <12, 18, 10, 11, 12>
        - Cycle 8: <14, 13, 6, 17, 10, 11, 15, 14>
        - Cycle 9: <15, 16, 2, 11, 15>
        - Cycle 10: <19, 16, 2, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1 has no chord.
        - Cycle 2 has no chord.
        - Cycle 3 has no chord.
        - Cycle 4 has no chord.
        - Cycle 5 fits the definition of a chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord (6, 13).
        - Cycle 6 has no chord.
        - Cycle 7 has no chord.
        - Cycle 8 has no chord.
        - Cycle 9 has no chord.
        - Cycle 10 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        - There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Thus, the final number inside brackets is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, (6, 13), 17)>.
