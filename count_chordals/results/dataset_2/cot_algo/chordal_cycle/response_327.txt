Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (16, 11) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 7) (10, 3) (10, 12) (4, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 18) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 2) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 19) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 7) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 1) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 3) (1, 7) (1, 12) (13, 9) (13, 12) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 19)

- Cycle 1: 0-8-2-18-0 (length 4)
- Cycle 2: 2-8-0-17-2 (length 4)
- Cycle 3: 3-10-12-1-7-3 (length 5)
- Cycle 4: 4-19-15-7-1-12-10-3-5-4 (length 9)
- Cycle 5: 5-0-8-9-13-12-14-6-5 (length 8)
- Cycle 6: 5-3-10-12-13-9-8-0-17-5 (length 9)
- Cycle 7: 5-6-14-18-2-8-0-5 (length 7)
- Cycle 8: 5-17-0-8-9-13-12-14-18-5 (length 9)
- Cycle 9: 6-5-0-17-7-1-12-13-9-6 (length 9)
- Cycle 10: 7-1-12-10-3-19-15-7 (length 7)
- Cycle 11: 9-8-0-5-6-18-14-12-13-9 (length 9)
- Cycle 12: 9-13-12-14-17-0-8-9 (length 7)
- Cycle 13: 10-3-5-6-14-17-0-8-2-10 (length 9)
- Cycle 14: 12-10-3-19-15-7-1-12 (length 7)
- Cycle 15: 12-13-9-8-0-17-14-12 (length 7)
- Cycle 16: 14-6-5-3-10-12-13-9-14 (length 8)
- Cycle 17: 15-19-4-5-0-17-14-18-15 (length 8)
- Cycle 18: 17-0-8-2-18-14-12-13-17 (length 8)
- Cycle 19: 18-6-5-0-8-9-13-12-18 (length 8)
- Cycle 20: 19-15-7-1-12-13-9-8-19 (length 8)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (8, 18), 2, 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (8, 17), 0, 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (10, 12), 1, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (19, 15), 7, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (0, 8), 9, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, (3, 12), 10, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, (6, 18), 14, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, (17, 8), 9, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <5, (18, 14), 12, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <6, (0, 17), 7, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <7, (1, 12), 10, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <9, (8, 0), 5, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <10, (3, 19), 15, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <12, (13, 9), 8, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <14, (6, 5), 3, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <15, (19, 4), 5, 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <17, (0, 8), 2, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <18, (6, 5), 0, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <19, (15, 7), 1, 12>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [19]
