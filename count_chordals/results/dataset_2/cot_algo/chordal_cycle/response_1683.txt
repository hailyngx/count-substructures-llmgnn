Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 26) (9, 24) (9, 20) (9, 1) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 0) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 28) (23, 19) (12, 22) (12, 17) (12, 3) (27, 24) (27, 8) (15, 22) (15, 10) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 8) (0, 22) (0, 21) (0, 17) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 21) (19, 23) (19, 0) (26, 6) (26, 10) (26, 25) (26, 17) (21, 0) (21, 14) (21, 3) (28, 23) (28, 16) (28, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 29) (13, 5) (13, 7) (17, 12) (17, 20) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 7) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 25) (16, 2) (3, 12) (3, 21) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 26) (10, 4) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 29) (1, 9) (1, 28) (1, 16) (1, 29) (1, 25) (29, 5) (29, 7) (29, 1) (8, 27) (8, 20) (24, 9) (24, 27) (25, 26) (25, 5) (25, 16) (25, 1) (25, 2) (2, 6) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 25) 

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in this graph are:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 2 - 16 - 25 - 26 - 2
- Cycle 2: 1 - 16 - 25 - 26 - 1
- Cycle 3: 2 - 6 - 26 - 25 - 2
- Cycle 4: 2 - 3 - 21 - 14 - 2
- Cycle 5: 26 - 10 - 14 - 21 - 26
- Cycle 6: 2 - 25 - 5 - 13 - 2
- Cycle 7: 2 - 25 - 26 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 8: 25 - 16 - 28 - 23 - 25
- Cycle 9: 25 - 16 - 2 - 3 - 25

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
- <2, 16, 25, 26> has one chord: (2, 25)
- <26, 10, 14, 21> has one chord: (10, 21)
- <25, 16, 28, 23> has one chord: (16, 28)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are <2, 16, 25, 26>, <26, 10, 14, 21>, and <25, 16, 28, 23>.
