Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 15) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 2) (19, 5) (19, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (15, 5) (15, 11) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 2) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 7) (0, 17) (0, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 16) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 4) (16, 8) (8, 17) (8, 16) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 1) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-6-7-5
- Cycle 3: 5-15-11-10-5
- Cycle 4: 13-16-2-18-13
- Cycle 5: 13-16-4-0-13

Step 2:
Checking the cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (6, 1)
- Cycle 2 has one chord (6, 7)
- Cycle 3 has no chords
- Cycle 4 has one chord (2, 18)
- Cycle 5 has one chord (16, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, (6, 1), 9)>
<5, (6, 7), 9)>
<13, (2, 18), 16)>
