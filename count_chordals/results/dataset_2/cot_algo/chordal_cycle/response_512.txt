Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1-5-2-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-7-4-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-7-0-1
- Cycle 4: 1-8-9-7-1
- Cycle 5: 1-8-0-7-1
- Cycle 6: 2-5-7-4-2
- Cycle 7: 2-4-7-0-2
- Cycle 8: 2-9-8-1-2
- Cycle 9: 2-4-1-5-2
- Cycle 10: 3-5-2-4-3
- Cycle 11: 3-9-8-1-3
- Cycle 12: 3-4-7-6-3
- Cycle 13: 3-0-8-7-3
- Cycle 14: 3-6-7-4-3
- Cycle 15: 3-4-1-8-3
- Cycle 16: 4-7-6-3-4
- Cycle 17: 4-1-8-9-4
- Cycle 18: 4-1-5-2-4
- Cycle 19: 5-7-4-1-5
- Cycle 20: 5-2-9-3-5
- Cycle 21: 6-7-4-3-6
- Cycle 22: 7-5-2-9-7
- Cycle 23: 7-4-1-8-7
- Cycle 24: 7-0-3-6-7
- Cycle 25: 8-9-2-4-8
- Cycle 26: 8-7-5-2-8
- Cycle 27: 8-0-3-6-8
- Cycle 28: 9-1-4-7-9
- Cycle 29: 9-8-7-4-9

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- <1, (5, 2), 4> (Cycle 1)
- <2, (5, 7), 4> (Cycle 6)
- <3, (9, 8), 1> (Cycle 11)
- <4, (7, 0), 3> (Cycle 16)
- <5, (7, 9), 1> (Cycle 23)
- <6, (7, 6), 3> (Cycle 21)
- <7, (5, 9), 2> (Cycle 20)
- <8, (8, 2), 5> (Cycle 25)
- <9, (4, 1), 8> (Cycle 28)
- <10, (9, 4), 7> (Cycle 29)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = [10]
