Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 4) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 8) (12, 3) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 9, 11, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 5, 7, 6, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 1, 10, 2, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 5, 9, 13, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 0, 8, 12, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 3, 6, 4, 7)
- Cycle 7: (10, 1, 13, 8, 10)
- Cycle 8: (10, 6, 7, 3, 10)
- Cycle 9: (13, 9, 11, 10, 13)
- Cycle 10: (13, 3, 7, 0, 13)
- Cycle 11: (0, 9, 5, 4, 0)
- Cycle 12: (6, 7, 0, 4, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 11)
- Cycle 2 doesn't have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 3 doesn't have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (0, 8)
- Cycle 6 doesn't have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 7 doesn't have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 8 doesn't have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 9 doesn't have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 10 doesn't have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 12 doesn't have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (5, 11), 4)>
<4, (9, 13), 7)>
<11, (9, 5), 0)>
