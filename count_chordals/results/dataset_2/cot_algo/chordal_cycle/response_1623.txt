Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 4, 8, 2, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (7, 6, 3, 0, 7)
        - Cycle 3: (9, 1, 2, 14, 9)
        - Cycle 4: (10, 6, 7, 14, 10)
        - Cycle 5: (11, 13, 10, 6, 11)
        - Cycle 6: (12, 0, 3, 6, 12)
        - Cycle 7: (13, 2, 8, 4, 13)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has chord (4, 2)
        - Cycle 2 has chord (6, 0)
        - Cycle 3 has chord (1, 14)
        - Cycle 4 has chord (7, 14)
        - Cycle 5 has chord (10, 6)
        - Cycle 6 has chord (0, 3)
        - Cycle 7 has chord (2, 8)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        - <5, 4, 8, 2>
        - <7, 6, 3, 0>
        - <9, 1, 2, 14>
        - <10, 6, 7, 14>
        - <11, 13, 10, 6>
        - <12, 0, 3, 6>
        - <13, 2, 8, 4>
