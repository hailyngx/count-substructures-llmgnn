Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 18) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 15) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 19) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 19) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 17) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 19) (7, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-0-16-8-13-12-3
- Cycle 2: 3-0-16-17-3
- Cycle 3: 4-15-18-11-14-9-12-3-4
- Cycle 4: 4-15-18-19-7-1-13-12-4
- Cycle 5: 4-3-0-19-7-1-13-12-4
- Cycle 6: 4-3-0-19-18-15-5-12-4
- Cycle 7: 4-3-2-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (8, 13)
- Cycle 2 has no chord
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has no chord
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has chord (5, 18)
- Cycle 7 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 3 chordless cycles found, so the final number is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (13, 8), 5>
- <2, (5, 18), 7>
