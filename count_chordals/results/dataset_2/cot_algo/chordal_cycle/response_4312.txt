Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 7) (14, 9) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (2, 6, 10, 8, 2)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 5, 13, 4, 0)
        - Cycle 3: (7, 2, 6, 1, 7)
        - Cycle 4: (3, 5, 0, 7, 3)
        - Cycle 5: (13, 5, 8, 12, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Cycle 1 has one chord: (6, 8)
        - Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 4)
        - Cycle 3 has one chord: (2, 6)
        - Cycle 4 has one chord: (0, 7)
        - Cycle 5 has one chord: (5, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

        There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
        - <2, (6, 8), 10>
        - <0, (5, 4), 13>
        - <7, (2, 6), 1>
        - <3, (0, 7), 5>
        - <13, (5, 12), 8>
