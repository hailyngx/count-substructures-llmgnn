Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 24) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 7) (2, 29) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 1) (29, 0) (29, 23) (6, 13) (28, 4) (28, 18) (21, 19) (21, 22) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 27) (22, 9) (22, 21) (14, 26) (14, 12) (14, 19) (26, 14) (26, 20) (26, 3) (17, 16) (17, 27) (17, 11) (25, 1) (11, 17) (0, 29) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 24) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 12) (1, 18) (27, 8) (27, 17) (27, 24) (27, 18) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 4) (20, 26) (20, 3) (4, 28) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 23) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 27) (24, 12) (24, 23) (18, 5) (18, 28) (18, 1) (18, 27) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 24) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 15) (7, 5) (7, 9) (19, 21) (19, 14) (23, 29) (23, 4) (23, 24) (23, 3) (3, 26) (3, 16) (3, 20) (3, 13) (3, 23) (15, 2) (15, 13) 

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <5, (7, 18), 24)>.
    
    Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
    - Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 22 - 21 - 19 - 14 - 26 - 3 - 16 - 17 - 27 - 8 - 10 - 0 - 29 - 2 - 15 - 13 - 6 (length 18)
    - Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 22 - 21 - 19 - 14 - 26 - 3 - 16 - 17 - 27 - 8 - 10 - 24 (length 14)
    
    Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - Cycle 1 has no chord.
    - Cycle 2 has the chord (10, 24).
    
    Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 1.
    
    Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [1].
