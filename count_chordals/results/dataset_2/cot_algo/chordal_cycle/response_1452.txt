Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 1, 4, 9, 5>
- Cycle 3: <9, 4, 7, 0, 9>
- Cycle 4: <6, 1, 4, 9, 6>
- Cycle 5: <4, 7, 0, 1, 4>
- Cycle 6: <4, 1, 8, 5, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 3, 8, 5, 4>
- Cycle 8: <7, 0, 1, 8, 7>
- Cycle 9: <0, 1, 5, 8, 0>
- Cycle 10: <8, 5, 9, 4, 8>
- Cycle 11: <1, 6, 3, 4, 1>
- Cycle 12: <1, 0, 7, 8, 1>
- Cycle 13: <1, 2, 3, 4, 1>
- Cycle 14: <3, 6, 1, 8, 3>
- Cycle 15: <3, 4, 9, 6, 3>
- Cycle 16: <3, 8, 5, 1, 3>
- Cycle 17: <2, 4, 9, 6, 2>
- Cycle 18: <2, 1, 5, 8, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The cycle <5, 9, 6, 1, 5> has one chord: (9, 1)
- The cycle <5, 1, 4, 9, 5> has one chord: (1, 9)
- The cycle <9, 4, 7, 0, 9> has one chord: (4, 7)
- The cycle <6, 1, 4, 9, 6> has one chord: (1, 9)
- The cycle <4, 7, 0, 1, 4> has one chord: (7, 1)
- The cycle <4, 1, 8, 5, 4> has one chord: (1, 5)
- The cycle <4, 3, 8, 5, 4> has one chord: (3, 8)
- The cycle <7, 0, 1, 8, 7> has one chord: (0, 8)
- The cycle <0, 1, 5, 8, 0> has one chord: (1, 8)
- The cycle <8, 5, 9, 4, 8> has one chord: (5, 4)
- The cycle <1, 6, 3, 4, 1> has one chord: (6, 3)
- The cycle <1, 0, 7, 8, 1> has one chord: (0, 7)
- The cycle <1, 2, 3, 4, 1> has one chord: (2, 3)
- The cycle <3, 6, 1, 8, 3> has one chord: (6, 8)
- The cycle <3, 4, 9, 6, 3> has one chord: (4, 6)
- The cycle <3, 8, 5, 1, 3> has one chord: (8, 1)
- The cycle <2, 4, 9, 6, 2> has one chord: (4, 9)
- The cycle <2, 1, 5, 8, 2> has one chord: (1, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 18 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [18].
