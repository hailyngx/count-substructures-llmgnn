Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (15, 8) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 18) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 17) (9, 15) (9, 13) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 2) (0, 19) (1, 7) (1, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 1) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 2-8-6-10-2
- Cycle 2: 2-8-15-9-13-14-2
- Cycle 3: 2-8-15-16-17-12-6-11-7-10-2
- Cycle 4: 3-17-16-8-6-12-19-0-2-14-13-3
- Cycle 5: 3-17-12-6-8-15-9-13-3
- Cycle 6: 3-18-6-8-15-16-17-12-11-7-3
- Cycle 7: 5-4-7-3-17-16-8-15-9-13-14-5
- Cycle 8: 5-7-3-18-6-12-17-16-8-2-0-19-5
- Cycle 9: 5-7-10-2-8-15-16-17-3-13-9-5
- Cycle 10: 5-7-10-1-7-11-12-6-8-15-9-13-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 2-8-6-10-2 has chord (6, 10)
- Cycle 2: 2-8-15-9-13-14-2 has chord (9, 14)
- Cycle 3: 2-8-15-16-17-12-6-11-7-10-2 has chord (16, 7)
- Cycle 4: 3-17-16-8-6-12-19-0-2-14-13-3 has chord (12, 19)
- Cycle 5: 3-17-12-6-8-15-9-13-3 has chord (15, 9)
- Cycle 6: 3-18-6-8-15-16-17-12-11-7-3 has chord (16, 11)
- Cycle 7: 5-4-7-3-17-16-8-15-9-13-14-5 is chordal with chord (8, 14)
- Cycle 8: 5-7-3-18-6-12-17-16-8-2-0-19-5 has chord (8, 19)
- Cycle 9: 5-7-10-2-8-15-16-17-3-13-9-5 has chord (15, 13)
- Cycle 10: 5-7-10-1-7-11-12-6-8-15-9-13-5 has chord (6, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<2, 8, 15, 16>, chord: (16, 7)
<3, 17, 16, 8>, chord: (12, 19)
<3, 17, 12, 6>, chord: (16, 11)
<5, 4, 7, 3>, chord: (8, 14)
<5, 7, 3, 18>, chord: (8, 19)
<5, 7, 10, 1>, chord: (6, 9)
