- Cycle 6: (21, 7, 18, 22)
- Cycle 7: (21, 7, 27, 9)
- Cycle 8: (21, 24, 5, 4)
- Cycle 9: (8, 18, 22, 2)
- Cycle 10: (8, 18, 22, 12)

- Cycle 20: (20, 16, 6, 27)
- Cycle 21: (20, 14, 26, 12)
- Cycle 22: (2, 22, 18, 7)
- Cycle 23: (2, 8, 17, 10)
- Cycle 24: (2, 8, 6, 16)
- Cycle 25: (2, 14, 26, 12)
- Cycle 26: (29, 17, 10, 1)
- Cycle 27: (29, 17, 8, 13)
- Cycle 28: (29, 17, 10, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (22, 23), 14, 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (5, 4), 10, 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <7, (18, 22), 21, 27>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, (17, 29), 13, 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <10, (17, 29), 1, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <13, (8, 18), 17, 29>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <20, (16, 6), 14, 26>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [28]
