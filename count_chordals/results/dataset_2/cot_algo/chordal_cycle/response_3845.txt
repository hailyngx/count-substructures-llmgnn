Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (1, 4) (1, 13) (9, 13) (9, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (4, 7, 13, 8, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (3, 7, 5, 2, 3)
        - Cycle 3: (6, 12, 2, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 4: (0, 6, 8, 12, 0)
        - Cycle 5: (11, 3, 7, 10, 11)
        - Cycle 6: (13, 12, 6, 4, 13)
        - Cycle 7: (2, 12, 14, 3, 2)
        - Cycle 8: (10, 7, 13, 9, 10)
        - Cycle 9: (0, 2, 12, 14, 0)
        - Cycle 10: (1, 13, 9, 11, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph, so the final count is [0].
