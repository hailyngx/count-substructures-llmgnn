Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (17, 1) (17, 5) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 18) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 18) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 5) (6, 15) (6, 19) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 13) (2, 0) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (4, 11) (4, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 3-15-7-3
- Cycle 2: 15-7-0-15
- Cycle 3: 7-0-12-7
- Cycle 4: 0-12-14-0
- Cycle 5: 12-14-1-17
- Cycle 6: 14-1-18-12
- Cycle 7: 1-18-5-17
- Cycle 8: 18-5-19-13
- Cycle 9: 5-19-6-15
- Cycle 10: 19-6-15-0
- Cycle 11: 6-15-3-7
- Cycle 12: 9-15-7-0
- Cycle 13: 16-4-11-10
- Cycle 14: 4-11-3-15
- Cycle 15: 13-2-0-12
- Cycle 16: 2-0-15-3
- Cycle 17: 8-13-10-11

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: <3, (15, 7), 3>
- Cycle 2: <15, (7, 0), 15>
- Cycle 3: <7, (0, 12), 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, (12, 14), 0>
- Cycle 5: <12, (14, 1), 12>
- Cycle 6: <14, (1, 18), 14>
- Cycle 7: <1, (18, 5), 1>
- Cycle 8: <18, (5, 19), 18>
- Cycle 9: <5, (19, 6), 5>
- Cycle 10: <19, (6, 15), 19>
- Cycle 11: <6, (15, 3), 6>
- Cycle 12: <9, (15, 7), 9>
- Cycle 13: <16, (4, 11), 16>
- Cycle 14: <4, (11, 3), 4>
- Cycle 15: <13, (2, 0), 13>
- Cycle 16: <2, (0, 15), 2>
- Cycle 17: <8, (13, 10), 8>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0], as all cycles have exactly one chord.
