Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 29) (12, 27) (12, 17) (27, 13) (27, 12) (27, 18) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 23) (28, 6) (28, 17) (4, 3) (18, 27) (18, 11) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 23) (14, 15) (14, 16) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 16) (26, 15) (26, 7) (7, 26) (7, 15) (7, 24) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 15) (8, 20) (9, 16) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 17) (11, 2) (23, 6) (23, 14) (23, 5) (23, 11) (23, 21) (10, 13) (10, 22) (10, 6) (10, 0) (21, 5) (21, 23) (21, 24) (20, 8) (20, 3) (20, 19) (29, 22) (29, 25) (29, 3) (17, 12) (17, 28) (17, 18) (17, 11) (1, 5) (1, 25) (3, 4) (3, 20) (3, 29) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 25) (2, 11) (2, 19) (19, 20) (19, 2) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 21) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 5) (16, 9) 

Response:
Let's go step by step to find the chordal 4-cycles in this graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 15, 25>
- Cycle 2: <0, 10, 6, 23>
- Cycle 3: <0, 10, 22, 29>
- Cycle 4: <0, 15, 26, 7>
- Cycle 5: <0, 24, 21, 5>
- Cycle 6: <3, 4, 20, 19>
- Cycle 7: <3, 20, 8, 19>
- Cycle 8: <3, 29, 22, 10>
- Cycle 9: <10, 6, 23, 11>
- Cycle 10: <10, 13, 27, 18>
- Cycle 11: <11, 17, 18, 27>
- Cycle 12: <11, 17, 28, 6>
- Cycle 13: <11, 2, 19, 20>
- Cycle 14: <13, 22, 29, 25>
- Cycle 15: <13, 27, 12, 17>
- Cycle 16: <14, 0, 10, 22>
- Cycle 17: <14, 0, 15, 26>
- Cycle 18: <14, 16, 9, 25>
- Cycle 19: <14, 23, 5, 21>
- Cycle 20: <15, 0, 24, 21>
- Cycle 21: <15, 7, 24, 21>
- Cycle 22: <15, 25, 1, 5>
- Cycle 23: <16, 13, 27, 18>
- Cycle 24: <16, 5, 21, 24>
- Cycle 25: <17, 11, 2, 19>
- Cycle 26: <17, 28, 6, 10>
- Cycle 27: <18, 27, 12, 17>
- Cycle 28: <20, 3, 29, 22>
- Cycle 29: <21, 5, 23, 11>
- Cycle 30: <23, 14, 0, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <0, (10, 22), 29>
- The total number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1].
