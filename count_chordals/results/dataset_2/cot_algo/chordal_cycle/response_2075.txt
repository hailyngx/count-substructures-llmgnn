Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (14, 13) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 9) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 2: 4 - 8 - 5 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 10 - 6 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 4: 7 - 12 - 5 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 5: 7 - 11 - 9 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 6: 8 - 13 - 3 - 2 - 8
- Cycle 7: 13 - 14 - 1 - 8 - 13
- Cycle 8: 5 - 3 - 2 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 9: 6 - 3 - 2 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 10: 6 - 10 - 0 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 11: 7 - 6 - 5 - 12 - 7
- Cycle 12: 7 - 11 - 9 - 12 - 7
- Cycle 13: 4 - 10 - 0 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 14: 9 - 11 - 7 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 15: 9 - 3 - 13 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 16: 1 - 13 - 14 - 1

Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:

- Cycle 1 has a chord <5, 6>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <4, 5>
- Cycle 3 has a chord <6, 7>
- Cycle 4 has a chord <7, 8>
- Cycle 5 has a chord <4, 9>
- Cycle 6 has a chord <8, 13>
- Cycle 7 has a chord <8, 13>
- Cycle 8 has a chord <2, 8>
- Cycle 9 has a chord <2, 8>
- Cycle 10 has a chord <6, 10>
- Cycle 11 has a chord <5, 12>
- Cycle 12 has a chord <7, 11>
- Cycle 13 has a chord <4, 9>
- Cycle 14 has a chord <4, 9>
- Cycle 15 has a chord <9, 13>
- Cycle 16 has a chord <13, 14>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [16]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<4, (5, 6), 7>
<4, (4, 5), 8>
<4, (6, 7), 10>
<7, (7, 8), 12>
<7, (4, 9), 11>
<8, (8, 13), 5>
<8, (2, 8), 6>
<5, (6, 10), 3>
<6, (5, 12), 7>
<9, (7, 11), 12>
<13, (8, 13), 1>
<13, (2, 8), 3>
<10, (6, 10), 0>
<9, (4, 9), 11>
<9, (4, 9), 11>
<1, (13, 14), 13>
