Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle: (1, 4, 15, 11, 1)
- Cycle: (1, 4, 24, 14, 1)
- Cycle: (1, 11, 12, 22, 21, 10, 13, 9, 17, 3, 26, 2, 15, 4)
- Cycle: (4, 15, 26, 2, 3, 17, 9, 22, 21, 28, 0, 20, 27, 6)
- Cycle: (5, 0, 20, 27, 15, 4, 24, 14, 7, 10, 21, 22, 8, 23, 5)
- Cycle: (5, 0, 20, 27, 6, 18, 19, 18, 6, 27, 20, 13, 10, 21, 22, 12, 29, 21, 28, 7)
- Cycle: (6, 18, 19, 18, 6)
- Cycle: (9, 22, 21, 28, 0, 20, 27, 15, 4, 24, 14, 7, 10, 21)
- Cycle: (13, 9, 22, 21, 28, 0, 20, 27, 15, 4, 24, 14, 7, 10)
- Cycle: (22, 21, 28, 0, 20, 27, 15, 4, 24, 14, 7)

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle: (1, 4, 15, 11, 1) -> Chord: (4, 11)
- Cycle: (1, 4, 24, 14, 1) -> Chord: (4, 14)
- Cycle: (1, 11, 12, 22, 21, 10, 13, 9, 17, 3, 26, 2, 15, 4) -> No chord
- Cycle: (4, 15, 26, 2, 3, 17, 9, 22, 21, 28, 0, 20, 27, 6) -> No chord
- Cycle: (5, 0, 20, 27, 15, 4, 24, 14, 7, 10, 21, 22, 8, 23, 5) -> No chord
- Cycle: (5, 0, 20, 27, 6, 18, 19, 18, 6, 27, 20, 13, 10, 21, 22, 12, 29, 21, 28, 7) -> No chord
- Cycle: (6, 18, 19, 18, 6) -> No chord
- Cycle: (9, 22, 21, 28, 0, 20, 27, 15, 4, 24, 14, 7, 10, 21) -> Chord: (9, 21)
- Cycle: (13, 9, 22, 21, 28, 0, 20, 27, 15, 4, 24, 14, 7, 10) -> Chord: (9, 21)
- Cycle: (22, 21, 28, 0, 20, 27, 15, 4, 24, 14, 7) -> Chord: (15, 21)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (4, 11), 15, 11>
- <1, (4, 14), 24, 14>
- <22, (9, 21), 28, 21, 15, 4, 24, 14, 7>
