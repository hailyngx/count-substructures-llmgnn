Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-7-4-9-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-9-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-2-7-4-1
- Cycle 5: 1-2-7-8-1
- Cycle 6: 1-2-9-5-1
- Cycle 7: 1-2-9-6-1
- Cycle 8: 1-2-5-6-1
- Cycle 9: 1-3-6-9-1
- Cycle 10: 1-3-6-8-1
- Cycle 11: 1-3-6-5-1

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (2, 5), 9>
- <1, 7, 4, 9>
- <1, 6, (5, 9)>
- <1, (2, 7), 4>

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [7]

Therefore, the final count is [7].
