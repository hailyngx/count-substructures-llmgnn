Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 6) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 6) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-3-11-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-11-8-5
- Cycle 3: 5-7-10-13-5
- Cycle 4: 5-9-14-0-5
- Cycle 5: 1-11-6-4-1
- Cycle 6: 1-8-11-3-1
- Cycle 7: 11-3-14-9-11
- Cycle 8: 11-6-4-12-11
- Cycle 9: 11-1-8-13-11
- Cycle 10: 8-1-5-7-8
- Cycle 11: 8-11-3-13-8
- Cycle 12: 13-10-7-3-13
- Cycle 13: 13-8-4-6-13
- Cycle 14: 13-0-10-7-13
- Cycle 15: 4-8-1-5-4
- Cycle 16: 4-6-12-14-4
- Cycle 17: 4-12-3-11-4
- Cycle 18: 0-10-13-3-0
- Cycle 19: 0-14-9-5-0
- Cycle 20: 0-6-12-14-0
- Cycle 21: 14-9-3-12-14
- Cycle 22: 14-0-6-12-14
- Cycle 23: 14-2-5-9-14
- Cycle 24: 3-9-14-12-3
- Cycle 25: 3-11-1-5-3
- Cycle 26: 3-13-8-11-3
- Cycle 27: 3-13-7-10-3
- Cycle 28: 3-7-5-1-3
- Cycle 29: 3-12-4-6-3
- Cycle 30: 12-4-6-0-12
- Cycle 31: 12-14-9-5-12
- Cycle 32: 12-3-11-6-12

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <1, (8, 13), 11>
- <3, (9, 14), 12>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [30].
