Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 2) (18, 22) (18, 4) (22, 18) (22, 29) (22, 21) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 28) (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 20) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 7) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 17) (21, 3) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 12) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 28) (0, 21) (0, 16) (0, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 25) (14, 26) (26, 10) (26, 14) (26, 20) (26, 29) (26, 25) (2, 15) (2, 27) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 21) (12, 13) (28, 3) (28, 10) (28, 19) (28, 9) (8, 15) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 29) (7, 20) (29, 22) (29, 26) (29, 7) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 13) (1, 9) (20, 11) (20, 26) (20, 7) (23, 1) (23, 25) (25, 16) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 23) (9, 0) (9, 28) (9, 1) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 27) (24, 17) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 24) (27, 3) (27, 2) (27, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 2, 7, 3)
- Cycle 2: (18, 22, 21, 3, 15, 8, 18)
- Cycle 3: (21, 22, 29, 26, 20, 7, 2, 15, 21)
- Cycle 4: (21, 0, 16, 4, 18, 22, 21)
- Cycle 5: (21, 0, 9, 1, 25, 16, 0, 21)
- Cycle 6: (26, 10, 21, 22, 29, 26)
- Cycle 7: (26, 25, 1, 9, 28, 19, 5, 12, 26)
- Cycle 8: (27, 3, 15, 2, 7, 29, 26, 14, 27)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <3, 15, 2, 7> (chord: 15, 7)
- <18, 22, 21, 3> (chord: 18, 3)
- <21, 22, 29, 26> (chord: 21, 26)
- <21, 0, 16, 4> (chord: 0, 16)
- <21, 0, 9, 1> (chord: 0, 9)
- <26, 10, 21, 22> (chord: 10, 22)
- <26, 25, 1, 9> (chord: 25, 9)
- <27, 3, 15, 2> (chord: 3, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
