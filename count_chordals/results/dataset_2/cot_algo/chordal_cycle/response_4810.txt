Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 4) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (1, 0) (1, 17) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 14) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 16) (16, 12) (16, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (6, 18) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 2 - 9 - 17 - 1 - 0 
- Cycle 2: 0 - 2 - 9 - 18 - 6 - 0 
- Cycle 3: 0 - 2 - 9 - 17 - 1 - 4 - 0 
- Cycle 4: 0 - 2 - 4 - 10 - 15 - 14 - 0 
- Cycle 5: 0 - 2 - 18 - 9 - 17 - 1 - 0 
- Cycle 6: 0 - 2 - 4 - 12 - 16 - 7 - 14 - 0 
- Cycle 7: 0 - 4 - 12 - 16 - 7 - 14 - 0 
- Cycle 8: 0 - 4 - 12 - 19 - 3 - 14 - 0 
- Cycle 9: 0 - 14 - 3 - 19 - 12 - 4 - 0 
- Cycle 10: 0 - 14 - 7 - 11 - 10 - 4 - 0 

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 and Cycle 5 have one chord each. 
- Cycle 2, Cycle 3, and Cycle 10 have multiple chords. 
- Cycle 4, Cycle 6, Cycle 7, Cycle 8, and Cycle 9 have no chords. 

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of [2] unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 2, 9, 17, 1>
- <0, 2, 18, 9, 17, 1>
