Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 0, 5, 12)
- Cycle 2: (15, 12, 2, 16)
- Cycle 3: (14, 16, 2, 12)
- Cycle 4: (17, 14, 16, 2)
- Cycle 5: (10, 6, 16, 2)
- Cycle 6: (18, 17, 14, 16)
- Cycle 7: (7, 19, 5, 12)
- Cycle 8: (9, 12, 2, 16)
- Cycle 9: (4, 13, 3, 0)
- Cycle 10: (8, 9, 12, 2)
- Cycle 11: (1, 4, 13, 3)
- Cycle 12: (11, 13, 3, 0)
- Cycle 13: (7, 11, 13, 3)
- Cycle 14: (7, 17, 14, 16)
- Cycle 15: (7, 10, 18, 17)
- Cycle 16: (19, 5, 0, 9)
- Cycle 17: (6, 16, 14, 17)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <1, (3, 0), 5)> (Cycle 9 chords: 3-0)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <2, (15, 16), 12)> (Cycle 2 chords: 15-16)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <3, (14, 16), 2)> (Cycle 3 chords: 14-16)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <4, (17, 14), 16)> (Cycle 4 chords: 17-14)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <5, (10, 6), 16)> (Cycle 5 chords: 10-6)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <6, (18, 17), 14)> (Cycle 6 chords: 18-17)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <7, (7, 19), 5)> (Cycle 7 chords: 7-19)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <8, (9, 12), 2)> (Cycle 8 chords: 9-12)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <9, (1, 13), 3)> (Cycle 11 chords: 1-13)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <10, (11, 13), 3)> (Cycle 12 chords: 11-13)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <11, (7, 11), 13)> (Cycle 13 chords: 7-11)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <12, (7, 17), 14)> (Cycle 14 chords: 7-17)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <13, (7, 10), 18)> (Cycle 15 chords: 7-10)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <14, (19, 0), 9)> (Cycle 16 chords: 19-0)
- A chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <15, (6, 14), 16)> (Cycle 17 chords: 6-14)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

In this graph, there are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord as listed above.
