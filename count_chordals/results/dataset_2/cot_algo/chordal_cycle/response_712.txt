Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 4) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 19) (25, 16) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 29) (13, 20) (15, 20) (15, 22) (15, 17) (15, 2) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 6) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 28) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 5) (28, 4) (28, 22) (28, 12) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 0) (6, 20) (6, 21) (6, 17) (21, 13) (21, 6) (21, 26) (21, 14) (9, 8) (9, 22) (9, 29) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 28) (22, 9) (22, 24) (17, 15) (17, 5) (17, 6) (29, 13) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 27) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 23) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 14) (7, 27) (24, 22) (23, 26) (23, 7) (23, 12) (2, 25) (2, 15) (12, 28) (12, 23) (10, 3) (1, 25) (1, 29) (27, 3) (27, 29) (27, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 19) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 0) (14, 21) (14, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <16, 25, 1, 29>
- Cycle 2: <8, 13, 21, 6>
- Cycle 3: <15, 20, 6, 21>
- Cycle 4: <13, 5, 17, 6>
- Cycle 5: <4, 18, 5, 17>
- Cycle 6: <22, 28, 12, 23>
- Cycle 7: <7, 27, 3, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <16, 25, 1, 29> has a chord (25, 1)
- Cycle 2: <8, 13, 21, 6> has a chord (13, 6)
- Cycle 3: <15, 20, 6, 21> has a chord (20, 6)
- Cycle 4: <13, 5, 17, 6> has a chord (5, 17)
- Cycle 5: <4, 18, 5, 17> has a chord (18, 5)
- Cycle 6: <22, 28, 12, 23> has a chord (28, 12)
- Cycle 7: <7, 27, 3, 19> has a chord (27, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, all cycles have chords, so the number of chordless cycles is [0].
