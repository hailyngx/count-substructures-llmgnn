Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 
- There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph, including:
1. Cycle 1: 0-6-4-8-0
2. Cycle 2: 0-6-4-2-0
3. Cycle 3: 0-2-4-8-0
4. Cycle 4: 0-2-4-6-0
5. Cycle 5: 1-2-4-6-1
6. Cycle 6: 1-2-4-8-1
7. Cycle 7: 1-2-0-6-1
8. Cycle 8: 1-2-0-9-1
9. Cycle 9: 2-4-8-3-2
10. Cycle 10: 2-4-6-3-2
11. Cycle 11: 2-0-6-3-2
12. Cycle 12: 3-4-6-0-3
13. Cycle 13: 3-4-6-2-3
14. Cycle 14: 6-4-8-7-6
15. Cycle 15: 6-4-8-3-6
16. Cycle 16: 6-4-2-0-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 
- Among these cycles, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (2, 4), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1]. 

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <0, (2, 4), 8>, and the final count of chordless cycles is [1].
