Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 18) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 16) (17, 9) (17, 5) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 12) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 16) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (1, 10) (1, 16) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 9) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (19, 11) (19, 7) (13, 11) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3 - 15 - 9 - 17 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 2: 3 - 10 - 8 - 14 - 6 - 11 - 3
- Cycle 3: 3 - 10 - 1 - 16 - 14 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 4: 3 - 5 - 2 - 7 - 18 - 15 - 3
- Cycle 5: 14 - 0 - 11 - 13 - 6 - 14
- Cycle 6: 14 - 8 - 10 - 1 - 16 - 6 - 14
- Cycle 7: 14 - 16 - 1 - 10 - 8 - 14
- Cycle 8: 15 - 9 - 17 - 5 - 2 - 18 - 15
- Cycle 9: 18 - 7 - 2 - 5 - 17 - 9 - 18
- Cycle 10: 18 - 12 - 7 - 0 - 11 - 13 - 18
- Cycle 11: 5 - 17 - 9 - 8 - 10 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 12: 6 - 14 - 8 - 10 - 1 - 16 - 6
- Cycle 13: 7 - 2 - 5 - 17 - 9 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 14: 0 - 11 - 13 - 6 - 16 - 1 - 0

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 15-5
- Cycle 2 has a chord 10-14
- Cycle 3 has a chord 10-8
- Cycle 4 has a chord 5-7
- Cycle 5 has a chord 11-13
- Cycle 6 has a chord 8-1
- Cycle 7 has a chord 16-14
- Cycle 8 has a chord 9-17
- Cycle 9 has a chord 7-2
- Cycle 10 has a chord 7-0
- Cycle 11 has a chord 9-8
- Cycle 12 has a chord 14-8
- Cycle 13 has a chord 2-5
- Cycle 14 has a chord 6-16

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
- The number of chordal 4-cycles is [14]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <3, 15, 9, 17>
2. <3, 10, 8, 14>
3. <3, 10, 1, 16>
4. <3, 5, 2, 7>
5. <14, 0, 11, 13>
6. <14, 8, 10, 1>
7. <14, 16, 1, 10>
8. <15, 9, 17, 5>
9. <18, 7, 2, 5>
10. <18, 12, 7, 0>
11. <5, 17, 9, 8>
12. <6, 14, 8, 10>
13. <7, 2, 5, 17>
14. <0, 11, 13, 6>
