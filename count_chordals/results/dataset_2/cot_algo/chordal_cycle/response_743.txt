- Cycle 24: <3, 6, 10, 12, 14>
- Cycle 25: <3, 13, 12, 14, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 3, 14, 7, 0> - Chord: (3-7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 3, 4, 9, 12> - Chord: (3-9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 3, 6, 10, 7> - Chord: (3-10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 3, 13, 12, 10> - Chord: (3-12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 3, 13, 7, 0> - Chord: (3-0)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, 2, 11, 9, 7> - Chord: (2-9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, 2, 11, 4, 0> - Chord: (2-4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, 8, 9, 11, 10> - Chord: (8-11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <3, 4, 0, 7, 10> - Chord: (4-7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <3, 4, 9, 11, 2> - Chord: (4-11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <3, 6, 2, 11, 9> - Chord: (6-11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <3, 13, 0, 7, 10> - Chord: (13-7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <10, 11, 2, 6, 3> - Chord: (11-6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <10, 11, 4, 0, 7> - Chord: (11-4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <10, 12, 9, 11, 2> - Chord: (12-11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <10, 12, 14, 8, 1> - Chord: (12-8)
