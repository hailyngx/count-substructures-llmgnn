This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 23) (21, 27) (21, 8) (21, 17) (0, 27) (0, 12) (0, 26) (27, 21) (27, 0) (27, 4) (20, 28) (28, 20) (28, 29) (28, 14) (28, 13) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 13) (29, 15) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 25) (5, 17) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 26) (6, 8) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 22) (3, 12) (4, 27) (17, 1) (17, 21) (17, 5) (17, 16) (9, 29) (9, 3) (9, 25) (9, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 22) (2, 10) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 7) (15, 29) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 13) (7, 22) (7, 14) (25, 5) (25, 9) (25, 23) (8, 21) (8, 5) (8, 6) (14, 28) (14, 22) (14, 7) (14, 24) (26, 0) (26, 6) (16, 17) (16, 15) (24, 14) (23, 1) (23, 15) (23, 25) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 19) (18, 15) (18, 12) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 18) (13, 28) (13, 29) (13, 3) (13, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<1, 17, 5, 10, 2>
<1, 17, 5, 8, 6>
<1, 27, 0, 12, 3>
<1, 17, 5, 25, 23>
<1, 27, 0, 12, 18>
<1, 27, 0, 26, 6>
<21, 17, 5, 8, 6>
<21, 27, 0, 12, 3>
<21, 17, 5, 25, 23>
<21, 27, 0, 12, 18>
<21, 27, 0, 26, 6>
<27, 0, 12, 3, 13>
<27, 0, 26, 6, 8>
<27, 4, 17, 5, 10>
<27, 4, 17, 5, 25>
<20, 28, 14, 7, 22>
<20, 28, 13, 29, 9>
<20, 28, 29, 15, 23>
<20, 28, 29, 15, 19>
<20, 28, 29, 13, 19>
<0, 27, 21, 8, 5>
<0, 27, 21, 17, 5>
<0, 27, 21, 17, 16>
<0, 26, 6, 25, 5>
<8, 21, 17, 5, 10>
<8, 21, 17, 16, 15>
<8, 5, 17, 16, 15>
<8, 5, 17, 1, 23>
<8, 5, 25, 23, 15>
<8, 5, 25, 9, 29>
<5, 17, 21, 27, 0>
<5, 17, 1, 23, 15>
<5, 17, 1, 2, 10>
<5, 10, 2, 22, 7>
<5, 10, 19, 15, 23>
<5, 25, 23, 15, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<1, 17, 5, 10, 2> (Chord: 2)
<1, 17, 5, 8, 6> (Chord: 6)
<1, 27, 0, 12, 3> (Chord: 12)
<1, 17, 5, 25, 23> (Chord: 25)
<1, 27, 0, 12, 18> (Chord: 12)
<1, 27, 0, 26, 6> (Chord: 26)
<21, 27, 0, 12, 3> (Chord: 3)
<21, 17, 5, 25, 23> (Chord: 25)
<21, 27, 0, 12, 18> (Chord: 12)
<21, 27, 0, 26, 6> (Chord: 26)
<27, 0, 12, 3, 13> (Chord: 13)
<27, 0, 26, 6, 8> (Chord: 8)
<27, 4, 17, 5, 10> (Chord: 10)
<27, 4, 17, 5, 25> (Chord: 25)
<20, 28, 29, 15, 23> (Chord: 15)
<20, 28, 29, 15, 19> (Chord: 15)
<20, 28, 29, 13, 19> (Chord: 19)
<0, 27, 21, 8, 5> (Chord: 21)
<0, 27, 21, 17, 16> (Chord: 17)
<8, 21, 17, 16, 15> (Chord: 16)
<8, 5, 25, 23, 15> (Chord: 23)
<8, 5, 25, 9, 29> (Chord: 9)
<5, 17, 21, 27, 0> (Chord: 27)
<5, 10, 2, 22, 7> (Chord: 22)
<5, 10, 19, 15, 23> (Chord: 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [24]
