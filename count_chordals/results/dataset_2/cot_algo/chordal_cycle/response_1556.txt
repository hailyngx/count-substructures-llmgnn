Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 21) (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 3) (27, 20) (27, 5) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 12) (9, 0) (9, 6) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 23) (22, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 23) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 25) (12, 6) (12, 20) (12, 13) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 29) (28, 3) (28, 8) (13, 12) (26, 18) (26, 25) (26, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 2) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 23) (3, 27) (3, 17) (3, 28) (3, 21) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 3) (21, 19) (8, 11) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 29) (23, 18) (23, 10) (23, 29) (23, 15) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 15) (1, 25) (1, 29) (1, 19) (2, 25) (20, 27) (20, 12) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 23) (15, 24) (5, 27) (5, 22) (5, 24) (19, 21) (19, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
1. Cycle: 0 - 27 - 5 - 24 - 15 - 0
2. Cycle: 4 - 14 - 15 - 23 - 29 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

For the first cycle:
- Cycle: 0 - 27 - 5 - 24 - 15 - 0
  Chord: 27 - 15

For the second cycle:
- Cycle: 4 - 14 - 15 - 23 - 29 - 4
  Chord: 14 - 23

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<0, 27, 5, 24> with chord (27, 15) and
<4, 14, 15, 23> with chord (14, 23).
