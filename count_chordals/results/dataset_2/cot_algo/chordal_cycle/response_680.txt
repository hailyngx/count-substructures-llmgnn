Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 1) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 8) (22, 19) (22, 11) (23, 9) (23, 27) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 16) (19, 27) (26, 14) (26, 19) (26, 13) (11, 22) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 0) (28, 5) (13, 17) (13, 26) (13, 7) (13, 6) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 18) (20, 10) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (21, 3) (21, 6) (21, 5) (10, 14) (10, 20) (10, 15) (10, 24) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 5) (9, 23) (9, 4) (29, 7) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 18) (24, 11) (24, 10) (24, 7) (24, 2) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 29) (7, 24) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (5, 28) (5, 21) (5, 15) (5, 4) (8, 3) (8, 20) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (25, 12) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 25) (18, 20) (18, 6) (2, 24) (2, 4) (27, 23) (27, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: <1, 17, 20, 8>, <1, 16, 15, 10>, <1, 12, 25, 14>, <3, 21, 5, 28>, <3, 0, 4, 9>, <11, 22, 19, 26>, <11, 24, 2, 4>, <13, 26, 19, 16>, <13, 7, 29, 24>, <17, 20, 18, 6>

Step 2:
- Checking <1, 17, 20, 8>: Chord (1, 20) found.
- Checking <1, 16, 15, 10>: Chord (1, 15) found.
- Checking <1, 12, 25, 14>: Chord (1, 25) found.
- Checking <3, 21, 5, 28>: Chord (3, 5) found.
- Checking <3, 0, 4, 9>: Chord (3, 4) found.
- Checking <11, 22, 19, 26>: Chord (11, 19) found.
- Checking <11, 24, 2, 4>: Chord (11, 2) found.
- Checking <13, 26, 19, 16>: Chord (13, 19) found.
- Checking <13, 7, 29, 24>: Chord (13, 29) found.
- Checking <17, 20, 18, 6>: Chord (17, 18) found.

Step 3:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [10].
