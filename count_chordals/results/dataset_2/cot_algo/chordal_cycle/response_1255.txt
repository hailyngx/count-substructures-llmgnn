Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 11, 3, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 2, 13, 8, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 0, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 7, 4, 11, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 3, 7, 4, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 1, 11, 4, 9)
- Cycle 8: (4, 10, 6, 0, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 7, 9, 3, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 11, 1, 5, 4)
- Cycle 11: (7, 3, 11, 1, 7)
- Cycle 12: (8, 13, 2, 1, 8)
- Cycle 13: (8, 11, 3, 6, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 6, 10, 4, 8)
- Cycle 15: (8, 12, 3, 11, 8)
- Cycle 16: (13, 0, 5, 1, 13)
- Cycle 17: (10, 4, 6, 8, 10)
- Cycle 18: (11, 12, 14, 8, 11)
- Cycle 19: (3, 6, 0, 12, 3)
- Cycle 20: (3, 11, 1, 5, 3)
- Cycle 21: (2, 13, 0, 5, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord (7, 4)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 11)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (0, 6)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (4, 11)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (7, 4)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (1, 11)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 11 has a chord (1, 11)
- Cycle 12 has a chord (13, 2)
- Cycle 13 has a chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 14 has a chord (6, 10)
- Cycle 15 has a chord (11, 12)
- Cycle 16 has a chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 17 has a chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 18 has a chord (12, 14)
- Cycle 19 has a chord (0, 12)
- Cycle 20 has a chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 21 has a chord (5, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 14 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [14].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (1, 11), 5), (7, 4)>
<2, (2, 8), 5), (13, 0)>
<3, (5, 1), 3), (3, 11)>
<4, (0, 6), 4), (5, 0)>
<5, (4, 11), 9), (9, 7)>
<6, (7, 4), 6), (4, 11)>
<7, (1, 11), 7), (9, 1)>
<8, (1, 5), 3), (3, 7)>
<9, (4, 8), 10), (8, 6)>
<10, (6, 10), 4), (4, 8)>
<11, (11, 12), 14), (8, 11)>
<12, (3, 6), 8), (8, 3)>
<13, (5, 13), 2), (2, 5)>
<14, (0, 12), 3), (3, 0)>
