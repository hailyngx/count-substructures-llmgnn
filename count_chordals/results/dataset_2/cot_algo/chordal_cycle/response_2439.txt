Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 3) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 4, 2, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 10, 3, 7, 5, 6)
- Cycle 3: (11, 14, 4, 0, 11)
- Cycle 4: (11, 2, 8, 12, 11)
- Cycle 5: (11, 2, 4, 14, 11)
- Cycle 6: (11, 12, 8, 14, 11)
- Cycle 7: (4, 9, 1, 14, 4)
- Cycle 8: (8, 2, 6, 10, 8)
- Cycle 9: (8, 2, 4, 14, 8)
- Cycle 10: (8, 0, 5, 7, 3, 8)
- Cycle 11: (8, 0, 11, 2, 8)
- Cycle 12: (8, 12, 3, 0, 8)
- Cycle 13: (7, 3, 12, 8, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 5, 0, 8, 7)
- Cycle 15: (2, 6, 10, 13, 2)
- Cycle 16: (2, 4, 9, 1, 2)
- Cycle 17: (2, 4, 14, 1, 2)
- Cycle 18: (2, 13, 10, 6, 2)
- Cycle 19: (2, 14, 4, 0, 2)
- Cycle 20: (5, 7, 3, 10, 13, 5)
- Cycle 21: (5, 0, 4, 14, 5)
- Cycle 22: (14, 11, 2, 13, 14)
- Cycle 23: (14, 4, 2, 6, 14)
- Cycle 24: (14, 4, 0, 5, 14)
- Cycle 25: (3, 10, 6, 2, 3)
- Cycle 26: (3, 12, 11, 0, 3)
- Cycle 27: (7, 3, 5, 0, 7)
- Cycle 28: (0, 11, 12, 8, 0)
- Cycle 29: (0, 5, 7, 3, 0)
- Cycle 30: (13, 9, 1, 14, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (13, 2), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, (0, 6), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <7, (12, 3), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <11, (8, 2), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 30 cycles in total, and 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [4].
