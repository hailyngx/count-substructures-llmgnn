The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 14) (15, 13) (15, 12) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 8) (16, 10) (16, 17) (18, 9) (18, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (6, 0) (6, 8) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 7) (19, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 6) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 13) (13, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-14-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-2-1-14-9-5
- Cycle 3: 5-10-14-1-2-5
- Cycle 4: 5-7-1-14-9-5
- Cycle 5: 5-9-12-15-13-4-11-3-5
- Cycle 6: 5-9-12-8-6-0-7-1-14-5
- Cycle 7: 5-9-18-8-12-15-13-4-11-5
- Cycle 8: 5-7-0-6-8-18-9-14-1-5
- Cycle 9: 5-10-16-17-5
- Cycle 10: 1-14-3-11-4-13-15-12-8-1
- Cycle 11: 0-1-14-9-18-8-6-0
- Cycle 12: 4-11-3-14-1-2-5-10-16-17-4
- Cycle 13: 4-13-15-12-8-18-9-14-1-7-0-6-4
- Cycle 14: 4-19-11-3-14-1-7-0-19-4
- Cycle 15: 3-11-4-13-15-12-8-6-0-19-7-1-14-3
- Cycle 16: 3-14-9-18-8-12-15-13-4-19-7-1-2-5-10-16-3

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1, <5, 14, 9>: 5-9-14-1-5 (Chord: 9-14)
- Cycle 2, <5, 2, 1>: 5-2-1-14-9-5 (Chord: 2-1)
- Cycle 3, <5, 10, 16>: 5-10-14-1-2-5 (Chord: 10-16)
- Cycle 4, <5, 7, 1>: 5-7-1-14-9-5 (Chord: 7-1)
- Cycle 5, <5, 9, 13>: 5-9-12-15-13-4-11-3-5 (Chord: 9-13)
- Cycle 6, <5, 9, 12>: 5-9-12-8-6-0-7-1-14-5 (Chord: 9-12)
- Cycle 7, <9, 14, 5>: 5-9-14-1-2-5 (Chord: 14-5)
- Cycle 8, <5, 12, 15>: 5-9-12-15-13-4-11-3-5 (Chord: 12-15)
- Cycle 9, <5, 7, 1>: 5-7-1-14-9-5 (Chord: 7-1)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph: [9]
