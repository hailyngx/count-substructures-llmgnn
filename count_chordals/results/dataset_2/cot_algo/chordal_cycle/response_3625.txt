        - Cycle 6: (7, 3, 8, 5, 7)
        - Cycle 7: (7, 3, 5, 6, 7)
        - Cycle 8: (7, 6, 5, 13, 7)
        - Cycle 9: (7, 6, 10, 4, 7)
        - Cycle 10: (7, 6, 11, 4, 7)
        - Cycle 11: (10, 1, 7, 4, 10)
        - Cycle 12: (10, 5, 6, 7, 10)
        - Cycle 13: (10, 5, 13, 7, 10)

        - Cycle 15: (10, 6, 7, 4, 10)
        - Cycle 16: (11, 6, 7, 4, 11)
        - Cycle 17: (11, 6, 5, 13, 11)
        - Cycle 18: (11, 9, 0, 7, 11)
        - Cycle 19: (11, 9, 2, 4, 11)
        - Cycle 20: (8, 3, 5, 12, 8)
        - Cycle 21: (5, 6, 4, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 22: (5, 6, 7, 13, 5)
        - Cycle 23: (5, 7, 4, 10, 5)
        - Cycle 24: (5, 7, 13, 12, 5)
        - Cycle 25: (6, 4, 11, 2, 6)
        - Cycle 26: (6, 7, 13, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 27: (6, 10, 1, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 28: (6, 10, 5, 13, 6)
        - Cycle 29: (6, 11, 2, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 30: (0, 7, 4, 10, 0)
        - Cycle 31: (0, 7, 13, 12, 0)
        - Cycle 32: (0, 9, 2, 11, 0)
        - Cycle 33: (0, 9, 4, 10, 0)
        - Cycle 34: (14, 12, 5, 7, 14)
        - Cycle 35: (14, 12, 2, 11, 14)
        - Cycle 36: (14, 1, 10, 5, 14)
        - Cycle 37: (14, 1, 7, 0, 14)

        Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <4, (10, 6), 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (10, 1), 7>
      
        Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are [35] chordless cycles in the given graph.
