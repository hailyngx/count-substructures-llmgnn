Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 22) (15, 5) (27, 15) (27, 8) (8, 27) (8, 23) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 11) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 6) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 6) (26, 17) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 17) (0, 28) (7, 3) (7, 5) (24, 26) (24, 4) (24, 22) (9, 29) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 21) (29, 9) (29, 19) (29, 12) (29, 21) (29, 18) (14, 26) (14, 3) (14, 20) (1, 11) (1, 25) (6, 23) (6, 26) (6, 10) (17, 26) (17, 28) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 22) (18, 9) (18, 29) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 23) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 18) (3, 10) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 22) (19, 29) (19, 25) (20, 14) (2, 9) (2, 21) (10, 6) (10, 3) (12, 29) (12, 18) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 22) (22, 15) (22, 24) (22, 25) (22, 11) (22, 16) (4, 13) (4, 24) (21, 9) (21, 29) (21, 2) (21, 5) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (15, 27, 8, 23, 15)
- Cycle 2: (26, 28, 17, 26)
- Cycle 3: (9, 29, 18, 3, 9)
- Cycle 4: (13, 16, 22, 11, 13)
- Cycle 5: (4, 24, 22, 11, 4)
- Cycle 6: (14, 26, 17, 28, 14)
- Cycle 7: (1, 11, 22, 25, 1)
- Cycle 8: (6, 23, 3, 14, 6)
- Cycle 9: (21, 29, 18, 9, 21)
- Cycle 10: (5, 15, 23, 6, 5)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (15, 8)
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle: <26, 28, (17), 26>
- Cycle 3 has one chord (29, 18)
- Cycle 4 has one chord (16, 22)
- Cycle 5 has one chord (4, 24)
- Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle: <14, 26, (17), 28>
- Cycle 7 has one chord (11, 25)
- Cycle 8 has one chord (3, 14)
- Cycle 9 is a chordal 4-cycle: <9, 29, (18), 21>
- Cycle 10 has one chord (15, 23)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 3 chordless cycles: Cycle 2, Cycle 6, and Cycle 9

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3]. The unique chordal 4-cycles found are <26, 28, (17), 26>, <14, 26, (17), 28>, and <9, 29, (18), 21>.
