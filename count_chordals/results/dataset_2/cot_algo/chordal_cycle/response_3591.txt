Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 29) (13, 7) (22, 13) (9, 26) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 2) (26, 3) (26, 0) (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 11) (17, 7) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 21) (21, 7) (0, 26) (0, 25) (0, 24) (25, 0) (25, 6) (25, 19) (25, 2) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 15) (12, 1) (27, 14) (27, 12) (27, 1) (27, 6) (2, 26) (2, 25) (8, 19) (8, 20) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 16) (5, 23) (5, 11) (5, 24) (16, 19) (16, 15) (16, 6) (11, 17) (11, 5) (18, 10) (18, 3) (18, 29) (1, 12) (1, 27) (1, 29) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 1) (29, 23) (29, 15) (3, 26) (3, 18) (23, 9) (23, 5) (23, 29) (6, 25) (6, 27) (6, 16) (6, 10) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 28) (24, 0) (24, 5) (24, 28) (20, 14) (20, 8) (20, 4) (28, 10) (28, 24) (28, 4) (4, 20) (4, 28) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (13, 22, 13), length 3
- Cycle 2: (13, 12, 27, 14, 17, 11, 5, 23, 9, 26, 2, 25, 19, 8, 20, 14), length 16
- Cycle 3: (13, 12, 1, 27, 6, 25, 0, 26, 9, 19, 25, 6, 16, 15, 29, 1), length 16
- Cycle 4: (22, 13, 7, 17, 11, 5, 23, 9, 26, 0, 25, 2, 26), length 13
- Cycle 5: (9, 26, 3, 18, 29, 1, 12, 27, 14, 17, 7), length 11
- Cycle 6: (14, 17, 7, 21, 7, 13, 29, 1, 27, 6, 25), length 11
- Cycle 7: (17, 11, 5, 23, 29, 1, 12, 15, 27, 6), length 10
- Cycle 8: (7, 17, 11, 5, 24, 0, 25, 19, 16, 29), length 10
- Cycle 9: (21, 7, 17, 14, 27, 1, 29, 23, 5), length 9
- Cycle 10: (0, 26, 2, 25, 19, 8, 20, 4, 28), length 9
- Cycle 11: (25, 19, 8, 20, 14, 27, 1, 29, 15), length 9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Only Cycle 9 has exactly one chord (7, 14).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There is 1 chordless 4-cycle found in the graph: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found with one chord (7, 14): <7, 14, 17, 11>
