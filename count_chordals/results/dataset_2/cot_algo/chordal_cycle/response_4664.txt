Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-6-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-7-6-4-5
- Cycle 3: 7-1-6-4-7
- Cycle 4: 4-0-13-3-4
- Cycle 5: 6-1-7-5-6
- Cycle 6: 11-0-4-6-11
- Cycle 7: 14-0-13-3-14
- Cycle 8: 2-4-6-7-2
- Cycle 9: 8-10-2-12-8
- Cycle 10: 10-3-13-8-10

Step 2:

The cycles with exactly one chord (a non-adjacent edge in the cycle) are:
<5, (1, 6), 4>
<5, (7, 4), 6>
<7, (1, 6), 4>
<4, (0, 13), 3>
<6, (1, 7), 5>
<11, (0, 6), 4>
<14, (0, 13), 3>
<2, (4, 7), 6>
<8, (10, 2), 12>
<10, (3, 13), 8>

Step 3: 

The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].
