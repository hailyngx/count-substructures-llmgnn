Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-1-5-0
- Cycle 2: 1-5-2-7-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-2-7-1
- Cycle 4: 2-1-5-2
- Cycle 5: 2-5-4-7-2
- Cycle 6: 3-1-5-2-3
- Cycle 7: 4-0-2-5-4
- Cycle 8: 6-2-5-1-6
- Cycle 9: 7-2-5-1-7
- Cycle 10: 7-2-6-1-7
- Cycle 11: 8-3-7-2-8
- Cycle 12: 8-6-7-2-8
- Cycle 13: 9-0-4-7-9

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal Cycle 1: Cycle 9 with chord (6, 1)
- Chordal Cycle 2: Cycle 10 with chord (2, 6)
- Chordal Cycle 3: Cycle 11 with chord (7, 2)
- Chordal Cycle 4: Cycle 12 with chord (7, 2)
- Chordal Cycle 5: Cycle 13 with chord (4, 7)

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (6, 1), 7>
- <1, (2, 6), 7>
- <2, (7, 2), 8>
- <2, (7, 2), 8>
- <4, (7, 4), 9>
