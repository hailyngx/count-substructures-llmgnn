Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-3-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-6-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-6-14-8-0
- Cycle 4: 0-7-13-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (3, 5) => <1, (3, 5)>
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (8, 14) => <2, (8, 14)>
- Cycle 4 is not a 4-cycle

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are <1, (3, 5)> and <2, (8, 14)>.
