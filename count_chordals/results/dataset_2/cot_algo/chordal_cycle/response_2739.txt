Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 21) (23, 5) (23, 17) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 27) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 25) (16, 0) (16, 14) (28, 9) (18, 26) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 21) (21, 10) (21, 11) (21, 18) (21, 0) (21, 19) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (3, 4) (24, 18) (24, 17) (24, 15) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (29, 27) (29, 19) (5, 23) (5, 2) (5, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (20, 18) (27, 22) (27, 29) (27, 17) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 1) (12, 0) (12, 25) (12, 9) (19, 21) (19, 0) (19, 29) (19, 25) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 28) (9, 7) (9, 12) (25, 26) (25, 12) (25, 19) (17, 23) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 17) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (10, 11, 21, 10) 
- Cycle 2: (26, 11, 21, 26) 
- Cycle 3: (26, 22, 14, 16, 26) 
- Cycle 4: (26, 22, 14, 1, 13, 26) 
- Cycle 5: (26, 22, 14, 1, 13, 0, 26) 
- Cycle 6: (26, 22, 14, 1, 13, 0, 21, 26) 
- Cycle 7: (26, 22, 14, 1, 13, 0, 21, 18, 26) 
- Cycle 8: (26, 22, 14, 1, 13, 0, 21, 18, 24, 26)
- Cycle 9: (26, 22, 14, 1, 13, 0, 21, 18, 24, 17, 26) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (11, 21)
- Cycle 2 has chord (11, 21)
- Cycle 3 has chord (14, 16)
- Cycle 4 has chord (14, 1)
- Cycle 5 has chord (14, 1)
- Cycle 6 has chord (14, 1)
- Cycle 7 has chord (14, 1)
- Cycle 8 has chord (14, 1)
- Cycle 9 has chord (14, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord in the given graph. Therefore, the final count is [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <10, 11, 21, 10> (Chord: (11, 21))
- <26, 11, 21, 26> (Chord: (11, 21))
- <26, 22, 14, 16, 26> (Chord: (14, 16))
- <26, 22, 14, 1, 13, 26> (Chord: (14, 1))
- <26, 22, 14, 1, 13, 0, 26> (Chord: (14, 1))
- <26, 22, 14, 1, 13, 0, 21, 26> (Chord: (14, 1))
- <26, 22, 14, 1, 13, 0, 21, 18, 26> (Chord: (14, 1))
- <26, 22, 14, 1, 13, 0, 21, 18, 24, 26> (Chord: (14, 1))
- <26, 22, 14, 1, 13, 0, 21, 18, 24, 17, 26> (Chord: (14, 1))
