Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-7-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-9-2-1
- Cycle 3: 2-5-7-6-2
- Cycle 4: 3-9-2-1-3
- Cycle 5: 4-6-8-5-4
- Cycle 6: 4-7-5-1-4
- Cycle 7: 5-7-6-1-5
- Cycle 8: 6-7-5-1-6
- Cycle 9: 6-8-7-5-6
- Cycle 10: 7-5-1-6-7
- Cycle 11: 7-8-6-1-7
- Cycle 12: 8-5-7-6-8
- Cycle 13: 9-2-1-5-9

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (6, 7), 5>
- <1, (9, 2), 3>
- <2, (5, 6), 7>
- <3, (1, 9), 2>
- <4, (5, 1), 6>
- <5, (7, 6), 1>
- <6, (5, 1), 7>
- <7, (5, 6), 1>
- <8, (6, 7), 5>
- <9, (7, 6), 5>
- <10, (1, 7), 6>
- <11, (6, 1), 7>
- <12, (5, 7), 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]
