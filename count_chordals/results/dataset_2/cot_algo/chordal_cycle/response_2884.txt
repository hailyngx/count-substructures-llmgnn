Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 3 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 2: 4 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 4: 4 - 1 - 6 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 5: 4 - 6 - 8 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 6: 4 - 6 - 5 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 7: 7 - 8 - 6 - 5 - 7
- Cycle 8: 7 - 8 - 9 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 9: 7 - 3 - 1 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 10: 7 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 11: 7 - 5 - 6 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 12: 1 - 2 - 3 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 13: 1 - 2 - 9 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 14: 1 - 6 - 5 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 15: 3 - 2 - 9 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 16: 6 - 5 - 0 - 9 - 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (8, 9)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (5, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <4, 1, 3, 7> with one chord (1, 3)
2. <4, 7, 8, 9> with one chord (8, 9)
3. <4, 1, 3, 6> with one chord (1, 3)
4. <4, 1, 5, 6> with one chord (1, 5)
5. <4, 6, 8, 9> with one chord (6, 8)
6. <4, 5, 6, 0> with one chord (5, 6)
