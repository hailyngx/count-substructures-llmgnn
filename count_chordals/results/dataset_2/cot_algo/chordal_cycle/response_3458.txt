Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- 5-9-4-7-5
- 5-1-3-8-5
- 5-4-7-2-5
- 5-3-6-2-5
- 9-4-7-2-9
- 4-7-8-3-4
- 7-5-1-8-7
- 6-3-8-0-6

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <5, 9, 4, 7>
- <5, 1, 3, 8>
- <5, 4, 7, 2>
- <5, 3, 6, 2>
- <9, 4, 7, 2>
- <4, 7, 8, 3>
- <7, 5, 1, 8>
- <6, 3, 8, 0>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are no chordless cycles in this graph, so the final count is [0].
