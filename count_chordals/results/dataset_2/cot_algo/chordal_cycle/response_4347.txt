Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 1, 14, 2, 5)
- (5, 1, 11, 2, 5)
- (5, 11, 2, 14, 5)
- (5, 3, 12, 8, 5)
- (8, 4, 10, 13, 8)
- (9, 1, 14, 2, 9)
- (9, 10, 4, 0, 9)
- (13, 12, 3, 4, 13)
- (0, 5, 1, 9, 0)
- (0, 5, 3, 4, 0)
- (0, 9, 10, 4, 0)
- (0, 9, 13, 12, 0)
- (0, 4, 3, 12, 0)
- (0, 14, 2, 11, 0)
- (8, 1, 5, 11, 8)
- (8, 1, 14, 0, 8)
- (8, 12, 3, 4, 8)
- (13, 9, 1, 5, 13)
- (13, 9, 10, 12, 13)
- (13, 8, 1, 5, 13)
- (4, 8, 1, 5, 4)
- (4, 0, 5, 3, 4)
- (4, 0, 9, 10, 4)
- (4, 10, 12, 8, 4)
- (0, 6, 3, 12, 0)
- (0, 6, 8, 1, 0)
- (0, 12, 3, 4, 0)
- (14, 1, 5, 11, 14)
- (14, 1, 9, 0, 14)
- (14, 2, 11, 5, 14)
- (3, 12, 10, 4, 3)
- (11, 2, 6, 8, 11)
- (7, 14, 1, 5, 7)
- (6, 0, 5, 1, 6)
- (6, 0, 9, 10, 6)
- (6, 3, 12, 8, 6)
- (12, 3, 4, 10, 12)
- (10, 12, 3, 6, 10)
- (2, 14, 1, 5, 2)
- (2, 6, 8, 12, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 14), 2, 11>
- <5, (1, 11), 2, 14>
- <3, (5, 12), 4, 0>
- <4, (8, 10), 13, 9>
- <9, (13, 12), 0, 5>
- <0, (9, 4), 3, 12>
- <0, (5, 14), 1, 9>
- <8, (1, 11), 5, 13>
- <8, (12, 3), 4, 10>
- <13, (9, 10), 12, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final answer is [9].
