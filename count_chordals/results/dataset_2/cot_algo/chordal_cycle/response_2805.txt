The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 1) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 2: 4 - 9 - 13 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 7 - 11 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 4: 6 - 9 - 13 - 4 - 6
- Cycle 5: 6 - 4 - 7 - 11 - 6
- Cycle 6: 9 - 13 - 4 - 7 - 9
- Cycle 7: 10 - 6 - 4 - 3 - 10
- Cycle 8: 0 - 10 - 6 - 14 - 0
- Cycle 9: 0 - 11 - 7 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 10: 0 - 5 - 9 - 13 - 0
- Cycle 11: 0 - 3 - 4 - 13 - 0
- Cycle 12: 1 - 11 - 7 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 13: 1 - 12 - 8 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 14: 2 - 14 - 6 - 9 - 2
- Cycle 15: 2 - 3 - 4 - 13 - 2

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: {(6, 4)}
- Cycle 2 has a chord: {(9, 13)}
- Cycle 3 has a chord: {(7, 11)}
- Cycle 4 has a chord: {(9, 13)}
- Cycle 5 has a chord: {(4, 7)}
- Cycle 6 has a chord: {(9, 13)}
- Cycle 7 has a chord: {(4, 3)}
- Cycle 8 has a chord: {(6, 14)}
- Cycle 9 has a chord: {(7, 4)}
- Cycle 10 has a chord: {(5, 9)}
- Cycle 11 has a chord: {(4, 13)}
- Cycle 12 has a chord: {(7, 4)}
- Cycle 13 has a chord: {(8, 5)}
- Cycle 14 has a chord: {(6, 9)}
- Cycle 15 has a chord: {(4, 13)}

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [15]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (6, 4)>
<2, (9, 13)>
<3, (7, 11)>
<4, (4, 7)>
<7, (4, 3)>
<8, (6, 14)>
<9, (7, 4)>
<10, (5, 9)>
<11, (4, 13)>
<12, (7, 4)>
<13, (8, 5)>
<14, (6, 9)>
<15, (4, 13)>
