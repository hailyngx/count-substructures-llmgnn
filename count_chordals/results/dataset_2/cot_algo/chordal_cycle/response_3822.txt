Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 24) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 15) (26, 16) (26, 3) (5, 29) (5, 10) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 28) (17, 24) (17, 22) (4, 23) (4, 20) (18, 25) (18, 8) (13, 26) (13, 16) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 8) (7, 0) (7, 16) (16, 26) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 29) (1, 14) (1, 25) (1, 23) (6, 10) (11, 2) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 28) (8, 24) (28, 14) (28, 17) (28, 8) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 22) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 10) (3, 26) (3, 17) (3, 27) (3, 23) (29, 5) (29, 16) (29, 12) (24, 9) (24, 17) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 21) (25, 18) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 19) (22, 17) (22, 15) (22, 21) (12, 29) (12, 24) (12, 21) (2, 11) (2, 25) (2, 20) (23, 4) (23, 1) (23, 3) (23, 25) (20, 4) (20, 2) (27, 3) (21, 24) (21, 22) (21, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        1. Cycle: <0, 7, 16, 26, 13>
        2. Cycle: <1, 14, 17, 28, 8>
        3. Cycle: <2, 11, 25, 1, 14>
        4. Cycle: <3, 17, 14, 1, 25>
        5. Cycle: <4, 23, 25, 18, 8>
        6. Cycle: <5, 29, 16, 26, 13>
        7. Cycle: <6, 10, 19, 9, 24>
        8. Cycle: <8, 18, 25, 1, 14>
        9. Cycle: <8, 28, 17, 14, 1>
        10. Cycle: <10, 5, 29, 16, 26>
        11. Cycle: <12, 21, 24, 9, 26>
        12. Cycle: <12, 21, 22, 17, 14>
        13. Cycle: <12, 24, 8, 18, 25>
        14. Cycle: <13, 26, 16, 29, 5>
        15. Cycle: <15, 0, 7, 16, 26>
        16. Cycle: <15, 22, 17, 14, 1>
        17. Cycle: <15, 26, 16, 29, 5>
        18. Cycle: <17, 14, 1, 25, 23>
        19. Cycle: <17, 24, 8, 18, 25>
        20. Cycle: <19, 9, 26, 16, 29>
        21. Cycle: <21, 12, 24, 8, 18>
        22. Cycle: <21, 22, 17, 14, 1>
        23. Cycle: <22, 17, 14, 1, 25>
        24. Cycle: <23, 4, 20, 2, 11>
        25. Cycle: <23, 1, 14, 17, 22>
        26. Cycle: <23, 3, 26, 16, 29>
        27. Cycle: <24, 17, 14, 1, 25>
        28. Cycle: <24, 8, 28, 17, 14>
        29. Cycle: <24, 12, 21, 22, 17>
        30. Cycle: <25, 18, 8, 28, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - Only the following 4-cycles have exactly one chord:
        
        1. Cycle: <1, 14, 17, 28, 8> - Chord: (14, 28)
        2. Cycle: <3, 17, 14, 1, 25> - Chord: (14, 25)
        3. Cycle: <10, 5, 29, 16, 26> - Chord: (5, 16)
        4. Cycle: <17, 14, 1, 25, 23> - Chord: (14, 23)
        5. Cycle: <24, 17, 14, 1, 25> - Chord: (17, 25)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        
        Number of chordal 4-cycles: [25]

Thus, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, 14, 17, 28, 8>
<3, 17, 14, 1, 25>
<10, 5, 29, 16, 26>
<17, 14, 1, 25, 23>
<24, 17, 14, 1, 25>
