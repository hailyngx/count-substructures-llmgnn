Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-5-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-6-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-8-9-1
- Cycle 4: 1-4-8-7-1
- Cycle 5: 2-5-4-1-2
- Cycle 6: 2-5-4-8-2
- Cycle 7: 2-5-6-1-2
- Cycle 8: 2-5-6-4-2
- Cycle 9: 3-5-4-1-3
- Cycle 10: 3-5-4-6-3
- Cycle 11: 3-5-7-8-3
- Cycle 12: 3-5-7-0-3
- Cycle 13: 7-8-4-1-7
- Cycle 14: 7-8-4-5-7
- Cycle 15: 7-8-9-1-7
- Cycle 16: 7-8-9-4-7
- Cycle 17: 7-8-1-6-7
- Cycle 18: 7-8-1-4-7
- Cycle 19: 7-5-6-1-7
- Cycle 20: 7-5-6-4-7

Step 2: Identify the cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 6), 5>
- <2, (5, 4), 8>
- <3, (5, 4), 6>
- <4, (4, 8), 9>
- <5, (4, 8), 7>
- <6, (5, 6), 2>
- <7, (5, 6), 4>
- <8, (5, 3), 1>
- <9, (5, 3), 6>
- <10, (7, 8), 1>
- <11, (7, 8), 5>
- <12, (7, 5), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count would be [12].
