Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- 4-cycle: (5, 9, 6, 7)
- 4-cycle: (5, 3, 6, 2)
- 4-cycle: (5, 4, 7, 0)
- 4-cycle: (9, 6, 2, 4)
- 4-cycle: (9, 7, 0, 8)
- 4-cycle: (6, 7, 0, 8)
- 4-cycle: (6, 3, 4, 7)
- 4-cycle: (4, 7, 0, 8)
- 4-cycle: (2, 6, 9, 4)
- 4-cycle: (2, 4, 7, 0)
  
Step 2:
- <1, (2, 4), 5, 6, 9, 7>
- <2, (4, 7), 0, 8, 9, 6>
- <3, (4, 7), 0, 8, 9, 6>

Step 3:
As there are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [3].
