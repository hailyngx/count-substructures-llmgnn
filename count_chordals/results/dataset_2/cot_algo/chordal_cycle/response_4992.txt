Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Following the steps provided, let's find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

**Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:**
- (0, 2, 5, 6, 0)
- (0, 2, 8, 6, 0)
- (0, 3, 5, 2, 0)
- (0, 3, 2, 8, 0)
- (0, 3, 5, 6, 0)
- (1, 6, 5, 2, 1)
- (1, 6, 8, 2, 1)
- (1, 2, 8, 6, 1)
- (1, 2, 0, 3, 1)
- (1, 2, 5, 6, 1)
- (2, 5, 6, 8, 2)
- (3, 0, 2, 5, 3)
- (3, 0, 2, 8, 3)
- (3, 0, 2, 1, 3)
- (3, 0, 1, 9, 3)
- (3, 0, 7, 6, 3)
- (3, 2, 5, 6, 3)
- (3, 2, 8, 6, 3)
- (3, 2, 1, 6, 3)
- (4, 3, 0, 7, 4)
- (4, 3, 2, 8, 4)
- (5, 2, 8, 6, 5)
- (6, 1, 2, 5, 6)
- (6, 1, 9, 3, 6)
- (6, 1, 7, 0, 6)
- (6, 2, 8, 5, 6)
- (6, 5, 2, 8, 6)
- (7, 0, 3, 5, 7)
- (7, 0, 9, 1, 7)
- (7, 1, 6, 5, 7)
- (7, 1, 2, 8, 7)
- (8, 2, 0, 3, 8)
- (9, 1, 2, 5, 9)
- (9, 1, 6, 7, 9)

**Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:**
- <(0, 2, 5, 6, 0), (2, 6)>
- <(0, 3, 5, 2, 0), (3, 5)>
- <(0, 3, 5, 6, 0), (3, 6)>
- <(1, 6, 5, 2, 1), (1, 5)>
- <(1, 6, 8, 2, 1), (1, 8)>
- <(1, 2, 8, 6, 1), (2, 8)>
- <(3, 0, 2, 8, 3), (0, 8)>
- <(4, 3, 0, 7, 4), (3, 7)>
- <(5, 2, 8, 6, 5), (2, 6)>
- <(6, 1, 2, 5, 6), (1, 5)>
- <(7, 0, 3, 5, 7), (0, 5)>
- <(7, 0, 9, 1, 7), (0, 9)>

**Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found ([ ]):**
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. Therefore, the result is [12].
