Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (16, 19) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 17) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 4) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 8) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 7) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 14) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- 4-cycle: (3, 15, 9, 1)
- 4-cycle: (3, 15, 13, 7)
- 4-cycle: (1, 9, 12, 14)
- 4-cycle: (1, 17, 13, 7)
- 4-cycle: (15, 13, 7, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, 15, 9, 1>: Chord (1, 9)
- <3, 15, 13, 7>: Chord (13, 7)
- <1, 9, 12, 14>: Chord (9, 12)
- <1, 17, 13, 7>: Chord (17, 13)
- <15, 13, 7, 6>: Chord (13, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
