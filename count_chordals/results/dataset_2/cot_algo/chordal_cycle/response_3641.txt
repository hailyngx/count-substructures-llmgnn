Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (5, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. We will list them out:
- Cycle 1: 3-0-1-8-3
- Cycle 2: 3-0-13-4-3
- Cycle 3: 3-9-4-13-3
- Cycle 4: 3-9-11-0-3
- Cycle 5: 1-0-13-4-1
- Cycle 6: 1-0-3-8-1
- Cycle 7: 8-1-0-3-8
- Cycle 8: 9-11-8-6-9
- Cycle 9: 9-11-0-13-9
- Cycle 10: 9-14-13-4-9
- Cycle 11: 9-14-0-11-9
- Cycle 12: 9-14-13-10-9
- Cycle 13: 4-13-0-11-4
- Cycle 14: 4-13-10-1-4
- Cycle 15: 10-13-0-11-10

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 9: 9-11-0-13-9 has one chord 0-13.
- Cycle 11: 9-14-0-11-9 has one chord 0-11.
- Cycle 14: 4-13-10-1-4 has one chord 10-1.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
- <9, (0, 13), 11>
- <9, (0, 11), 14>
- <4, (10, 1), 13>
