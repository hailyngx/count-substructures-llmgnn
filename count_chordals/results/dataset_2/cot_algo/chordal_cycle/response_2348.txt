Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 1-2-7-4-1
- Cycle 2: 4-3-8-0-4
- Cycle 3: 4-13-5-10-4
- Cycle 4: 5-7-0-10-5
- Cycle 5: 13-9-10-0-13
- Cycle 6: 2-1-12-8-2

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, 4, (2, 7)> - Chord: 2-7
- Cycle 2: <3, 0, (8, 4)> - Chord: 8-0
- Cycle 3: <5, 10, (13, 4)> - Chord: 13-4
- Cycle 4: <7, 0, (10, 5)> - Chord: 10-0
- Cycle 5: <9, 10, (13, 0)> - Chord: 13-0
- Cycle 6: <1, 12, (2, 8)> - Chord: 2-8

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are a total of 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
