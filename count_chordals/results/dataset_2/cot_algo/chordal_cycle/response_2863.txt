Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 11) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 11) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 18) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 8) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 10) (15, 11) (13, 17) (13, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 7) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 4) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 1) (2, 12) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 0) (6, 4) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 11, 17, 13, 5)
- (9, 18, 0, 14, 9)
- (9, 12, 4, 6, 9)
- (17, 11, 15, 10, 17)
- (1, 14, 0, 3, 1)
- (1, 3, 18, 9, 1)
- (1, 3, 0, 8, 1)
- (3, 0, 8, 19, 3)
- (3, 18, 9, 12, 3)
- (0, 14, 1, 2, 0)
- (0, 3, 1, 2, 0)
- (0, 8, 3, 18, 0)
- (10, 15, 11, 5, 10)
- (10, 7, 13, 17, 10)
- (10, 19, 4, 12, 10)
- (15, 11, 17, 16, 15)
- (13, 17, 16, 8, 13)
- (8, 3, 1, 2, 8)
- (8, 0, 14, 1, 8)
- (8, 19, 4, 12, 8)
- (8, 16, 17, 11, 8)
- (19, 10, 7, 13, 19)
- (19, 4, 12, 9, 19)
- (4, 12, 9, 18, 4)
- (12, 2, 1, 14, 12)
- (7, 10, 15, 11, 7)
- (7, 13, 17, 16, 7)
- (7, 8, 3, 0, 7)
- (16, 17, 13, 7, 16)
- (2, 1, 14, 0, 2)
- (2, 12, 9, 18, 2)
- (18, 5, 11, 17, 18)
- (6, 4, 12, 2, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, (11, 17), 13)>
- <9, (0, 14), 18)>
- <9, (12, 4), 6)>
- <17, (15, 10), 11)>
- <1, (3, 18), 9)>
- <1, (3, 0), 8)>
- <3, (0, 8), 18)>
- <8, (3, 18), 9)>
- <8, (0, 14), 1)>
- <8, (19, 4), 12)>
- <8, (16, 17), 11)>
- <19, (10, 7), 13)>
- <19, (4, 12), 9)>
- <4, (12, 9), 18)>
- <12, (2, 1), 14)>
- <7, (10, 15), 11)>
- <7, (13, 17), 16)>
- <7, (3, 0), 8)>
- <16, (17, 13), 7)>
- <2, (1, 14), 0)>
- <2, (12, 9), 18)>
- <18, (5, 11), 17)>
- <6, (4, 12), 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [24].
