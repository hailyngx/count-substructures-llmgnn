- <3, (5, 19), 0)>
- <4, (19, 22), 12)>
- <5, (5, 28), 26)>
- <6, (15, 16), 3)>
- <7, (20, 25), 13)>
- <8, (9, 29), 11)>
- <9, (25, 13), 3)>
- <10, (17, 29), 11)>
- <11, (17, 25), 13)>
- <12, (17, 25), 12)>

- <15, (25, 13), 3)>
- <16, (29, 11), 2)>
- <17, (9, 29), 11)>
- <18, (9, 29), 11)>

- <34, (28, 0), 19)>
- <35, (26, 16), 3)>
- <36, (26, 8), 22)>
- <37, (4, 11), 29)>
- <38, (28, 0), 19)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 40 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [40].
