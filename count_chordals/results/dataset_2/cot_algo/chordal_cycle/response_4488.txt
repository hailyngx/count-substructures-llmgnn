Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 7, 1, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 4, 2, 6, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 3, 6, 0, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 7, 1, 2, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 2, 6, 3, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 1, 2, 6, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 9, 3, 8, 7)
- Cycle 10: (0, 6, 3, 8, 0)
- Cycle 11: (2, 4, 9, 1, 2)
- Cycle 12: (8, 0, 6, 2, 8)
- Cycle 13: (1, 7, 9, 5, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (2, 4), 5> (Cycle 11)
- <2, (6, 9), 5> (Cycle 4)
- <3, (0, 9), 6> (Cycle 5)
- <7, (1, 9), 5> (Cycle 1)
- <8, (3, 7), 9> (Cycle 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [8] 

Unique chordless 4-cycle:
<3, (0, 9), 6>
<7, (1, 9), 5>
