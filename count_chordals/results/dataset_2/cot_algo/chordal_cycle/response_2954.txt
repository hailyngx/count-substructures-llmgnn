Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 9) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 12) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (10, 2, 1, 11, 10)
- Cycle 2: (10, 14, 5, 8, 2, 10)
- Cycle 3: (11, 6, 7, 3, 13, 1, 11)
- Cycle 4: (4, 6, 7, 1, 2, 8, 4)
- Cycle 5: (6, 3, 7, 14, 12, 9, 13, 6)
- Cycle 6: (0, 7, 14, 5, 2, 1, 13, 9, 12, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (2, 11)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (10, 5)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (6, 11)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (1, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found, so the final answer is [0].
