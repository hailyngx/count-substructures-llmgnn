Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists - 
(5, 2, 1, 11), (5, 8, 9, 6), (9, 6, 3, 13), (6, 10, 0, 12), (1, 11, 4, 14), (3, 13, 7, 8), (10, 0, 11, 4), (8, 5, 1, 11), (13, 3, 6, 9), (4, 11, 1, 5), (7, 13, 8, 9), (12, 6, 9, 5), (2, 5, 8, 13), (0, 6, 9, 5), (14, 1, 5, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord - 
<5, 2, 1, 11>, <1, 11, 4, 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found -
