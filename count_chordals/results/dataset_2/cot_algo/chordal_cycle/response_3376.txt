Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 7) (5, 19) (5, 2) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 19) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 8) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 6) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 6) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 16) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 11) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: (1, 15, 9, 3, 4, 12, 7, 6, 17) 
- Cycle 2: (1, 15, 9, 16, 6, 7, 12, 4, 13) 
- Cycle 3: (1, 15, 9, 16, 0, 8, 14, 13, 4) 
- Cycle 4: (1, 15, 9, 16, 0, 8, 14, 18, 11) 
- Cycle 5: (1, 15, 9, 3, 4, 13, 14, 18, 11) 
- Cycle 6: (1, 15, 9, 3, 18, 14, 13, 4, 12) 
- Cycle 7: (1, 15, 9, 16, 0, 8, 14, 18, 3) 
- Cycle 8: (1, 14, 13, 4, 12, 7, 6, 16, 0) 
- Cycle 9: (1, 14, 13, 4, 7, 10, 2, 6, 16) 
- Cycle 10: (1, 14, 13, 4, 12, 7, 10, 2, 5)
- Cycle 11: (1, 8, 0, 16, 6, 7, 12, 4, 13) 

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 15, 9, 3>  (4, 12)  - Chord: (4, 12)
- <1, 15, 9, 16>  (6, 7)  - Chord: (6, 7)
- <1, 14, 13, 4>  (12, 7)  - Chord: (12, 7)
- <1, 14, 13, 4>  (7, 10)  - Chord: (7, 10)

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [7]
