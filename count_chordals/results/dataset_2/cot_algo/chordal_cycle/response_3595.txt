Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 18) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 15) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (2, 6) (2, 12) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 9) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) (17, 18) (17, 9) (17, 8) (12, 2) (12, 19) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 15) (9, 17) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 7) (8, 18) (8, 17) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 18, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 13, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 15, 4, 18, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 7, 13, 1, 3)
- Cycle 6: (5, 7, 13, 1, 5)
- Cycle 7: (6, 10, 19, 12, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 11, 15, 4, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 16, 14, 0, 6)
- Cycle 10: (4, 15, 11, 6, 4)
- Cycle 11: (18, 17, 9, 15, 18)
- Cycle 12: (18, 8, 17, 9, 18)
- Cycle 13: (0, 14, 16, 4, 0)
- Cycle 14: (14, 16, 6, 2, 14)
- Cycle 15: (2, 12, 19, 10, 2)
- Cycle 16: (15, 9, 14, 16, 15)
- Cycle 17: (13, 7, 5, 0, 13)
  
Step 2:
- Checking for chords:
  - <1, (4, 18), 3, 1> (Chord: (4, 18))
  - <1, (3, 7), 5, 1> (Chord: (3, 7))
  - <1, (13, 7), 3, 1> (Chord: (13, 7))
  - <1, (15, 4), 18, 1> (Chord: (15, 4))
  - <3, (7, 13), 1, 3> (Chord: (7, 13))
  - <5, (7, 13), 1, 5> (Chord: (7, 13))
  - <6, (10, 19), 12, 6> (Chord: (10, 19))
  - <6, (11, 15), 4, 6> (Chord: (11, 15))
  - <6, (14, 0), 16, 6> (Chord: (14, 0))
  - <4, (15, 11), 6, 4> (Chord: (15, 11))
  - <18, (9, 15), 17, 18> (Chord: (9, 15))
  - <18, (8, 17), 9, 18> (Chord: (8, 17))
  - <0, (16, 14), 4, 0> (Chord: (16, 14))
  - <14, (6, 2), 16, 14> (Chord: (6, 2))
  - <2, (19, 10), 12, 2> (Chord: (19, 10))
  - <15, (9, 14), 16, 15> (Chord: (9, 14))
  - <13, (5, 0), 7, 13> (Chord: (5, 0))

Step 3:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [17]
