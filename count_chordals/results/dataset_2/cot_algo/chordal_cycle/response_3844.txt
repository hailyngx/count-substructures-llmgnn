Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle <14, 17, 22, 9> with chord (19, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle <17, 5, 13, 16> with chord (1, 28)
- Chordal 4-cycle <22, 9, 19, 8> with chord (17, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 13, 16, 1> with chord (28, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle <13, 11, 7, 18> with chord (5, 3)
- Chordal 4-cycle <18, 26, 12, 14> with chord (23, 17)
- Chordal 4-cycle <26, 23, 0, 12> with chord (18, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle <29, 26, 23, 17> with chord (27, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle <8, 19, 4, 11> with chord (7, 18)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 5, 17, 14> with chord (8, 20)
- Chordal 4-cycle <27, 13, 5, 17> with chord (29, 26)
- Chordal 4-cycle <28, 2, 27, 13> with chord (16, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle <23, 26, 18, 11> with chord (0, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There were 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
