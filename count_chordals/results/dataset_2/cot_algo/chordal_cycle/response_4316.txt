Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (6, 1, 0, 6)
2. (9, 4, 0, 7)
3. (1, 3, 2, 1)
4. (3, 9, 4, 8)
5. (4, 8, 5, 7)
6. (8, 3, 1, 2)
7. (5, 7, 8, 5)
8. (0, 6, 5, 7)
9. (2, 1, 3, 2)
10. (9, 8, 5, 6)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <1, (0, 6), 6>
2. <9, (4, 0), 7>
3. <1, (3, 2), 1>
4. <8, (4, 9), 3>
5. <5, (7, 8), 7>
6. <3, (1, 2), 2>
7. <7, (5, 8), 5>
8. <0, (5, 6), 6>
9. <2, (1, 3), 3>
10. <6, (5, 8), 9>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
[0]
