Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (5, 9, 6, 1)
- (5, 9, 1, 3)
- (9, 6, 1, 3)
- (5, 9, 4, 7)
- (5, 4, 7, 9)
- (9, 4, 7, 5)
- (5, 4, 0, 6)
- (5, 3, 1, 6)
- (6, 0, 2, 4)
- (6, 0, 4, 7)
- (6, 3, 1, 9)
- (1, 3, 5, 7)
- (7, 9, 4, 2)

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 9, 1, 3> with chord (9, 1)

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [12]
