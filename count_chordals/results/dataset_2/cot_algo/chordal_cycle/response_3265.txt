Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (20, 18), 17>
2. <2, (0, 27), 29>
3. <3, (10, 27), 15>
4. <4, (0, 21), 18>
5. <6, (20, 22), 1>
6. <7, (14, 29), 17>
7. <10, (27, 29), 17>
8. <16, (9, 23), 28>
9. <23, (8, 14), 26>
10. <32, (11, 17), 2> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of chordal 4-cycles is [10].
