Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 0 (length 2)
- Cycle 2: 0 - 1 - 0 - 3 - 4 (length 4)
- Cycle 3: 0 - 3 - 4 - 6 - 8 (length 4)
- Cycle 4: 0 - 3 - 4 - 6 - 2 (length 4)
- Cycle 5: 0 - 3 - 4 - 8 - 7 (length 4)
- Cycle 6: 0 - 3 - 6 - 4 - 8 (length 4)
- Cycle 7: 0 - 7 - 9 - 6 - 4 (length 4)
- Cycle 8: 0 - 7 - 9 - 6 - 5 (length 4)
- Cycle 9: 0 - 7 - 9 - 6 - 8 (length 4)
- Cycle 10: 0 - 7 - 9 - 5 - 6 (length 4)
- Cycle 11: 0 - 7 - 8 - 6 - 4 (length 4)
- Cycle 12: 0 - 7 - 8 - 6 - 5 (length 4)
- Cycle 13: 1 - 0 - 3 - 4 - 6 (length 4)
- Cycle 14: 2 - 0 - 3 - 4 - 6 (length 4)
- Cycle 15: 2 - 0 - 7 - 8 - 6 (length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (0, 3), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (0, 7), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 13 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
