Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 -> 9 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 
- Cycle 2: 5 -> 9 -> 6 -> 4 -> 8 -> 5 
- Cycle 3: 9 -> 6 -> 4 -> 3 -> 9 
- Cycle 4: 6 -> 4 -> 8 -> 0 -> 6 
- Cycle 5: 4 -> 8 -> 3 -> 4 
- Cycle 6: 8 -> 0 -> 7 -> 5 -> 8 
- Cycle 7: 0 -> 7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 0 
- Cycle 8: 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> 7 

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has chord <9, 4>.
- Cycle 3 has chord <6, 3>.
- Cycle 4 has chord <4, 8>.
- Cycle 5 has chord <8, 3>.
- Cycle 6 has chord <0, 7>.
- Cycle 7 has chord <6, 2>.
- Cycle 8 has chord <5, 4>.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
Number of chordless cycles = 1 (Cycle 1)

Final Result: [1]
