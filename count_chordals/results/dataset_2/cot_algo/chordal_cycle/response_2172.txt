Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 16) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 10) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 15) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 17) (5, 17) (5, 15) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 5) (10, 9) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-6-8-4
- Cycle 2: 1-4-13-17-1
- Cycle 3: 1-8-15-5-1
- Cycle 4: 8-19-14-11-8
- Cycle 5: 14-17-5-15-14
- Cycle 6: 0-15-5-17-0
- Cycle 7: 2-4-13-17-2
- Cycle 8: 19-14-11-13-19
- Cycle 9: 16-3-16-12-19
- Cycle 10: 18-1-8-6-18

Step 2:
Only Cycle 1: 4-7-6-8-4 has exactly one chord which is the edge connecting vertices 6 and 8.

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, which is <4-7-6-8>.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
