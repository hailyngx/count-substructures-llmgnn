Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 18) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 12) (15, 6) (15, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 17) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 14) (14, 11) (14, 16) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 17) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 19) (5, 8) (5, 4) (17, 15) (17, 0) (17, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 8, 13, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 13, 16, 14, 11, 0, 4, 3, 8, 9, 6)
- Cycle 3: (10, 11, 19, 17, 15, 6, 1, 2, 13, 8, 3, 4, 0, 11, 14, 16, 2, 7, 18, 12, 10)
- Cycle 4: (18, 12, 10, 11, 14, 16, 2, 7, 18)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (8, 13), 6>
- Chordal cycle 2: <3, (4, 0), 6>
- Chordal cycle 3: <15, (17, 19), 6>
- Chordal cycle 4: Not a chordal cycle

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
