Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 7, 3>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 2, 4>
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 7, 5>
- Cycle 4: <1, 8, 2, 4>
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 3, 5>
- Cycle 6: <2, 8, 4, 9>
- Cycle 7: <3, 7, 5, 1>
- Cycle 8: <4, 8, 2, 1>
- Cycle 9: <5, 7, 6, 1>
- Cycle 10: <6, 8, 4, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- From Cycle 1: <0, 6, 7, 3> has chord (0, 7).
- From Cycle 2: <0, 8, 2, 4> has chord (0, 2).
- From Cycle 3: <1, 6, 7, 5> has chord (1, 7).
- From Cycle 4: <1, 8, 2, 4> has chord (1, 2).
- From Cycle 5: <1, 7, 3, 5> has chord (1, 3).
- From Cycle 6: <2, 8, 4, 9> has chord (2, 4).
- From Cycle 7: <3, 7, 5, 1> has chord (3, 5).
- From Cycle 8: <4, 8, 2, 1> has chord (4, 2).
- From Cycle 9: <5, 7, 6, 1> has chord (5, 6).
- From Cycle 10: <6, 8, 4, 9> has chord (6, 4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
