Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 23) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 18) (7, 14) (7, 21) (7, 29) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 9) (8, 24) (8, 0) (8, 18) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 15) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 27) (25, 20) (25, 9) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 4) (29, 7) (29, 19) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 15) (0, 6) (6, 21) (6, 0) (6, 3) (28, 16) (28, 24) (26, 4) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 27) (16, 2) (16, 28) (16, 24) (16, 22) (18, 17) (18, 8) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 24) (4, 2) (4, 26) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 23) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 27) (19, 29) (19, 22) (19, 9) (22, 16) (22, 19) (22, 11) (3, 17) (3, 6) (24, 8) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 15) (24, 23) (9, 21) (9, 25) (9, 19) (27, 20) (27, 1) (27, 5) (11, 13) (11, 22) (23, 14) (23, 12) (23, 24) (10, 14) (10, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

<0, (15, 1), (27, 5), 20>
<1, 15, (24, 16), 4>
<1, 4, (12, 23), 13>
<2, 17, (18, 8), 0>
<4, 2, (16, 24), 15>
<4, 12, (23, 24), 15>
<5, 4, (1, 27), 20>
<7, 21, (6, 0), 8>
<9, 19, (22, 16), 24>
<10, 5, (27, 20), 0>
<10, 14, (23, 12), 13>
<11, 22, (19, 9), 21>
<14, 7, (21, 6), 0>
<14, 10, (5, 27), 20>
<17, 3, (6, 0), 8>


Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

<0, (15, 1), (27, 5), 20> - Chord: (15, 1)
<1, 15, (24, 16), 4> - Chord: (24, 16)
<1, 4, (12, 23), 13> - Chord: (12, 23)
<2, 17, (18, 8), 0> - Chord: (18, 8)
<4, 2, (16, 24), 15> - Chord: (16, 24)
<4, 12, (23, 24), 15> - Chord: (23, 24)
<5, 4, (1, 27), 20> - Chord: (1, 27)
<7, 21, (6, 0), 8> - Chord: (6, 0)
<9, 19, (22, 16), 24> - Chord: (22, 16)
<10, 5, (27, 20), 0> - Chord: (27, 20)
<10, 14, (23, 12), 13> - Chord: (23, 12)
<11, 22, (19, 9), 21> - Chord: (19, 9)
<14, 7, (21, 6), 0> - Chord: (21, 6)
<14, 10, (5, 27), 20> - Chord: (5, 27)
<17, 3, (6, 0), 8> - Chord: (6, 0)


Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are a total of [14] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
