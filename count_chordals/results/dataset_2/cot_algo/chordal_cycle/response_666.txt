Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: 5-1-6-2-5
- Cycle 2: 9-5-1-9
- Cycle 3: 4-5-1-4
- Cycle 4: 4-3-9-5-4
- Cycle 5: 4-3-2-5-4
- Cycle 6: 4-6-2-5-4
- Cycle 7: 4-8-1-5-4
- Cycle 8: 0-1-5-4-0
- Cycle 9: 0-1-6-2-0
- Cycle 10: 0-2-6-5-0

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- <1, (6, 2), 5> has a chord 6-2
- <2, (1, 9), 5> has a chord 1-9
- <3, (4, 9), 5> has a chord 4-9
- <4, (2, 5), 3> has a chord 2-5
- <5, (3, 4), 9> has a chord 3-4
- <6, (5, 1), 4> has a chord 5-1
- <7, (1, 8), 5> has a chord 1-8
- <8, (4, 5), 0> has a chord 4-5
- <9, (0, 6), 2> has a chord 0-6
- <10, (2, 5), 0> has a chord 2-5

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal cycles found:
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [10].
