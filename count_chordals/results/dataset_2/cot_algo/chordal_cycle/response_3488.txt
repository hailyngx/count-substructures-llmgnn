Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (14, 10) (14, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-8-3-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-4-1-6
- Cycle 3: 6-11-8-3-6
- Cycle 4: 6-11-10-5-6
- Cycle 5: 1-6-3-2-1
- Cycle 6: 1-3-8-11-1
- Cycle 7: 3-6-1-4-3
- Cycle 8: 3-9-7-13-3
- Cycle 9: 10-11-8-14-10
- Cycle 10: 10-13-7-0-10
- Cycle 11: 10-5-2-7-10
- Cycle 12: 11-6-1-4-11
- Cycle 13: 11-8-14-10-11
- Cycle 14: 5-10-13-7-5
- Cycle 15: 13-7-0-12-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycle is:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, (9, 8), 3, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, (9, 4), 1, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, (11, 8), 3, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6, (11, 10), 5, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (6, 3), 2, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (4, 6), 3, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, (1, 8), 11, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <3, (9, 7), 13, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <10, (11, 8), 14, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (13, 7), 0, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <10, (5, 2), 7, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <11, (6, 1), 4, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <11, (8, 14), 10, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <5, (10, 13), 7, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <13, (7, 0), 12, 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 15 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
