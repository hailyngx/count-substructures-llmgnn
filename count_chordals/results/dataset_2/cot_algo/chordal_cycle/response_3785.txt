Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 11) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 2) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 16) (7, 16) (7, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 11) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 5) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 13) (4, 9) (4, 19) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 6) (12, 13) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 2) (13, 12) (5, 11) (8, 17) (8, 18) (10, 16) (10, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 15 - 1 - 16 - 19 - 15
- Cycle 2: 14 - 17 - 16 - 7 - 11 - 14
- Cycle 3: 17 - 16 - 19 - 10 - 17
- Cycle 4: 17 - 11 - 9 - 18 - 17
- Cycle 5: 0 - 13 - 18 - 9 - 11 - 0
- Cycle 6: 1 - 2 - 0 - 13 - 15 - 1
- Cycle 7: 16 - 7 - 11 - 5 - 16

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycles with exactly one chord:
    - Cycle 1: 15 - 1 - 16 - 19 - 15 (Chord: 1-19)
    - Cycle 2: 14 - 17 - 16 - 7 - 11 - 14 (Chord: 17-7)
    - Cycle 3: 17 - 16 - 19 - 10 - 17 (Chord: 16-10)
    - Cycle 4: 17 - 11 - 9 - 18 - 17 (Chord: 11-18)
    - Cycle 5: 0 - 13 - 18 - 9 - 11 - 0 (Chord: 13-9)
    - Cycle 6: 1 - 2 - 0 - 13 - 15 - 1 (Chord: 2-13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<15, (1, 19), 16>
<14, (17, 7), 16>
<17, (16, 10), 19>
<17, (11, 18), 9>
<0, (13, 9), 11>
<1, (2, 13), 15>
