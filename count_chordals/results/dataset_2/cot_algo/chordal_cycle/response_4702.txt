Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 23) (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 25) (14, 5) (17, 14) (3, 11) (3, 27) (3, 22) (25, 14) (25, 0) (25, 28) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 1) (27, 3) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 19) (10, 15) (10, 13) (28, 9) (28, 14) (28, 25) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 6) (29, 11) (6, 29) (6, 1) (6, 18) (2, 8) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 18) (22, 26) (22, 3) (22, 5) (24, 26) (24, 13) (11, 3) (11, 29) (11, 13) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 5) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 18) (5, 14) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 24) (13, 11) (13, 5) (0, 25) (0, 8) (16, 12) (16, 4) (19, 27) (19, 7) (19, 4) (23, 26) (23, 7) (23, 20) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 19) (20, 23) (20, 21) (21, 20) (18, 27) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

        Cycles of length 4:
        (1) 5-1-15-10-5

        Cycles of length 5:
        (1) 5-1-15-18-6-29-11-3-22-5
        (2) 13-11-3-27-19-4-16-12-1-13

        Cycles of length 6:
        (1) 13-11-29-6-1-15-13

        Cycles of length 7:
        (1) 13-11-29-6-18-15-1-12-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

        Unique Chordal 4-cycle found:
        <5, (1, 15)> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

        There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
