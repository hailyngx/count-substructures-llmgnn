Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 8, 2, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 4, 7)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 0, 7)
- Cycle 6: (9, 2, 5, 8)
- Cycle 7: (9, 0, 7, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 7, 1, 5)
- Cycle 9: (4, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 10: (4, 3, 0, 7)
- Cycle 11: (7, 0, 9, 5)
- Cycle 12: (8, 5, 1, 2)
- Cycle 13: (8, 2, 0, 9)
- Cycle 14: (2, 5, 1, 4)
- Cycle 15: (2, 1, 7, 4)
- Cycle 16: (2, 0, 3, 5)
- Cycle 17: (0, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 18: (0, 7, 4, 3)
- Cycle 19: (1, 5, 9, 0)
- Cycle 20: (1, 7, 4, 3)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 5), Chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 2: (5, 8, 2, 5), Chord: (8, 2)
- Cycle 3: (5, 1, 2, 5), Chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 4, 7), Chord: (7, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 0, 7), Chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 6: (8, 2, 5, 1), Chord: (2, 1)
- Cycle 7: (9, 0, 7, 4), Chord: (0, 7)
- Cycle 8: (4, 7, 1, 5), Chord: (7, 1)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [8] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 9, 2, 5, (9, 2)>
<5, 8, 2, 5, (8, 2)>
<5, 1, 2, 5, (1, 2)>
<5, 3, 4, 7, (7, 4)>
<5, 9, 0, 7, (9, 7)>
<8, 2, 5, 1, (2, 1)>
<9, 0, 7, 4, (0, 7)>
<4, 7, 1, 5, (7, 1)>
