Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 7) (11, 13) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 19) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 5) (9, 15) (1, 18) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 13) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 12) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 3) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 15) 

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 in the graph:

1. (2, 4, 8, 5)
2. (2, 4, 6, 1)
3. (2, 15, 5, 8)
4. (2, 15, 9, 13)
5. (2, 16, 12, 0)
6. (2, 3, 7, 11)
7. (2, 18, 0, 12)
8. (4, 6, 1, 18)
9. (4, 8, 10, 19)
10. (5, 8, 10, 19)
11. (7, 11, 13, 6)
12. (7, 5, 15, 9)
13. (7, 3, 0, 12)
14. (8, 5, 15, 9)
15. (12, 0, 17, 19)
16. (12, 16, 14, 2)
17. (18, 0, 17, 19)
18. (18, 1, 6, 13)
19. (19, 10, 8, 5)

Next, let's identify the cycles that have exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges) in each cycle:

1. <2, (4, 8), 5>
2. <2, (6, 1), 4>
3. <2, (15, 5), 8>
4. <2, (15, 9), 13>
5. <2, (16, 12), 0>
6. <2, (3, 7), 11>
7. <2, (18, 0), 12>
8. <4, (6, 1), 8>
9. <8, (10, 19), 5>  
10. <7, (11, 13), 6>
11. <7, (15, 9), 5>
12. <7, (0, 12), 3>
13. <8, (10, 19), 5>
14. <12, (0, 17), 19>
15. <12, (16, 14), 2>
16. <18, (0, 17), 19>
17. <18, (1, 6), 13>
18. <19, (10, 8), 5>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [18].
