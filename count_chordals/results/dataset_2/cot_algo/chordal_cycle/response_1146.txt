Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (3, 16) (3, 12) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 6) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 4) (13, 1) (13, 7) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 10) (15, 14) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 18) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 7) (18, 19) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (7, 13) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 4) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 2) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (14, 0, 12, 14)
- (14, 2, 17, 6)
- (11, 19, 18, 5)
- (8, 7, 13, 1)
- (1, 10, 8, 11)
- (16, 4, 10, 7)
- (7, 16, 3, 12)
- (17, 2, 1, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- (14, 0, 12, 14) has a chord (0, 12)
- (14, 2, 17, 6) has a chord (2, 17)
- (11, 19, 18, 5) has a chord (19, 18)
- (8, 7, 13, 1) has a chord (7, 13)
- (1, 10, 8, 11) has a chord (10, 8)
- (16, 4, 10, 7) has a chord (4, 10)
- (7, 16, 3, 12) has a chord (16, 3)
- (17, 2, 1, 13) has a chord (2, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are no chordless cycles in this graph, so the final count is [0].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <(14, 0), (12, 14)>
- <(14, 2), (17, 6)>
- <(11, 19), (18, 5)>
- <(8, 7), (13, 1)>
- <(1, 10), (8, 11)>
- <(16, 4), (10, 7)>
- <(7, 16), (3, 12)>
- <(17, 2), (1, 13)>
