Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 11) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 6-9-3-1-6
        - Cycle 2: 6-11-0-14-6
        - Cycle 3: 6-13-0-14-6
        - Cycle 4: 9-6-11-2-9
        - Cycle 5: 9-8-1-3-9
        - Cycle 6: 9-10-0-14-9
        - Cycle 7: 1-3-7-14-1
        - Cycle 8: 1-4-12-7-1
        - Cycle 9: 1-8-9-3-1
        - Cycle 10: 1-14-0-13-1
        - Cycle 11: 3-1-4-5-3
        - Cycle 12: 3-7-12-4-3
        - Cycle 13: 3-9-8-1-3
        - Cycle 14: 4-1-8-9-4
        - Cycle 15: 4-5-2-3-4
        - Cycle 16: 4-8-1-14-4
        - Cycle 17: 4-10-12-7-4
        - Cycle 18: 5-2-11-0-5
        - Cycle 19: 5-3-9-8-5
        - Cycle 20: 5-4-12-7-5
        - Cycle 21: 7-2-11-6-7
        - Cycle 22: 7-3-1-8-7
        - Cycle 23: 7-12-4-10-7
        - Cycle 24: 7-14-0-13-7
        - Cycle 25: 12-4-1-8-12
        - Cycle 26: 12-7-14-0-12
        - Cycle 27: 12-10-9-8-12
        - Cycle 28: 0-14-1-8-0
        - Cycle 29: 0-10-9-3-0
        - Cycle 30: 0-11-6-13-0

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        From the cycles listed above, the following chordal 4-cycles are found:
        <1, (3, 14), 7)>
        <2, (3, 11), 5)>
        <4, (1, 14), 7)>
        <12, (4, 7), 10)>
        <0, (10, 13), 14)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final answer is [5].
