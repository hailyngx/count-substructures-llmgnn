Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 6) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (10, 4) (10, 12) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 9, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 12, 6, 4)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 2, 5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 12, 7, 4, 10, 12, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 12, 6, 0, 11, 4, 10, 12, 1)
- Cycle 6: (2, 5, 13, 3, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 8, 11, 4, 10, 12, 6, 2)
- Cycle 8: (4, 10, 0, 11, 8, 7, 4)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (4, 9) forming a chordal 4-cycle: <1, (4, 9), 5>
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord (5, 13) forming a chordal 4-cycle: <2, (5, 13), 3>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is 2.
Putting it inside brackets, we get the final answer as [2].
