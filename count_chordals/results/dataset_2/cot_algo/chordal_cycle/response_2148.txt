Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-5-7-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-6-7-1
- Cycle 3: 1-2-3-6-1

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 3.
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, 4, 7, 1>
- <1, 3, 6, 7, 1>
- <1, 2, 3, 6, 1>
