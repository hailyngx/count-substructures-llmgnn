Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 0-8-2-4-5-13-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-8-2-1-7-12-9-0
        - Cycle 3: 1-2-4-5-13-3-1
        - Cycle 4: 3-13-9-10-6-5-4-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: 0-8-2-4-5-13-0 has no chord.
        - Cycle 2: 0-8-2-1-7-12-9-0 has no chord.
        - Cycle 3: 1-2-4-5-13-3-1 has one chord: (2, 3).
        - Cycle 4: 3-13-9-10-6-5-4-3 has one chord: (9, 6).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are [2] chordal 4-cycles found.

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
        <1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 3> with one chord (2, 3).
        <3, 13, 9, 10, 6, 5, 4, 3> with one chord (9, 6).
