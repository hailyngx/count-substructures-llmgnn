Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: 1-9-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-9-7-1
- Cycle 3: 1-9-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-5-1
- Cycle 5: 1-3-4-1
- Cycle 6: 1-3-8-1
- Cycle 7: 1-6-9-1
- Cycle 8: 1-6-8-1
- Cycle 9: 1-6-0-1
- Cycle 10: 1-0-5-1
- Cycle 11: 1-0-6-1
- Cycle 12: 1-7-9-1
- Cycle 13: 1-7-8-1
- Cycle 14: 1-2-8-1
- Cycle 15: 3-5-9-3
- Cycle 16: 3-5-1-3
- Cycle 17: 3-5-8-3

Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:

- Cycle 1 has chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 2 has chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 3 has chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 4 has chord (3, 5)
- Cycle 5 does not have a chord
- Cycle 6 does not have a chord
- Cycle 7 has chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 8 has chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 9 has chord (6, 0)
- Cycle 10 has chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 11 has chord (0, 6)
- Cycle 12 has chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 13 has chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 14 has chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 15 has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 16 has chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 17 does not have a chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are a total of [10] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (9, 6), 6, 9>
- <1, (9, 7), 7, 9>
- <1, (9, 5), 5, 1>
- <1, 3, 5, 1>
- <1, 3, 4, 1>
- <1, 3, 8, 1>
- <1, (6, 9), 9, 1>
- <1, (6, 8), 8, 1>
- <1, (6, 0), 0, 1>
- <1, 0, 5, 1>
