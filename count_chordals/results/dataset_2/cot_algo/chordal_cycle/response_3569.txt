Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 15) (12, 21) (12, 29) (12, 6) (27, 28) (27, 17) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 5) (18, 20) (17, 10) (17, 27) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 6) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 26) (21, 12) (21, 20) (28, 27) (28, 9) (28, 22) (1, 29) (1, 19) (26, 14) (26, 23) (26, 20) (7, 15) (25, 19) (20, 18) (20, 21) (20, 26) (20, 29) (20, 22) (29, 12) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 23) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 29) (23, 24) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 16) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 24) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 15) (13, 4) (13, 3) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 16) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 24) (15, 16) (22, 11) (22, 28) (22, 20) (9, 28) (9, 3) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 13) (16, 19) (16, 5) (16, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0-14-26-23-24-0
- Cycle 2: 0-6-12-21-20-29-23-26-14-0
- Cycle 3: 2-3-13-4-17-2
- Cycle 4: 2-17-27-28-22-20-21-12-6-0-14-2
- Cycle 5: 5-18-20-21-12-6-24-5
- Cycle 6: 5-8-19-1-29-20-26-23-24-15-7-15-11-10-4-13-3-9-28-22-20-29-1-19-16-5

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- <0, 14, (26, 23), 24, 0>
- <0, 6, 12, 21, (20, 29), 23, 26, 14, 0>
- <2, 3, 13, 4, (17), 2>
- <2, 17, (27, 28), 22, 20, 21, 12, 6, 0, 14>
- <5, 18, 20, 21, 12, 6, 24, 5>
- <5, 8, 19, 1, (29), 20, 26, 23, 24, 15, 7, 15, 11, 10, 4, 13, 3, 9, 28, 22, 20, 29, 1, 19, 16, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
