Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles in the graph, but we only consider cycles of length 4 in this case since we are looking for chordal 4-cycles.

The cycles of length 4 in this graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 3, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 1, 8, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 0, 3, 2, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 4, 0, 3, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 2, 7, 8, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 7, 2, 4)
- Cycle 8: (1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
- Cycle 9: (3, 7, 8, 1, 3)
- Cycle 10: (6, 1, 8, 7, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 2, 3, 0, 6)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (4, 8) -> Chordal 4-cycle <1, (4, 8), 5)>
- Cycle 2 has one chord (3, 7) -> Chordal 4-cycle <2, (3, 7), 5)>
- Cycle 3 has one chord (1, 8) -> Chordal 4-cycle <3, (1, 8), 5)>
- Cycle 4 has one chord (0, 3) -> Chordal 4-cycle <4, (0, 3), 5)>
- Cycle 5 has one chord (9, 3) -> Chordal 4-cycle <5, (9, 3), 4)>
- Cycle 6 has one chord (7, 8) -> Chordal 4-cycle <6, (7, 8), 9)>
- Cycle 7 has one chord (2, 7) -> Chordal 4-cycle <7, (2, 7), 4)>
- Cycle 8 has one chord (0, 2) -> Chordal 4-cycle <8, (0, 2), 1)>
- Cycle 9 has one chord (8, 1) -> Chordal 4-cycle <9, (8, 1), 3)>
- Cycle 10 has one chord (6, 8) -> Non-chordal cycle
- Cycle 11 has one chord (1, 0) -> Non-chordal cycle

Step 3:
There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [9].
