Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 0) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 6, 4, 13, 9)
- Cycle 3: (6, 4, 13, 8, 6)
- Cycle 4: (4, 13, 8, 3, 4)
- Cycle 5: (13, 8, 3, 1, 13)
- Cycle 6: (8, 3, 1, 11, 8)
- Cycle 7: (3, 1, 11, 9, 3)
- Cycle 8: (1, 11, 9, 6, 1)
- Cycle 9: (11, 9, 6, 4, 11)
- Cycle 10: (9, 6, 3, 1, 9)
- Cycle 11: (6, 3, 1, 13, 6)
- Cycle 12: (3, 1, 13, 4, 3)
- Cycle 13: (1, 13, 4, 0, 1)
- Cycle 14: (13, 4, 0, 7, 13)
- Cycle 15: (4, 0, 7, 14, 4)
- Cycle 16: (0, 7, 14, 12, 0)
- Cycle 17: (7, 14, 12, 8, 7)
- Cycle 18: (14, 12, 8, 6, 14)
- Cycle 19: (12, 8, 6, 9, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: Chord (6, 9): <1, (6, 9), 5>
- Cycle 2: Chord (6, 9): <2, (6, 9), 13>
- Cycle 3: Chord (8, 6): <3, (8, 6), 4>
- Cycle 4: Chord (8, 3): <4, (8, 3), 13>
- Cycle 5: Chord (1, 13): <5, (1, 13), 8>
- Cycle 6: Chord (1, 11): <6, (1, 11), 3>
- Cycle 7: Chord (9, 3): <7, (9, 3), 1>
- Cycle 8: Chord (9, 1): <8, (9, 1), 11>
- Cycle 9: Chord (6, 4): <9, (6, 4), 9>
- Cycle 10: Chord (6, 3): <10, (6, 3), 1>
- Cycle 11: Chord (13, 4): <11, (13, 4), 0>
- Cycle 12: Chord (13, 0): <12, (13, 0), 7>
- Cycle 13: Chord (7, 14): <13, (7, 14), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 13 chordal 4-cycles: [13]
