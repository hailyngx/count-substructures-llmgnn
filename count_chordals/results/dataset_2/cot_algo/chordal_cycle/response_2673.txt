Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-5-7
- Cycle 2: 4-8-7-1
- Cycle 3: 4-5-7-9
- Cycle 4: 4-9-2-7
- Cycle 5: 0-4-6-5
- Cycle 6: 0-8-7-5
- Cycle 7: 2-9-7-5

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-5-7 has 1 chord: (3, 7)
- Cycle 2: 4-8-7-1 has 1 chord: (8, 1)
- Cycle 3: 4-5-7-9 has 1 chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 4: 4-9-2-7 has 1 chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 6: 0-8-7-5 has 1 chord: (8, 5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (3, 7), 5>
- <4, (8, 1), 7>
- <4, (5, 9), 7>
- <4, (9, 2), 7>
- <0, (8, 5), 7>
