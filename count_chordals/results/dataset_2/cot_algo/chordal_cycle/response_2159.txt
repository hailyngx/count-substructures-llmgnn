Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (6, 5, 2, 8, 6)
2. (6, 3, 9, 4, 6)
3. (6, 2, 8, 4, 6)
4. (6, 8, 7, 5, 6)
5. (6, 4, 9, 3, 6)
6. (6, 8, 1, 2, 6)
7. (6, 4, 0, 7, 6)
8. (5, 2, 8, 7, 5)
9. (5, 3, 6, 2, 5)
10. (5, 7, 8, 1, 5)
11. (2, 8, 7, 1, 2)
12. (2, 2, 3, 9, 2) - Not a valid cycle

Step 2: 
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. <6, (5, 8), 6> - Chord: (5, 8)
2. <6, (3, 9), 6> - Chord: (3, 9)
3. <6, (2, 4), 6> - Chord: (2, 4)
4. <6, (8, 7), 6> - Chord: (8, 7)
5. <6, (4, 9), 6> - Chord: (4, 9)
6. <6, (1, 8), 6> - Chord: (1, 8)
7. <6, (0, 7), 6> - Chord: (0, 7)
8. <5, (2, 8), 5> - Chord: (2, 8)
9. <5, (3, 6), 5> - Chord: (3, 6)
10. <5, (7, 1), 5> - Chord: (7, 1)
11. <2, (7, 1), 2> - Chord: (7, 1)

Step 3:
- There are 11 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [11].
