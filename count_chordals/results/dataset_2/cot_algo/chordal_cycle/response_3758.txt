Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 12) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 12) (21, 14) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 28) (25, 23) (25, 10) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 11) (23, 25) (23, 29) (23, 10) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 12) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 21) (12, 18) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 26) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 4) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 16) (13, 21) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 20) (17, 13) (17, 6) (22, 2) (22, 16) (0, 9) (10, 25) (10, 8) (10, 23) (6, 17) (6, 24) (6, 19) (24, 7) (24, 6) (24, 1) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 1) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 27) (19, 6) (19, 29) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 19) (1, 24) (1, 14) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 22) (16, 4) (27, 7) (27, 9) (11, 8) (4, 3) (4, 26) (4, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 12, 21)
- Cycle 2: (7, 12, 21, 13)
- Cycle 3: (20, 28, 26, 4)
- Cycle 4: (2, 18, 16, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 18, 16, 22)
- Cycle 6: (13, 21, 14, 1)
- Cycle 7: (10, 25, 23, 29)
- Cycle 8: (6, 17, 20, 26)
- Cycle 9: (24, 6, 17, 13)
- Cycle 10: (9, 2, 18, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (12, 21) - Chordal cycle: <1, (12, 21), 15>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (12, 21) - Chordal cycle: <2, (12, 21), 7>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (26, 28) - Chordal cycle: <3, (26, 28), 20>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (16, 18) - Chordal cycle: <4, (16, 18), 2>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (16, 18) - Chordal cycle: <5, (16, 18), 5>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (14, 21) - Chordal cycle: <6, (14, 21), 13>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (23, 29) - Chordal cycle: <7, (23, 29), 10>
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (20, 26) - Chordal cycle: <8, (20, 26), 17>
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (17, 13) - Chordal cycle: <9, (17, 13), 6>
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (18, 16) - Chordal cycle: <10, (18, 16), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
