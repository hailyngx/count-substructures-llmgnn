Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 1 - 9 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 2: 2 - 9 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 3: 3 - 1 - 9 - 3
- Cycle 4: 4 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 5: 5 - 6 - 9 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 6: 6 - 7 - 4 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 7: 7 - 9 - 8 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 8: 8 - 9 - 1 - 5 - 8
- Cycle 9: 9 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 10: 9 - 8 - 1 - 3 - 9

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: <1, (2, 6), 9>
- Cycle 2: <2, (3, 9), 6>
- Cycle 3: <3, (1, 9), 7>
- Cycle 4: <4, (5, 7), 6>
- Cycle 5: <5, (1, 9), 6>
- Cycle 6: <6, (7, 4), 9>
- Cycle 7: <7, (8, 9), 4>
- Cycle 8: <8, (1, 5), 9>
- Cycle 9: <9, (7, 4), 6>
- Cycle 10: <9, (1, 3), 8>

Step 3: 
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
