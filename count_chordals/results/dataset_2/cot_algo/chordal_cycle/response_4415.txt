Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-6-2-1-0
- Cycle 2: 1-2-6-7-1
- Cycle 3: 1-2-3-8-1
- Cycle 4: 1-2-3-6-1
- Cycle 5: 1-2-3-2-1
- Cycle 6: 1-4-0-6-1
- Cycle 7: 1-4-7-6-1
- Cycle 8: 1-4-7-5-1
- Cycle 9: 1-4-7-9-1
- Cycle 10: 1-7-6-2-1
- Cycle 11: 2-6-0-4-2
- Cycle 12: 2-6-7-5-2
- Cycle 13: 2-6-7-9-2
- Cycle 14: 3-2-6-0-3
- Cycle 15: 3-2-6-7-3
- Cycle 16: 3-2-1-4-3
- Cycle 17: 4-0-6-7-4
- Cycle 18: 4-0-6-2-4
- Cycle 19: 4-1-2-3-4
- Cycle 20: 4-1-7-6-4
- Cycle 21: 4-1-7-9-4
- Cycle 22: 4-7-6-2-4
- Cycle 23: 6-0-4-1-6
- Cycle 24: 6-0-4-7-6
- Cycle 25: 6-1-2-7-6
- Cycle 26: 6-1-4-7-6
- Cycle 27: 6-2-1-4-6
- Cycle 28: 7-1-4-0-7
- Cycle 29: 7-1-4-6-7
- Cycle 30: 7-1-2-6-7
- Cycle 31: 7-4-0-6-7
- Cycle 32: 8-3-2-6-8
- Cycle 33: 8-3-2-1-8
- Cycle 34: 9-7-4-0-9
- Cycle 35: 9-7-4-1-9

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (2, 6), 7>
- <6, (0, 4), 7>
- <6, (1, 2), 7>
- <6, (1, 7), 7>
- <7, (1, 4), 6>
- <8, (2, 6), 3>
- <9, (4, 0), 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (2, 6), 7>
- <6, (0, 4), 7>
- <6, (1, 2), 7>
- <6, (1, 7), 7>
- <7, (1, 4), 6>
- <8, (2, 6), 3>
- <9, (4, 0), 7>
