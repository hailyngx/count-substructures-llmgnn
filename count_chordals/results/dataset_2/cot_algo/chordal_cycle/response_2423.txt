Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 25) (0, 4) (0, 29) (0, 12) (0, 2) (27, 14) (7, 21) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 22) (21, 2) (10, 11) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 29) (23, 11) (23, 6) (23, 24) (23, 9) (12, 0) (12, 20) (12, 17) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 23) (6, 5) (28, 29) (28, 26) (29, 0) (29, 8) (29, 28) (29, 19) (26, 28) (26, 16) (26, 4) (2, 0) (2, 21) (2, 22) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 20) (22, 25) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 29) (19, 22) (19, 18) (9, 7) (9, 23) (9, 18) (9, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 24) (1, 20) (1, 25) (20, 12) (20, 22) (20, 1) (14, 27) (14, 5) (14, 13) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (16, 5) (16, 26) (16, 4) (24, 23) (24, 17) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 26) (4, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph based on the given edges:
- Cycle 1: {3, 15, 6, 11, 10, 18, 9, 7, 21, 2, 0, 4, 26, 16, 5} with 14 edges
- Cycle 2: {27, 14, 13, 9, 18, 19, 22, 21, 7} with 8 edges
- Cycle 3: {20, 12, 0, 29, 19, 22, 21, 7} with 7 edges
- Cycle 4: {24, 17, 3, 4, 26, 16, 5, 8} with 7 edges
- Cycle 5: {25, 15, 3, 4, 26, 16, 5, 14} with 8 edges

Step 2:
Adding chords to the cycles:
- Adding chord {23, 6} to cycle 1
- Adding chord {14, 27} to cycle 2
- Adding chord {20, 1} to cycle 3
- Adding chord {24, 23} to cycle 4
- Adding chord {1, 25} to cycle 5

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have found 5 chordal 4-cycles.
So, the final answer is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <3, 15, 6, 11>
2. <27, 14, 13, 9>
3. <20, 12, 0, 29>
4. <24, 17, 3, 4>
5. <25, 15, 3, 4>
