Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 4 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 1 - 3 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 6 - 2 - 7 - 0

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (6, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 1, 4, 8, (1, 8)>
<0, 1, 3, 6, (1, 3)>
<0, 6, 2, 7, (6, 7)>
