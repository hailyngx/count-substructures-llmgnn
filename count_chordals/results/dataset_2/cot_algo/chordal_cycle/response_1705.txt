Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 13) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 10) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.

        - Cycle 1: (6, 5, 3, 2)
        - Cycle 2: (9, 8, 5, 3)
        - Cycle 3: (9, 12, 4, 3)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 8, 11, 3)
        - Cycle 5: (8, 7, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (6, 10, 13, 0)
        - Cycle 7: (10, 14, 1, 8)
        - Cycle 8: (14, 2, 0, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Cycle 1 has a chord (5, 2).
        - Cycle 2 has a chord (8, 3).
        - Cycle 3 has no chord.
        - Cycle 4 has no chord.
        - Cycle 5 has no chord.
        - Cycle 6 has no chord.
        - Cycle 7 has no chord.
        - Cycle 8 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are 4 chordless cycles in the graph: cycle 3, cycle 4, cycle 5, and cycle 6.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        <3, (9, 12), 4>
        <4, (5, 8), 11>
        <5, (8, 7), 6>
        <6, (10, 14), 13>
