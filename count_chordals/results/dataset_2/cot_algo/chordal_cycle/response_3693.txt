Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 26) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 9) (25, 13) (25, 2) (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 8) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 2) (29, 28) (29, 18) (29, 3) (22, 24) (26, 27) (26, 15) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 23) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 19) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 17) (23, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (16, 3) (16, 21) (16, 8) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 16) (17, 23) (18, 29) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 19) (18, 24) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 6) (1, 12) (1, 24) (2, 25) (2, 28) (8, 20) (8, 15) (8, 16) (8, 24) (24, 22) (24, 18) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 7) (7, 24) (13, 25) (13, 9) (13, 23) (5, 4) (5, 10) (10, 19) (10, 5) (10, 14) (14, 19) (14, 10) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 27, 26, 15, 20, 9, 23, 13, 25, 2, 28, 29, 3, 11, 19, 10, 5, 4, 12, 6, 0)
- Cycle 2: (3, 29, 28, 2, 25, 13, 9, 20, 15, 26, 27, 0, 6, 12, 4, 5, 10, 19, 11, 3)
- Cycle 3: (8, 20, 15, 26, 27, 21, 0, 6, 12, 1, 24, 22, 24, 18, 29, 3, 16, 21, 0, 28, 2, 25, 13, 23, 9, 20, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (15, 9)
- Cycle 2 has chord (20, 15)
- Cycle 3 has chord (21, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. As all cycles have at least one chord, there are no chordless cycles in this graph.
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 27, 26, 15, (9, 20)>
- <3, 29, 28, 2, (15, 20)>
- <8, 20, 15, 26, 27, 21, 0, 6, 12, 1, 24, (21, 8)>
