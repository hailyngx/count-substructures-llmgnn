Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 22) (5, 21) (9, 5) (9, 11) (3, 28) (3, 2) (25, 17) (25, 26) (25, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 22) (4, 20) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 29) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 15) (17, 25) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 18) (29, 8) (29, 17) (29, 6) (29, 16) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 14) (20, 4) (6, 29) (26, 25) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 27) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 27) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 21) (19, 18) (19, 13) (22, 5) (22, 4) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 27) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 26) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 1) (2, 3) (2, 24) (16, 25) (16, 29) (16, 24) (16, 0) (24, 2) (24, 16) (0, 28) (0, 16) (0, 1) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 21) (21, 5) (21, 4) (21, 18) (21, 13) (23, 17) (1, 28) (1, 14) (1, 0) (27, 26) (27, 28) (27, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph, however, only one of them has exactly one chord. 

The cycle <5, 21, 4, 22> has a chord between vertices 5 and 22. Therefore, this cycle is the only chordal 4-cycle in the graph.

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
