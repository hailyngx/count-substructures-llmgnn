Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 0) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 4) (18, 19) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (15, 16) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (14, 17, 0, 13, 4, 1, 12, 19, 0)
- Cycle 2: (14, 11, 2, 9, 4, 13, 6, 8, 14)
- Cycle 3: (16, 1, 4, 10, 16)
- Cycle 4: (5, 19, 12, 1, 4, 10, 5)
- Cycle 5: (7, 2, 9, 4, 10, 16, 15, 16, 1, 12, 3, 12, 19, 0, 17, 14, 11, 2, 7, 6, 8, 16, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Examining the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (14, 13).
- Cycle 2 has one chord (14, 2).
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has one chord (19, 5).
- Cycle 5 has one chord (7, 16).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, which are:
1. <1, (14, 13), 12, 19>
2. <2, (14, 2), 11, 8>
3. <4, (7, 16), 10, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
