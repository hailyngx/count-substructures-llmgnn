Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 11, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 10, 11, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 10, 3, 11, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 10, 6, 11, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 10, 13, 9, 4, 1, 5>
- Cycle 6: <10, 11, 3, 8, 7, 2, 1, 5, 10>
- Cycle 7: <10, 13, 9, 4, 1, 2, 7, 13, 10>
- Cycle 8: <10, 13, 9, 4, 6, 0, 12, 14, 10>
- Cycle 9: <10, 13, 7, 2, 1, 4, 6, 10>
- Cycle 10: <10, 14, 12, 0, 6, 4, 1, 11, 10>
- Cycle 11: <10, 14, 3, 11, 1, 2, 7, 8, 10>
- Cycle 12: <11, 5, 10, 6, 0, 12, 1, 11>
- Cycle 13: <11, 5, 10, 13, 9, 4, 6, 11>
- Cycle 14: <11, 3, 8, 7, 13, 9, 4, 1, 11>
- Cycle 15: <11, 6, 10, 13, 7, 2, 1, 4, 11>
- Cycle 16: <10, 6, 4, 1, 2, 7, 8, 3, 10>
- Cycle 17: <10, 13, 7, 8, 3, 14, 2, 1, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- From the above cycles, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
    - Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 10, 3, 11, 5> with one chord (10, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordless cycles = 17 - 1 = 16

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
