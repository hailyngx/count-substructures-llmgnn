Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (9, 1, 3, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 1, 6, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 2, 3, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 2, 4, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 2, 7, 6, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 3, 1, 6, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 3, 2, 7, 6, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 4, 0, 5, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has chord (1,3): <1, (1, 3), 3, 9>
- Cycle 2 has chord (1,6): <2, (1, 6), 3, 9>
- Cycle 3 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 4 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 5 has chord (2, 7): <5, (2, 7), 6, 9>
- Cycle 6 has chord (1, 6): <6, (1, 6), 3, 9>
- Cycle 7 has chord (2, 7): <7, (2, 7), 6, 9>
- Cycle 8 has chord (0, 5): <8, (0, 5), 9, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 2 chordless cycles in the graph, namely cycles 3 and 4.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
