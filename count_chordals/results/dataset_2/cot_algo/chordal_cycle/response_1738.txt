Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 8, 9, 2, 1>
- <0, 8, 9, 7, 1>
- <5, 6, 7, 1, 3>
- <5, 6, 7, 1, 2>
- <5, 7, 6, 9, 2>
- <5, 7, 6, 9, 8>
- <5, 7, 1, 3, 4>
- <5, 7, 1, 3, 2>
- <5, 7, 1, 2, 9>
- <5, 7, 1, 2, 3>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <5, 6, 7, 1, (2, 9)>

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final number is [1].
