Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-6-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-9-1
- Cycle 4: 1-7-10-11-9-1
- Cycle 5: 2-3-6-1-5-9-2
- Cycle 6: 2-3-8-14-11-10-6-2
- Cycle 7: 2-6-10-11-9-3-2
- Cycle 8: 2-6-3-1-7-10-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-1 has a chord 1-9
- Cycle 2: 1-3-6-1 has no chord
- Cycle 3: 1-7-9-1 has a chord 1-9
- Cycle 4: 1-7-10-11-9-1 has no chord
- Cycle 5: 2-3-6-1-5-9-2 has no chord
- Cycle 6: 2-3-8-14-11-10-6-2 has no chord
- Cycle 7: 2-6-10-11-9-3-2 has a chord 6-11
- Cycle 8: 2-6-3-1-7-10-2 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 4

Final Result: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 5, 9, 1>
- <1, 3, 6, 1>
- <1, 7, 10, 11, 9, 1>
- <2, 3, 8, 14, 11, 10, 6, 2>
