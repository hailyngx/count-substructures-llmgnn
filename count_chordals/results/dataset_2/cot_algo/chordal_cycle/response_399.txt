Step 2:  
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 27, 28, 4>  with chord (27, 28)
<0, 27, 24, 10>  with chord (27, 24)
<3, 10, 24, 0>  with chord (10, 24)
<3, 19, 20, 7>  with chord (19, 7)
<26, 2, 4, 28>  with chord (2, 28)
<3, 19, 20, 7>  with chord (19, 7)
<17, 25, 26, 1>  with chord (25, 26)
<15, 26, 2, 4>  with chord (26, 2)
<15, 26, 2, 4>  with chord (26, 2)
<8, 27, 24, 10>  with chord (27, 24)
<25, 26, 1, 13>  with chord (26, 1)
<22, 16, 2, 26>  with chord (16, 26)
<11, 8, 27, 24>  with chord (8, 24)

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found gives us [13].
