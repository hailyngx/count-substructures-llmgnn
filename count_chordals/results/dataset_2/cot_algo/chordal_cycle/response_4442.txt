Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-5-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-7-4-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-4-8-0
- Cycle 4: 0-3-7-9-0
- Cycle 5: 0-6-4-7-0
- Cycle 6: 0-6-1-4-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Among the identified cycles:
- Cycle 1 <0, 9, 5, 7, 0> has one chord (7, 5) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2 <0, 7, 4, 1, 0> has one chord (1, 4) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 <0, 1, 4, 8, 0> does not have a chord.
- Cycle 4 <0, 3, 7, 9, 0> does not have a chord.
- Cycle 5 <0, 6, 4, 7, 0> has one chord (4, 6) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 6 <0, 6, 1, 4, 0> has one chord (1, 6) making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 3 chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, 9, 5, 7, 0> (chord: (7, 5))
2. <0, 7, 4, 1, 0> (chord: (1, 4))
3. <0, 6, 4, 7, 0> (chord: (4, 6))

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
