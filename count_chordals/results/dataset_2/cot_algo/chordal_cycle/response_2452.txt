Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-8-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-7-4-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-4-6-1
- Cycle 4: 1-5-2-4-1
- Cycle 5: 1-3-4-6-1
- Cycle 6: 1-3-7-4-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-8-1 does not have a chord
- Cycle 2: 1-5-7-4-1 has a chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 3: 1-5-4-6-1 has a chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 4: 1-5-2-4-1 has a chord (5, 2)
- Cycle 5: 1-3-4-6-1 has a chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 6: 1-3-7-4-1 has a chord (3, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
There is 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 5, 9, 8> with the chord (5, 9).
