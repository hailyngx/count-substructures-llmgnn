Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-9-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-4-5-1
- Cycle 3: 1-2-4-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-9-8-1
- Cycle 5: 1-3-8-9-1
- Cycle 6: 1-2-4-6-1
- Cycle 7: 1-3-4-6-1
- Cycle 8: 1-3-6-4-1
- Cycle 9: 1-3-8-7-1
- Cycle 10: 1-3-6-0-1

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 9, 5>: Chord (3, 5)
- <1, 3, 4, 5>: Chord (3, 4)
- <1, 2, 4, 5>: Chord (2, 5)
- <1, 3, 9, 8>: Chord (3, 8)
- <1, 3, 8, 9>: Chord (3, 9)
- <1, 2, 4, 6>: Chord (2, 4)
- <1, 3, 4, 6>: Chord (3, 6)
- <1, 3, 6, 4>: Chord (3, 4)
- <1, 3, 8, 7>: Chord (3, 7)
- <1, 3, 6, 0>: Chord (3, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
