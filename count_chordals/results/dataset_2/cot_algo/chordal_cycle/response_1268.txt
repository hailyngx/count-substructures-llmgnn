Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-5-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-6-7-1
- Cycle 3: 3-5-6-7-3
- Cycle 4: 3-8-6-7-3
- Cycle 5: 2-3-8-9-2
- Cycle 6: 2-3-5-1-2

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (3, 5), 4>
- <1, (5, 6), 7>
- <3, (5, 7), 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [3]
