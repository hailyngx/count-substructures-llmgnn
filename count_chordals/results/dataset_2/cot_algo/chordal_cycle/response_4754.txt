- Cycle 4: {2, 29, 15, 22}
- Cycle 5: {2, 29, 14, 24}
- Cycle 6: {2, 29, 15, 6}
- Cycle 7: {2, 29, 8, 11}
- Cycle 8: {29, 17, 20, 28}
- Cycle 9: {29, 17, 11, 21}
- Cycle 10: {29, 8, 19, 16}
- Cycle 11: {29, 8, 11, 21}

- Cycle 18: {20, 28, 25, 4}
- Cycle 19: {20, 28, 25, 5}
- Cycle 20: {8, 19, 16, 21}
- Cycle 21: {8, 11, 21, 16}
- Cycle 22: {14, 26, 10, 4}
- Cycle 23: {14, 26, 10, 5}
- Cycle 24: {26, 10, 4, 25}
- Cycle 25: {26, 10, 5, 25}
- Cycle 26: {16, 21, 12, 27}
- Cycle 27: {16, 21, 12, 27}
- Cycle 28: {6, 23, 24, 14}
- Cycle 29: {6, 23, 24, 2}

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <2, 29, 14, 26> (Chord: (2,26))
- <2, 29, 17, 22> (Chord: (2,22))
- <2, 29, 8, 19> (Chord: (2,19))
- <2, 29, 15, 22> (Chord: (2,15))
- <2, 29, 14, 24> (Chord: (24,14))
- <29, 17, 20, 28> (Chord: (28,17))
- <29, 17, 11, 21> (Chord: (11,17))
- <29, 8, 19, 16> (Chord: (8,19))
- <29, 14, 26, 10> (Chord: (10,14))
- <17, 20, 28, 25> (Chord: (20,25))
- <17, 11, 21, 16> (Chord: (21,11))
- <20, 28, 25, 4> (Chord: (25,4))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [12]
