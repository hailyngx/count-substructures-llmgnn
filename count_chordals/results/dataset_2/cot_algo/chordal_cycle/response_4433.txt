Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 19) (22, 17) (22, 12) (22, 25) (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 1) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 11) (26, 12) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 2) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 23) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 8) (20, 25) (20, 24) (20, 28) (25, 22) (25, 20) (25, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (12, 22) (12, 26) (12, 7) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 25) (4, 27) (4, 6) (16, 28) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 14) (28, 23) (10, 2) (10, 21) (10, 18) (21, 26) (21, 10) (21, 24) (11, 26) (11, 7) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 17) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (14, 27) (14, 28) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 24) (23, 9) (23, 27) (23, 28) (23, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 18) (18, 10) (18, 1) (17, 22) (17, 19) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 23) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <1, 18, 10, 21>
- <3, 14, 27, 23>
- <5, 25, 20, 24>
- <6, 8, 29, 2>
- <7, 12, 26, 21>
- <9, 26, 12, 7>
- <13, 19, 17, 22>
- <15, 2, 29, 9>
- <16, 28, 14, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 18, 10, 21> has no chords.
- <3, 14, 27, 23> has no chords.
- <5, 25, 20, 24> has no chords.
- <6, 8, 29, 2> has chord (8, 29).
- <7, 12, 26, 21> has chord (12, 21).
- <9, 26, 12, 7> has chord (26, 7).
- <13, 19, 17, 22> has no chords.
- <15, 2, 29, 9> has chord (2, 9).
- <16, 28, 14, 3> has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found: <6, 8, 29, 2>, <7, 12, 26, 21>, <9, 26, 12, 7>, <15, 2, 29, 9>.
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
