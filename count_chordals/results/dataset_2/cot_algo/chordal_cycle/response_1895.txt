Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 18) (17, 14) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 1) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 9) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 6) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 14) (18, 0) (16, 19) (16, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 16) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- 0-1-8-4-0
- 0-1-11-6-0
- 0-8-4-12-0
- 7-2-6-11-7
- 10-5-11-1-10
- 14-3-6-15-14
- 15-6-12-4-15

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- 0-1-8-4-0 has one chord: (1, 8)
- 0-1-11-6-0 has one chord: (1, 6)
- 0-8-4-12-0 has one chord: (8, 4)
- 7-2-6-11-7 has one chord: (2, 11)
- 10-5-11-1-10 has one chord: (5, 1)
- 14-3-6-15-14 has one chord: (3, 15)
- 15-6-12-4-15 has one chord: (6, 12)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 1, 8, 4, (1, 8)>
- <0, 1, 11, 6, (1, 6)>
- <0, 8, 4, 12, (8, 4)>
- <7, 2, 6, 11, (2, 11)>
- <10, 5, 11, 1, (5, 1)>
- <14, 3, 6, 15, (3, 15)>
- <15, 6, 12, 4, (6, 12)>
