Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-10-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-5-0

- Cycle 4: 0-5-4-7-0
- Cycle 5: 1-10-4-5-1
- Cycle 6: 1-10-13-1
- Cycle 7: 1-12-7-4-1
- Cycle 8: 2-0-4-10-2
- Cycle 9: 2-0-4-5-2
- Cycle 10: 2-1-10-13-2
- Cycle 11: 3-11-10-4-3
- Cycle 12: 3-11-10-13-3
- Cycle 13: 3-11-8-6-3
- Cycle 14: 3-14-5-4-3
- Cycle 15: 3-14-5-12-3
- Cycle 16: 3-8-12-5-3
- Cycle 17: 3-8-11-10-3
- Cycle 18: 4-7-12-5-4
- Cycle 19: 5-4-7-13-5
- Cycle 20: 5-12-7-13-5
- Cycle 21: 6-5-4-7-6
- Cycle 22: 6-5-12-7-6
- Cycle 23: 6-14-13-7-6
- Cycle 24: 6-14-5-12-6
- Cycle 25: 7-4-0-10-7
- Cycle 26: 8-6-5-4-8
- Cycle 27: 8-6-14-5-8
- Cycle 28: 8-11-10-4-8
- Cycle 29: 9-0-4-5-9
- Cycle 30: 9-0-5-4-9
- Cycle 31: 10-4-7-12-10
- Cycle 32: 10-4-5-12-10
- Cycle 33: 10-11-3-14-10
- Cycle 34: 11-3-14-13-11
- Cycle 35: 11-9-0-4-11
- Cycle 36: 12-7-4-5-12
- Cycle 37: 12-7-13-10-12
- Cycle 38: 13-10-11-9-13
- Cycle 39: 13-10-7-4-13
- Cycle 40: 13-10-4-5-13

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, (5, 4), 10>
- <1, (4, 7), 10>
- <3, (11, 10), 13>

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [37].
