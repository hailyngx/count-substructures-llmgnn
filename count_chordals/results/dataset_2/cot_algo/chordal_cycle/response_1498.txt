Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 1 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 2: 4 - 2 - 3 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 9 - 1 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 4: 7 - 1 - 3 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 5: 7 - 8 - 5 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 6: 1 - 3 - 2 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 5 - 6 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 8: 3 - 2 - 6 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 9: 9 - 1 - 5 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 10: 8 - 3 - 0 - 6 - 8
- Cycle 11: 5 - 6 - 0 - 2 - 5

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <4, 7, 1, 8> with chord (7, 1)
- <4, 2, 3, 8> with chord (2, 3)
- <4, 9, 1, 8> with chord (9, 1)
- <7, 1, 3, 8> with chord (1, 3)
- <7, 8, 5, 1> with chord (8, 5)
- <1, 3, 2, 4> with chord (3, 2)
- <1, 5, 6, 0> with chord (5, 6)
- <3, 2, 6, 0> with chord (2, 6)
- <9, 1, 5, 8> with chord (1, 5)
- <8, 3, 0, 6> with chord (3, 0)
- <5, 6, 0, 2> with chord (6, 0)

Step 3:
Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [11]
