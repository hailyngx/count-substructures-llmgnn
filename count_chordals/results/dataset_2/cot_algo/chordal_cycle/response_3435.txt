The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 25) (3, 17) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 5) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 0) (12, 7) (12, 20) (27, 5) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 2) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 9) (0, 26) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 29) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 27) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 22) (6, 15) (6, 18) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 2) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 22) (21, 28) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 15) (28, 21) (28, 19) (28, 24) (28, 20) (24, 8) (24, 28) (24, 11) (26, 0) (26, 15) (18, 6) (18, 9) (19, 28) (19, 23) (19, 15) (23, 21) (23, 19) (23, 20) (16, 29) (16, 2) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 11) (15, 6) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 19) (11, 24) (11, 9) (20, 1) (20, 12) (20, 28) (20, 23) (25, 1) (25, 2) (13, 4) (13, 2) (29, 14) (29, 16) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 16) (2, 25) (2, 13) (22, 7) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 17, 10, 7>
- <0, 17, 10, 5>
- <0, 17, 3, 5>
- <0, 14, 4, 2>
- <0, 14, 4, 13>
- <0, 14, 29, 16>
- <0, 9, 18, 6>
- <0, 9, 11, 24>
- <0, 9, 11, 9>
- <0, 26, 15, 6>
- <0, 26, 15, 21>
- <0, 26, 15, 19>
- <0, 26, 15, 26>
- <1, 20, 12, 7>
- <1, 20, 12, 20>
- <2, 7, 12, 20>
- <2, 7, 22, 6>
- <2, 4, 14, 0>
- <2, 4, 13, 29>
- <2, 4, 13, 2>
- <2, 4, 14, 29>
- <2, 4, 13, 14>
- <2, 16, 29, 14>
- <2, 16, 29, 16>
- <2, 16, 29, 13>
- <2, 25, 1, 20>
- <2, 25, 1, 25>
- <3, 17, 10, 5>
- <4, 14, 8, 22>
- <5, 10, 7, 12>
- <6, 22, 7, 12>
- <8, 14, 4, 2>
- <8, 22, 7, 12>
- <8, 22, 7, 2>
- <8, 24, 11, 9>
- <9, 18, 6, 22>
- <9, 11, 24, 8>
- <14, 0, 17, 10>
- <14, 0, 17, 3>
- <14, 0, 26, 15>
- <14, 4, 13, 2>
- <15, 6, 22, 7>
- <15, 6, 18, 9>
- <15, 19, 28, 21>
- <15, 19, 23, 21>
- <15, 19, 23, 20>
- <16, 29, 14, 0>
- <17, 0, 14, 4>
- <17, 0, 9, 18>
- <17, 10, 5, 27>
- <19, 28, 21, 22>
- <21, 28, 24, 11>
- <21, 22, 7, 12>
- <22, 7, 12, 20>
- <22, 7, 2, 4>
- <22, 7, 2, 25>
- <23, 19, 28, 21>
- <24, 8, 14, 4>
- <24, 11, 9, 18>
- <25, 2, 7, 12>
- <26, 0, 17, 10>
- <26, 0, 17, 3>
- <26, 0, 14, 4>
- <26, 0, 14, 29>
- <26, 15, 6, 22>
- <27, 5, 3, 17>
- <28, 19, 23, 20>
- <29, 14, 4, 2>

Step 2:
- <0, 17, 10, 7> has exactly one chord: (10, 7)
- <0, 9, 11, 24> has exactly one chord: (9, 11)
- <1, 20, 12, 7> has exactly one chord: (12, 7)
- <2, 7, 22, 6> has exactly one chord: (22, 6)
- <22, 7, 12, 20> has exactly one chord: (12, 20)

Step 3:
We found 5 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [5].
