Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 1 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 7 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 9 - 8 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 9 - 8 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 1 - 3 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 1 - 6 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 7: 9 - 7 - 9 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 8: 9 - 7 - 9 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 9: 9 - 8 - 2 - 5 - 9
- Cycle 10: 9 - 8 - 6 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 11: 9 - 8 - 6 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 12: 9 - 8 - 6 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 13: 9 - 8 - 3 - 0 - 9
- Cycle 14: 9 - 8 - 2 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 15: 4 - 8 - 3 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 16: 4 - 8 - 3 - 0 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- From Cycle 1, we find the chord (1, 6).
- From Cycle 2, we find the chord (9, 7).
- From Cycle 3, we find the chord (9, 8).
- From Cycle 9, we find the chord (9, 2).
- From Cycle 10, we find the chord (6, 1).
- From Cycle 13, we find the chord (8, 3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are as follows:
- <5, 9, 1, (1, 6), 6>
- <5, 9, 7, (9, 7), 9>
- <5, 9, 8, (9, 8), 2>
- <9, 8, 2, (9, 2), 5>
- <9, 1, 6, (6, 1), 8>
- <9, 8, 3, (8, 3), 0>
