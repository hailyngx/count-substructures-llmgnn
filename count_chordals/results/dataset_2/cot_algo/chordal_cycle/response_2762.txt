Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 19) (8, 11) (8, 4) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 16) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 7) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 6) (9, 0) (9, 14) (18, 1) (18, 11) (2, 4) (2, 6) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 15) (7, 17) (13, 11) (13, 16) (17, 19) (17, 7) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 15, 0, 9, 14, 10, 11, 18, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 15, 0, 9, 14, 10, 11, 5, 3, 12, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 15, 7, 10, 11, 18, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 18, 11, 5, 3, 12, 16, 19, 7, 15, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 18, 11, 5, 14, 9, 0, 15, 7, 10, 11, 13, 16, 12, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 18, 11, 5, 14, 10, 7, 19, 17, 7, 15, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 12, 16, 19, 7, 15, 0, 9, 14, 10, 7, 17, 19, 4, 8, 11, 18, 1)
- Cycle 8: (3, 5, 11, 13, 16, 12, 6, 2, 4, 8, 11, 10, 14, 9, 0, 15, 7, 17, 19, 16, 13, 11, 18, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (14, 10)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (10, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 6 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<1, 15, 0, 9, 14, 10, 11, 18> with chord (14, 10)
<1, 15, 7, 10, 11, 18, 1> with chord (10, 7)
