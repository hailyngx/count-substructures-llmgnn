Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 10, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 9, 6, 10, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 9, 14, 10, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 14, 11, 3, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 14, 10, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 9, 14, 11, 0, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 9, 14, 10, 6, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 9, 14, 11, 3, 2, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 9, 14, 11, 0, 12, 4, 5)
- Cycle 10: (4, 9, 6, 14, 11, 3, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 9, 6, 14, 10, 5, 4)
- Cycle 12: (5, 9, 6, 14, 11, 0, 5)
- Cycle 13: (5, 9, 6, 14, 10, 4, 5)
- Cycle 14: (5, 9, 6, 14, 10, 2, 5)
- Cycle 15: (4, 9, 6, 14, 10, 2, 3, 4)
- Cycle 16: (5, 9, 14, 10, 2, 3, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (9, 10). Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (9, 10), 4>
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord (9, 14). Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (9, 14), 4>
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord (9, 14). Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (9, 14), 5>
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord (9, 14). Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (9, 14), 5>
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord (9, 14). Chordal 4-cycle: <7, (9, 14), 5>
- Cycle 10 has exactly one chord (9, 6). Chordal 4-cycle: <10, (9, 6), 4>
- Cycle 11 has exactly one chord (9, 6). Chordal 4-cycle: <11, (9, 6), 4>
- Cycle 12 has exactly one chord (9, 6). Chordal 4-cycle: <12, (9, 6), 5>
- Cycle 13 has exactly one chord (9, 6). Chordal 4-cycle: <13, (9, 6), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the answer is [8].
