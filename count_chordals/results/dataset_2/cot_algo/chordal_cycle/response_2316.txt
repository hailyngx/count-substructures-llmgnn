Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 14) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-13-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-3-9-0
- Cycle 3: 0-12-2-4-0
- Cycle 4: 1-4-9-14-1
- Cycle 5: 1-12-0-10-1
- Cycle 6: 2-4-9-14-2
- Cycle 7: 2-12-0-10-2
- Cycle 8: 3-5-0-12-3
- Cycle 9: 3-5-13-4-3
- Cycle 10: 3-9-14-11-3
- Cycle 11: 4-1-12-0-4
- Cycle 12: 4-2-12-0-4
- Cycle 13: 4-9-14-11-4
- Cycle 14: 5-0-12-2-5
- Cycle 15: 5-3-9-14-5
- Cycle 16: 5-10-0-12-5
- Cycle 17: 6-8-13-5-6
- Cycle 18: 7-3-5-0-7
- Cycle 19: 7-3-9-14-7
- Cycle 20: 8-6-13-4-8
- Cycle 21: 9-3-5-13-9
- Cycle 22: 9-4-1-12-9
- Cycle 23: 9-7-3-11-9
- Cycle 24: 9-14-11-3-9
- Cycle 25: 10-0-12-2-10
- Cycle 26: 10-1-12-0-10
- Cycle 27: 10-2-14-11-10
- Cycle 28: 10-5-13-4-10
- Cycle 29: 11-3-5-13-11
- Cycle 30: 11-9-14-2-11
- Cycle 31: 12-0-10-1-12
- Cycle 32: 12-2-4-9-12
- Cycle 33: 12-5-0-10-12
- Cycle 34: 13-4-9-3-13
- Cycle 35: 13-5-0-12-13
- Cycle 36: 13-6-8-1-13
- Cycle 37: 14-2-12-0-14
- Cycle 38: 14-4-9-11-14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (5, 13), 4, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, (5, 9), 14, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (1, 9), 14, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6, (8, 13), 5, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <7, (3, 9), 14, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <12, (0, 10), 1, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 38 cycles and 6 of them are chordal 4-cycles.
So, the number of chordless cycles is [32].
