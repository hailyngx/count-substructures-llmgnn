Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 10, 4, 12)
- Cycle 2: (3, 10, 12, 13)
- Cycle 3: (3, 1, 13, 5)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 8, 6)
- Cycle 5: (3, 1, 7, 11)
- Cycle 6: (10, 4, 14, 5)
- Cycle 7: (10, 4, 12, 13)
- Cycle 8: (10, 3, 9, 11)
- Cycle 9: (5, 14, 2, 6)
- Cycle 10: (5, 14, 0, 7)
- Cycle 11: (5, 7, 1, 13)
- Cycle 12: (5, 7, 11, 9)
- Cycle 13: (6, 8, 2, 14)
- Cycle 14: (6, 8, 1, 7)
- Cycle 15: (6, 8, 9, 3)
- Cycle 16: (2, 14, 0, 7)
- Cycle 17: (2, 14, 5, 13)
- Cycle 18: (2, 6, 0, 7)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges):
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (8, 6), 7>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is [1] unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Here is the unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, (8, 6), 7>
