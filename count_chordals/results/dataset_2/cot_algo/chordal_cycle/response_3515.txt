Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 20) (17, 16) (17, 19) (3, 9) (3, 29) (25, 5) (25, 26) (25, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 21) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 11) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 4) (29, 10) (4, 25) (4, 29) (4, 15) (7, 20) (7, 23) (15, 4) (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 21) (20, 14) (20, 7) (20, 15) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 12) (28, 6) (28, 16) (19, 17) (19, 29) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 25) (26, 8) (26, 15) (26, 19) (26, 23) (16, 17) (16, 28) (16, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 27) (9, 12) (10, 29) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 11) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 5) (23, 7) (23, 26) (23, 1) (23, 0) (11, 2) (11, 21) (11, 18) (18, 9) (18, 24) (18, 11) (5, 25) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 22) (1, 16) (1, 23) (1, 0) (0, 13) (0, 24) (0, 23) (0, 1) (0, 12) (27, 19) (27, 9) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (22, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (15, 26, 25, 4, 15)
        - Cycle 2: (15, 26, 25, 5, 2, 11, 21, 15)
        - Cycle 3: (15, 4, 29, 19, 26, 15)
        - Cycle 4: (15, 21, 8, 26, 15)
        - Cycle 5: (15, 21, 8, 13, 0, 24, 5, 2, 11, 21)
        - Cycle 6: (20, 15, 4, 29, 19, 17, 16, 1, 23, 7, 20)
        - Cycle 7: (20, 15, 26, 19, 29, 4, 15)
        - Cycle 8: (20, 15, 26, 23, 7, 20)
        - Cycle 9: (20, 15, 26, 25, 4, 15)
        - Cycle 10: (20, 6, 28, 16, 17, 19, 29, 10, 20)
        - Cycle 11: (20, 6, 28, 16, 17, 19, 29, 4, 15, 20)
        - Cycle 12: (22, 5, 25, 26, 19, 17, 16, 1, 23, 0, 22)
        - Cycle 13: (22, 5, 25, 26, 19, 29, 10, 22)
        - Cycle 14: (22, 5, 24, 0, 23, 1, 16, 17, 19, 29, 10, 22)
        - Cycle 15: (23, 1, 16, 17, 19, 26, 8, 21, 11, 2, 5, 24, 23)
        - Cycle 16: (23, 1, 16, 17, 19, 29, 4, 15, 21, 11, 2, 5, 24, 23)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - <20, 15, 26, 25, 4, 15> has chord (25, 4)
        - <20, 15, 26, 23, 7, 20> has chord (26, 23)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

        There are [2] chordal 4-cycles found.
