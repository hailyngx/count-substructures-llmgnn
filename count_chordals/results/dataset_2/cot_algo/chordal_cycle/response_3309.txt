Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 11) (15, 12) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 2) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 0) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 1) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 2) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 14) (1, 0) (18, 12) (18, 0) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 10, 17, 8, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 19, 13, 5, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 14, 6, 12, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 0, 8, 17, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 14, 6, 12, 18, 0, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 0, 18, 12, 6, 14, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 19, 13, 0, 18, 12, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 5, 13, 19, 1)
- Cycle 9: (2, 3, 5, 8, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 9, 17, 10, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 3, 10, 17, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 9, 16, 12, 6, 14, 1, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 3, 10, 1, 14, 6, 12, 2)
- Cycle 14: (3, 10, 17, 12, 6, 14, 1, 3)
- Cycle 15: (3, 5, 13, 19, 11, 16, 12, 3)
- Cycle 16: (3, 2, 9, 16, 11, 19, 13, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 10, 17, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 19, 13, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 14, 6, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 0, 8, 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 3, 5, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <2, 9, 17, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, 10, 17, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <3, 5, 13, 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [8].
