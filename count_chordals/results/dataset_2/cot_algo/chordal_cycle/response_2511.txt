Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph (nodes are labeled from 0 to 14):
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 0, 10, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 8, 2, 3, 6, 7, 13, 11, 12, 9)
- Cycle 3: (4, 12, 0, 1, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 13, 2, 8, 9, 14, 10, 0, 6, 7)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has the chord (1, 10)
- Cycle 2 has the chord (8, 6)
- Cycle 3 has the chord (12, 4)
- Cycle 4 has the chord (13, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
