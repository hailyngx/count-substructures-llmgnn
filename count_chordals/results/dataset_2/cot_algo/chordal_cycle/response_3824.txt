Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (19, 5) (19, 11) (8, 9) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 18) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 16) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 7) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 0) (6, 15) (6, 14) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 6, 14) 
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (3, 15, 2, 4)
- Cycle 4: (15, 5, 4, 2)
- Cycle 5: (15, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 6: (5, 9, 8, 13)
- Cycle 7: (5, 9, 13, 14)
- Cycle 8: (9, 14, 13, 17)
- Cycle 9: (9, 14, 6, 15)
- Cycle 10: (14, 17, 13, 16)
- Cycle 11: (10, 11, 7, 17)
- Cycle 12: (10, 11, 19, 5)
- Cycle 13: (11, 19, 5, 16)
- Cycle 14: (19, 13, 17, 7)
- Cycle 15: (8, 9, 13, 14)
- Cycle 16: (13, 17, 7, 16)
- Cycle 17: (13, 17, 16, 5)
- Cycle 18: (2, 15, 6, 14)
- Cycle 19: (2, 15, 4, 5)
- Cycle 20: (2, 15, 4, 1)
- Cycle 21: (15, 6, 14, 17)
- Cycle 22: (15, 4, 5, 16)
- Cycle 23: (15, 4, 1, 0)
- Cycle 24: (5, 4, 2, 0)
- Cycle 25: (5, 4, 1, 0)
- Cycle 26: (5, 16, 13, 18)
- Cycle 27: (9, 13, 18, 10)
- Cycle 28: (14, 13, 18, 10)
- Cycle 29: (17, 13, 18, 10)
- Cycle 30: (17, 13, 18, 10)
- Cycle 31: (17, 7, 11, 19)
- Cycle 32: (16, 5, 19, 11)
- Cycle 33: (16, 7, 17, 13)
- Cycle 34: (2, 4, 1, 0)
- Cycle 35: (6, 14, 17, 7)
- Cycle 36: (4, 5, 16, 7)
- Cycle 37: (4, 1, 0, 2)
- Cycle 38: (18, 13, 16, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (2, 4), 15>
- <1, (4, 5), 15>
- <1, (4, 0), 15>
- <5, (9, 13), 14>
- <5, (16, 7), 17>
- <10, (11, 19), 5>
- <13, (17, 7), 16>
- <2, (0, 1), 4>
- <6, (14, 17), 15>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
