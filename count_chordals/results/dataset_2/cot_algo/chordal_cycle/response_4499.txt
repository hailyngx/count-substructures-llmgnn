Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 0) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 15) (18, 4) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 19) (0, 17) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 16) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 10) (16, 19) (16, 9) (16, 10) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 16) (2, 15) (2, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (3, 11, 2, 15)
- Cycle 2: (3, 11, 5, 7)
- Cycle 3: (3, 5, 8, 15)
- Cycle 4: (3, 12, 7, 5)
- Cycle 5: (15, 8, 19, 10)
- Cycle 6: (15, 18, 4, 6)
- Cycle 7: (3, 9, 13, 12)
- Cycle 8: (14, 6, 10, 19)
- Cycle 9: (17, 1, 13, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (3, 11), 2, 15>
- <2, (3, 5), 8, 15>
- <3, (3, 12), 7, 5>
- <4, (15, 8), 19, 10>
- <5, (15, 18), 4, 6>
- <6, (3, 9), 13, 12>
- <7, (14, 6), 10, 19>
- <8, (17, 1), 13, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [8].
