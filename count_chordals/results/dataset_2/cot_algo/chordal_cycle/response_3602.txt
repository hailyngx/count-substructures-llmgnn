Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 1-5-8-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-3-0-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-9-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-8-2-1
- Cycle 5: 2-9-4-3-2
- Cycle 6: 3-5-9-4-3
- Cycle 7: 3-7-0-6-3
- Cycle 8: 3-7-9-2-3
- Cycle 9: 5-9-4-3-5
- Cycle 10: 5-9-7-0-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From Cycle 9: 5-9-4-3-5, the chord candidates are (5,4) and (9,3). Checking these chords, we find that (5,4) is the only chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is only 1 chordless 4-cycle in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1], and the unique chordal 4-cycle is <5-9-4-3>.
