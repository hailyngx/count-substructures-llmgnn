Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 4) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more using the given edges:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-2-6-5-4-10-0
- Cycle 2: 1-2-0-14-8-9-7-1
- Cycle 3: 4-14-0-10-6-5-4
- Cycle 4: 1-12-3-2-0-10-6-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8>
- Cycle 3: <4, 10>
- Cycle 4: <1, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6>, 2, 5, 4, 10, 3
- Cycle 2: <0, 8>, 9, 7, 1, 12, 14
- Cycle 3: <4, 10>, 6, 5, 0, 14
- Cycle 4: <1, 2>, 0, 3, 12, 10
