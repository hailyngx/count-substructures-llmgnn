Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
Here are the cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. (5, 9, 0, 6, 5)
2. (5, 1, 7, 8, 5)
3. (5, 3, 0, 9, 5)
4. (9, 8, 7, 0, 9)
5. (9, 3, 7, 1, 9)
6. (4, 2, 6, 0, 4)
7. (8, 6, 0, 9, 8)
8. (8, 7, 3, 0, 8)
9. (6, 2, 4, 0, 6)
10. (0, 7, 1, 5, 0)
11. (7, 1, 2, 4, 7)
12. (3, 1, 7, 0, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. (5, 9, 0, 6, 5) - Chord: (0, 6)
2. (5, 1, 7, 8, 5) - Chord: (1, 8)
3. (5, 3, 0, 9, 5) - Chord: (0, 9)
4. (9, 8, 7, 0, 9) - Chord: (7, 8)
5. (9, 3, 7, 1, 9) - Chord: (1, 7)
6. (4, 2, 6, 0, 4) - Chord: (2, 6)
7. (8, 6, 0, 9, 8) - Chord: (0, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<5, 9, 0, 6> (Chord: (0, 6))
<5, 1, 7, 8> (Chord: (1, 8))
<5, 3, 0, 9> (Chord: (0, 9))
<9, 8, 7, 0> (Chord: (7, 8))
<9, 3, 7, 1> (Chord: (1, 7))
<4, 2, 6, 0> (Chord: (2, 6))
<8, 6, 0, 9> (Chord: (0, 9))
