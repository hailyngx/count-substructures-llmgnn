Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 27) (26, 16) (15, 27) (15, 4) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 19) (2, 22) (2, 1) (29, 17) (29, 8) (29, 14) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 25) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 21) (23, 14) (17, 29) (17, 10) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 29) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 12) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 24) (6, 4) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 18) (25, 11) (25, 24) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 3) (24, 5) (24, 25) (24, 19) (7, 16) (7, 28) (16, 26) (16, 7) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 18) (19, 27) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 24) (19, 1) (14, 29) (14, 11) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 3) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 7) (28, 1) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 18) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 28) (21, 22) (21, 18) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

Cycles of length 4:
- <4, 12, 10, 13, 4>
- <4, 8, 28, 1, 4>
- <4, 6, 18, 21, 4>
- <8, 28, 1, 2, 8>
- <8, 12, 10, 11, 8>
- <8, 12, 18, 6, 8>
- <10, 11, 25, 24, 10>
- <10, 17, 29, 14, 10>
- <11, 14, 29, 17, 11>
- <14, 29, 17, 10, 14>
- <18, 6, 4, 15, 18>
- <19, 27, 9, 27, 19>
- <19, 27, 15, 4, 19>
- <19, 1, 2, 22, 19>
- <19, 24, 5, 4, 19>
- <20, 14, 3, 13, 20>
- <20, 6, 4, 15, 20>
- <22, 2, 1, 19, 22>
- <22, 19, 27, 9, 22>
- <22, 21, 18, 6, 22>
- <24, 5, 4, 15, 24>
- <24, 25, 11, 10, 24>
- <28, 1, 2, 22, 28>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycles: <4, 12, (10, 13), 4>, <8, 28, (1, 2), 8>, <10, 11, (25, 24), 10>, <14, 29, (17, 10), 14>, <19, 27, (9, 22), 19>, <20, 14, (3, 13), 20>, <22, 2, (1, 19), 22>, <24, 25, (11, 10), 24>, <28, 1, (2, 22), 28>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [9]

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
