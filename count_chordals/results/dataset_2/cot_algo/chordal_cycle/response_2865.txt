Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

The cycles in the graph are:
1. Cycle: <0, 2, 4, 7, 6> 
2. Cycle: <1, 2, 4, 7, 6> 
3. Cycle: <3, 1, 7, 6> 
4. Cycle: <5, 1, 7, 6> 
5. Cycle: <8, 3, 1, 7, 6> 
6. Cycle: <9, 0, 2, 4, 7> 
7. Cycle: <9, 4, 2, 1, 3> 
8. Cycle: <9, 8, 5, 1, 7> 
9. Cycle: <9, 7, 1, 3> 
10. Cycle: <8, 3, 5, 1, 7> 
11. Cycle: <8, 5, 1, 3> 
12. Cycle: <5, 8, 2, 4, 7> 
13. Cycle: <5, 1, 3, 9> 
14. Cycle: <3, 9, 8, 6> 
15. Cycle: <2, 8, 6, 7> 
16. Cycle: <2, 1, 7, 6> 
17. Cycle: <4, 7, 1, 5> 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle). 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<9, 0, 2, 4, 7>, with chord (9, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [16] chordless cycles.
