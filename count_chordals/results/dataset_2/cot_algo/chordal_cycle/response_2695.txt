Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 3) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 4) (20, 23) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 0) (15, 20) (6, 25) (6, 27) (6, 0) (28, 1) (28, 27) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 27) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 17) (13, 14) (24, 2) (24, 26) (24, 14) (26, 2) (26, 24) (26, 21) (26, 0) (26, 4) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 21) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 22) (7, 18) (21, 26) (21, 17) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 26) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 14) (23, 20) (23, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 18) (14, 16) (22, 12) (22, 1) (10, 27) (27, 6) (27, 28) (27, 11) (27, 10) (1, 28) (1, 9) (1, 23) (1, 22) (16, 3) (16, 14) (19, 3) (19, 9) (4, 20) (4, 26) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 2-29-3-12-2
- Cycle 2: 2-8-0-26-2
- Cycle 3: 2-12-5-14-2
- Cycle 4: 2-24-26-4-2
- Cycle 5: 29-3-11-27-29
- Cycle 6: 20-25-6-0-20
- Cycle 7: 20-15-4-23-20
- Cycle 8: 25-6-27-28-25
- Cycle 9: 15-20-23-1-15
- Cycle 10: 11-3-12-9-11
- Cycle 11: 6-25-0-8-6
- Cycle 12: 17-9-1-23-17
- Cycle 13: 5-12-3-19-5
- Cycle 14: 24-26-21-17-24
- Cycle 15: 18-11-3-16-18
- Cycle 16: 14-5-12-22-14
- Cycle 17: 22-12-2-29-22
- Cycle 18: 10-27-6-0-10
- Cycle 19: 1-28-27-11-1
- Cycle 20: 16-3-19-9-16

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (9, 17), 23>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (12, 3), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (11, 27), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (26, 2), 24>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (5, 12), 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (25, 0), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (18, 11), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (0, 26), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (17, 9), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (27, 6), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <11, (3, 12), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <12, (2, 29), 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <13, (14, 5), 22>

Step 3:
Therefore, the total number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [13].
