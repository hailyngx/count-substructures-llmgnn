Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 9) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 5-6-12-3-5
- Cycle 2: 5-13-7-4-5
- Cycle 3: 5-13-14-9-5
- Cycle 4: 5-11-1-9-5
- Cycle 5: 6-5-13-9-6
- Cycle 6: 6-12-8-14-6
- Cycle 7: 12-8-14-9-12
- Cycle 8: 13-5-11-1-13
- Cycle 9: 13-7-4-0-13
- Cycle 10: 13-9-14-2-13
- Cycle 11: 0-4-7-14-0
- Cycle 12: 0-8-14-9-0
- Cycle 13: 1-11-5-3-1
- Cycle 14: 1-9-14-8-1
- Cycle 15: 9-13-7-4-9
- Cycle 16: 9-14-8-3-9
- Cycle 17: 3-12-6-10-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 is chordal with chord <5, 3>
- Cycle 2 is chordal with chord <5, 7>
- Cycle 3 is chordal with chord <13, 5>
- Cycle 4 is chordal with chord <9, 5>
- Cycle 5 is chordal with chord <13, 9>
- Cycle 6 is chordal with chord <6, 12>
- Cycle 7 is chordal with chord <8, 12>
- Cycle 8 is chordal with chord <13, 11>
- Cycle 9 is chordal with chord <4, 13>
- Cycle 10 is chordal with chord <13, 14>
- Cycle 11 is chordal with chord <4, 0>
- Cycle 12 is chordal with chord <14, 8>
- Cycle 13 is chordal with chord <11, 5>
- Cycle 14 is chordal with chord <9, 14>
- Cycle 15 is chordal with chord <4, 9>
- Cycle 16 is chordal with chord <8, 14>
- Cycle 17 is chordal with chord <6, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
