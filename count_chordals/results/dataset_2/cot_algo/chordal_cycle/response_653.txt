Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 3) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (14, 8) (14, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 9, 11)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 11, 13)
- Cycle 3: (7, 9, 11, 13)
- Cycle 4: (0, 3, 7, 9)
- Cycle 5: (0, 3, 10, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 9), 5> in Cycle 1
- <2, (4, 11), 1> in Cycle 2
- <3, (7, 13), 11> in Cycle 3
- <4, (0, 9), 10> in Cycle 4
- Cycle 5 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [1].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (4, 9), 5>, and the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
