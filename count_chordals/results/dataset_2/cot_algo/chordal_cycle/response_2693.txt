Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 4, 0, 7, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 2, 8, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 2, 8, 9, 6, 4, 0, 7, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 0, 4, 5, 3, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 0, 4, 6, 9, 8, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 7, 0, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 4, 0, 7, 3, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 5, 3, 1, 7, 0, 8, 2>
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 1, 7, 0, 4, 6, 9, 8, 3>
- Cycle 11: <3, 5, 2, 8, 1, 7, 0, 4, 6, 9, 3>
- Cycle 12: <3, 7, 0, 4, 5, 2, 8, 3>
- Cycle 13: <3, 7, 0, 4, 6, 9, 8, 3>
- Cycle 14: <4, 5, 1, 7, 0, 6, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 15: <5, 1, 7, 0, 4, 6, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 16: <6, 9, 8, 0, 7, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6>
- Cycle 17: <8, 9, 6, 4, 0, 7, 3, 8>
- Cycle 18: <8, 9, 6, 4, 5, 2, 8>
- Cycle 19: <8, 9, 6, 0, 4, 5, 3, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (4, 6), 0>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph, so the final count is [1].
