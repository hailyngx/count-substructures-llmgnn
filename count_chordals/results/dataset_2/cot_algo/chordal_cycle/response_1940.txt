- Cycle 8: 7-13-0-10-7
- Cycle 9: 0-13-1-11-0
- Cycle 10: 0-13-2-3-0
- Cycle 11: 0-3-4-14-0

- Cycle 24: 11-6-4-3-11
- Cycle 25: 11-0-10-6-11
- Cycle 26: 11-1-13-2-11
- Cycle 27: 14-4-6-10-14
- Cycle 28: 14-7-9-6-14
- Cycle 29: 2-9-7-13-2
- Cycle 30: 2-13-1-8-2
- Cycle 31: 12-10-6-4-12
- Cycle 32: 12-14-8-3-12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, (7, 9), 6>
- <5, (7, 9), 1>
- <5, (7, 9), 14>
- <9, (6, 4), 14>
- <9, (7, 14), 8>
- <4, (6, 10), 0>
- <4, (6, 11), 2>
- <7, (13, 0), 10>
- <0, (13, 1), 11>
- <0, (13, 2), 3>
- <0, (3, 4), 14>
- <0, (3, 8), 1>
- <0, (10, 12), 14>
- <6, (10, 0), 13>
- <6, (10, 3), 2>
- <7, (9, 1), 13>
- <4, (14, 8), 1>
- <13, (1, 8), 3>
- <13, (2, 3), 10>
- <3, (4, 6), 9>
- <3, (2, 9), 7>
- <1, (9, 7), 5>
- <1, (8, 3), 2>
- <11, (6, 4), 3>
- <11, (0, 10), 6>
- <11, (1, 13), 2>
- <14, (4, 6), 10>
- <14, (7, 9), 6>
- <2, (9, 7), 13>
- <2, (13, 1), 8>
- <12, (10, 6), 4>
- <12, (14, 8), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 32 cycles found in total, out of which 32 cycles have exactly one chord.
- Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].
