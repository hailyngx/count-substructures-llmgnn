Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 7-12-13-6-7
- Cycle 2: 14-13-6-14
- Cycle 3: 9-13-6-9
- Cycle 4: 4-9-13-14-4
- Cycle 5: 4-9-0-6-4
- Cycle 6: 4-9-13-12-7-4
- Cycle 7: 8-6-13-9-8
- Cycle 8: 8-6-13-12-7-8
- Cycle 9: 8-6-0-9-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord <7, 13>
- Cycle 2: Chord <14, 6>
- Cycle 3: Chord <9, 6>
- Cycle 4: Chord <9, 13>
- Cycle 5: Chord <9, 6>
- Cycle 6: No chord
- Cycle 7: Chord <6, 9>
- Cycle 8: No chord
- Cycle 9: Chord <6, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordless cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <4, 13, 14, 9>
