Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 8, 3, 7, 9)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 2, 8, 0)
- Cycle 4: (6, 8, 3, 7, 6)
- Cycle 5: (4, 1, 0, 3, 4)

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycle is:
- Chordal 4-Cycle 1: <5, (4, 1), 2, 5>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 2: <9, (8, 3), 7, 9>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 3: <0, (1, 8), 2, 0>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 4: <6, (8, 3), 7, 6>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 5: <4, (1, 3), 0, 4>

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [5].
