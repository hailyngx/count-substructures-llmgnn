Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 25) (16, 10) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 5) (22, 18) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 7) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 14) (26, 29) (26, 0) (26, 12) (4, 18) (28, 0) (28, 24) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 13) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 25) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 23) (23, 9) (23, 19) (12, 26) (12, 24) (12, 17) (6, 11) (6, 24) (24, 22) (24, 28) (24, 12) (24, 6) (24, 10) (19, 15) (19, 23) (19, 17) (19, 13) (0, 26) (0, 28) (0, 9) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 2) (17, 8) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 3) (17, 5) (7, 22) (7, 29) (7, 8) (2, 3) (2, 14) (20, 22) (20, 21) (21, 20) (21, 5) (10, 16) (10, 24) (10, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (27, 18) (27, 8) (13, 29) (13, 19) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 21) (25, 11) (25, 16) (25, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- <11, 16, 25, 15>
- <18, 22, 24, 4>
- <1, 22, 18, 5>
- <26, 29, 13, 19>
- <8, 15, 25, 11>
- <8, 15, 19, 13>
- <8, 15, 19, 17>
- <9, 8, 15, 25>
- <9, 8, 15, 19>
- <9, 8, 17, 19>
- <23, 9, 8, 17>
- <23, 9, 0, 26>
- <17, 12, 24, 22>
- <17, 12, 24, 10>
- <17, 12, 26, 29>
- <17, 3, 0, 26>
- <17, 3, 0, 28>
- <2, 3, 0, 26>
- <2, 3, 0, 28>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordless cycles: <11, 16, 25, 15>, <8, 15, 19, 13>, <9, 8, 17, 19>, <17, 12, 24, 22>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = 4

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
