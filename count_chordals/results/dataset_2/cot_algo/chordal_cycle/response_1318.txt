Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle <0, 6, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle <0, 6, 3, 12, 2>
- Cycle <0, 6, 10, 1, 2>
- Cycle <0, 6, 10, 4, 13>
- Cycle <1, 10, 4, 13, 8>
- Cycle <1, 10, 6, 3, 12>
- Cycle <1, 10, 6, 4, 7>
- Cycle <1, 10, 6, 4, 13>
- Cycle <2, 0, 6, 4, 7>
- Cycle <2, 0, 6, 10, 1>
- Cycle <2, 0, 6, 10, 4>
- Cycle <3, 6, 10, 1, 2>
- Cycle <3, 6, 10, 4, 7>
- Cycle <3, 6, 10, 4, 13>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- The cycle <0, 6, 4, 7, 2> has a chord (6, 2).
- The cycle <0, 6, 3, 12, 2> has a chord (12, 0).
- The cycle <0, 6, 10, 1, 2> has a chord (6, 1).
- The cycle <0, 6, 10, 4, 13> has a chord (13, 4).
- The cycle <1, 10, 4, 13, 8> has a chord (10, 4).
- The cycle <1, 10, 6, 3, 12> has a chord (10, 3).
- The cycle <1, 10, 6, 4, 7> has a chord (1, 7).
- The cycle <2, 0, 6, 4, 7> has a chord (0, 4).
- The cycle <2, 0, 6, 10, 1> has a chord (0, 10).
- The cycle <3, 6, 10, 1, 2> has a chord (6, 1).
- The cycle <3, 6, 10, 4, 7> has a chord (6, 7).
- The cycle <3, 6, 10, 4, 13> has a chord (10, 13).

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [12]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<0, 6, 4, 7, (6, 2)>
<0, 6, 3, 12, (12, 0)>
<0, 6, 10, 1, (6, 1)>
<0, 6, 10, 4, (13, 4)>
<1, 10, 4, 13, (10, 4)>
<1, 10, 6, 3, (10, 3)>
<1, 10, 6, 4, (1, 7)>
<2, 0, 6, 4, (0, 4)>
<2, 0, 6, 10, (0, 10)>
<3, 6, 10, 1, (6, 1)>
<3, 6, 10, 4, (6, 7)>
<3, 6, 10, 4, (10, 13)>
