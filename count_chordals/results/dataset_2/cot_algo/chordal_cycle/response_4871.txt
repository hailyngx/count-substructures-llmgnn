Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 20) (10, 19) (10, 24) (10, 5) (19, 10) (19, 29) (19, 1) (26, 13) (26, 17) (13, 16) (13, 26) (13, 21) (8, 16) (8, 17) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 12) (23, 11) (23, 7) (21, 13) (21, 4) (21, 22) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 25) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 6) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 20) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 15) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 24) (7, 23) (7, 3) (7, 27) (7, 17) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 15) (5, 0) (0, 5) (20, 16) (20, 3) (20, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 15) (29, 19) (15, 28) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 22) (22, 21) (22, 5) (22, 15) (27, 7) (25, 4) (25, 2) (25, 18) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 7) (17, 24) (17, 18) (24, 10) (24, 14) (24, 17) (18, 12) (18, 25) (18, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- Cycle: 2-9-4-21-2
- Cycle: 2-9-12-6-2

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle <2, 9, 4, 21, 2> has a chord (4, 21) so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle <2, 9, 12, 6, 2> has a chord (9, 6) so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
There are no chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
