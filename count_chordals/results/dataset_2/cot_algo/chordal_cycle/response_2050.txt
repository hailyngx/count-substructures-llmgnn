Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 2, 6, 13)
- Cycle 2: (1, 0, 2, 6)
- Cycle 3: (1, 2, 0, 10)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 10, 4)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 8, 13)
- Cycle 6: (1, 3, 11, 6)
- Cycle 7: (1, 3, 11, 7)
- Cycle 8: (2, 6, 11, 7)
- Cycle 9: (2, 6, 13, 12)
- Cycle 10: (2, 12, 13, 5)
- Cycle 11: (3, 8, 2, 6)
- Cycle 12: (3, 8, 7, 11)
- Cycle 13: (4, 8, 3, 10)
- Cycle 14: (6, 11, 7, 12)
- Cycle 15: (7, 8, 3, 11)
- Cycle 16: (10, 4, 8, 3)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (2, 6), 13>
- Cycle 2: <1, (0, 2), 6>
- Cycle 3: <1, (10, 0), 2>
- Cycle 4: <1, (3, 10), 4>
- Cycle 5: <1, (8, 13), 3>
- Cycle 6: <1, (3, 11), 6>
- Cycle 7: <1, (3, 11), 7>
- Cycle 8: <2, (7, 11), 6>
- Cycle 9: <2, (12, 13), 6>
- Cycle 10: <5, (2, 13), 12>
- Cycle 11: <3, (8, 2), 6>
- Cycle 12: <3, (8, 7), 11>
- Cycle 13: <4, (8, 3), 10>
- Cycle 14: <7, (8, 12), 11>
- Cycle 15: <7, (11, 3), 8>
- Cycle 16: <10, (4, 8), 3>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, it is [16].
