Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 11) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 2 - 13 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 9 - 11 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 9 - 7 - 10 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 7 - 10 - 12 - 6
- Cycle 5: 6 - 7 - 0 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 6: 6 - 7 - 0 - 14 - 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1: <6, 2, 9, 13> (Possible chords: (6, 9) and (2, 13))
- Cycle 2: <6, 5, 11, 9> (Possible chords: (6, 9) and (5, 11))
- Cycle 3: <6, 10, 7, 9> (Possible chords: (6, 9) and (7, 10))
- Cycle 4: <6, 12, 10, 7> (Possible chords: (6, 7) and (10, 12))
- Cycle 5: <6, 1, 0, 7> (Possible chords: (6, 7) and (0, 1))
- Cycle 6: <6, 14, 0, 7> (Possible chords: (6, 7) and (0, 14))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
