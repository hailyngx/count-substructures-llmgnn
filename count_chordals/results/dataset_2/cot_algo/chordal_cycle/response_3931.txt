Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Here are the cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 1 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 2: 5 - 0 - 4 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 7 - 6 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 4: 9 - 1 - 8 - 2 - 9
- Cycle 5: 9 - 0 - 4 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 6: 4 - 2 - 8 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 7: 8 - 1 - 9 - 7 - 8
- Cycle 8: 6 - 5 - 7 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 9: 2 - 4 - 6 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 10: 3 - 9 - 7 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 11: 7 - 5 - 0 - 3 - 7
- Cycle 12: 0 - 5 - 1 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 13: 1 - 2 - 6 - 7 - 1


Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has a chord (0, 4) 
- Cycle 3 has a chord (5, 4) 
- Cycle 5 has a chord (0, 6) 
- Cycle 6 has a chord (2, 7) 
- Cycle 10 has a chord (9, 7) 


Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we find that there are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<2, (0, 4)>
<3, (5, 4)>
<5, (0, 6)>
<6, (2, 7)>
<10, (9, 7)>
