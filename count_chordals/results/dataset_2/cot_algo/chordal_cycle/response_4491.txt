Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 1-5-8-0-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-2-5-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-2-7-3-1
- Cycle 4: 2-7-3-6-2
- Cycle 5: 3-6-4-0-3
- Cycle 6: 4-6-2-5-4
- Cycle 7: 6-3-7-9-5-6
- Cycle 8: 6-3-1-5-6
- Cycle 9: 6-4-2-7-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1: 1-5-8-0-1 has chord 5-8
- Cycle 2: 1-6-2-5-1 has chord 6-5
- Cycle 3: 1-6-2-7-3-1 has chord 6-3
- Cycle 4: 2-7-3-6-2 has chord 7-6
- Cycle 5: 3-6-4-0-3 has chord 6-0
- Cycle 6: 4-6-2-5-4 has chord 6-5
- Cycle 7: 6-3-7-9-5-6 doesn't have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 8: 6-3-1-5-6 doesn't have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 9: 6-4-2-7-6 has chord 4-7

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
We found 6 chordal 4-cycles in total.
Therefore, the final answer is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, 5-8, 0-1>
<2-7, 3-6, 2>
<3-6, 4-0, 3>
<4, 6-2, 5>
<1, 6-2, 7-3, 1>
<6-4, 2-7, 6>
