Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 8, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 6, 4, 9)
- Cycle 4: (6, 1, 0, 6)
- Cycle 5: (1, 8, 3, 1)
- Cycle 6: (3, 4, 6, 3)
- Cycle 7: (4, 0, 1, 4)
- Cycle 8: (0, 8, 5, 0)
- Cycle 9: (8, 1, 6, 8)
- Cycle 10: (6, 7, 1, 6)
- Cycle 11: (2, 9, 3, 2)
- Cycle 12: (6, 9, 8, 6)
- Cycle 13: (0, 4, 6, 0)
- Cycle 14: (1, 7, 6, 1)
- Cycle 15: (3, 8, 9, 3)
- Cycle 16: (8, 0, 1, 8)
- Cycle 17: (4, 3, 9, 4)
- Cycle 18: (7, 1, 6, 7)
- Cycle 19: (9, 8, 1, 9)
- Cycle 20: (2, 0, 4, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <1, (8, 5),  3>
- <1, (8, 7),  1>
- <6, (9, 4), 6>
- <6, (1, 0),  6>
- <8, (9, 1),  8>
- <0, (4, 6),  0>
- <1, (6, 7),  1>
- <3, (9, 8),  3>
- <8, (1, 0),  8>
- <4, (9, 3),  4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 10 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final answer is [10].
