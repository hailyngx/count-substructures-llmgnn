Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are 6 cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. Cycle 1: 5-2-6-1-5
2. Cycle 2: 5-1-4-6-5
3. Cycle 3: 5-4-9-7-5
4. Cycle 4: 5-8-4-9-5
5. Cycle 5: 5-1-3-9-5
6. Cycle 6: 5-2-4-8-5

Step 2: 
- Checking for a chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle 1 has a chord (2, 6)
2. Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 4)
3. Cycle 3 has a chord (4, 7)
4. Cycle 4 has a chord (8, 4)
5. Cycle 5 is chordal (1, 9)
6. Cycle 6 is chordal (2, 8)

Step 3: 
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, (1, 4), 6>
- <5, (2, 8), 4>
