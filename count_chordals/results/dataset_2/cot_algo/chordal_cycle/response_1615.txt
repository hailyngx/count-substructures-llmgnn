Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle <1, 4, 3, 8, 1>
- Cycle <1, 4, 8, 5, 1>
- Cycle <1, 2, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle <1, 6, 0, 7, 1>
- Cycle <2, 4, 3, 8, 2>
- Cycle <2, 4, 8, 5, 2>
- Cycle <2, 5, 8, 6, 2>
- Cycle <2, 7, 0, 6, 2>
- Cycle <2, 9, 1, 7, 2>
- Cycle <3, 4, 8, 6, 3>
- Cycle <4, 8, 3, 4, 2>
- Cycle <4, 8, 5, 2, 4>
- Cycle <6, 8, 5, 2, 6>
- Cycle <7, 0, 6, 2, 7>
- Cycle <7, 1, 2, 6, 7>
- Cycle <8, 3, 4, 1, 8>
- Cycle <8, 4, 1, 9, 8>
- Cycle <8, 5, 2, 1, 8>
- Cycle <8, 6, 0, 7, 8>
- Cycle <9, 1, 7, 0, 9>
- Cycle <9, 2, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle <9, 8, 5, 2, 9>

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
- <1, 4, 3, (8, 5), 1>
- <1, 4, (8, 5), 1, 2>
- <1, 2, 5, (8, 6), 2>
- <1, 6, (0, 7), 1>
- <2, 4, (3, 8), 2>
- <2, 4, (8, 5), 2>
- <2, 5, (8, 6), 2>
- <2, 7, (0, 6), 2>
- <2, 9, 1, (7, 0), 2>
- <3, 4, (8, 6), 3>
- <4, 8, (5, 2), 4>
- <6, 8, (5, 2), 6>
- <7, 0, (6, 2), 7>
- <7, 1, 2, (6, 0), 7>
- <8, 3, 4, (1, 9), 8>
- <8, 5, 2, 1, (8, 6)>
- <8, 6, (0, 7), 8>
- <9, 1, (7, 0), 9>
- <9, 2, 4, (3, 8), 9>

Step 3: 
There are [18] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
