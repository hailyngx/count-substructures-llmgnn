Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 14) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 5) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 15) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (9, 11) (9, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 14) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 18) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 18) (7, 1) (7, 3) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 15) (19, 0) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 16) (6, 4) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 18) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 6) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle: (1, 11, 4, 3, 7, 1)
2. Cycle: (1, 11, 9, 8, 1)
3. Cycle: (1, 11, 4, 6, 16, 8, 1)
4. Cycle: (1, 11, 4, 6, 16, 14, 2, 1)
5. Cycle: (1, 11, 4, 3, 18, 14, 2, 1)
6. Cycle: (1, 11, 9, 8, 17, 15, 19, 0, 12, 10, 5, 2, 1)
7. Cycle: (1, 11, 9, 8, 17, 15, 19, 0, 5, 10, 12, 18, 14, 2, 1)
8. Cycle: (1, 11, 9, 8, 17, 15, 19, 0, 5, 2, 14, 18, 3, 4, 11)
9. Cycle: (1, 11, 4, 3, 18, 14, 5, 0, 12, 10, 17, 8, 1)
10. Cycle: (1, 11, 9, 8, 17, 15, 19, 0, 5, 14, 2, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- In cycle 6, the chord is between vertices 1 and 8.
- In cycle 7, the chord is between vertices 5 and 18.
- In cycle 10, the chord is between vertices 11 and 9.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (11, 9), 8, 17, 15, 19, 0, 5, 2, 14, 18, 3, 4>
<1, (5, 18), 14, 2>
<1, (9, 11), 8>
