Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-9-2-1
- Cycle 2: 4-6-13-11-4
- Cycle 3: 4-6-8-10-4

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, only Cycle 3 has exactly one chord, which is the edge connecting nodes 8 and 10.

Step 3:
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final answer is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <4, (8, 10), 6>
