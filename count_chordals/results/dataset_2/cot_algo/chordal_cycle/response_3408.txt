Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-5-9-6-4
- Cycle 2: 3-5-9-1-3
- Cycle 3: 0-5-9-8-0
- Cycle 4: 2-5-9-8-2
- Cycle 5: 6-1-9-8-6
- Cycle 6: 7-4-9-1-7
- Cycle 7: 3-7-4-0-3
- Cycle 8: 2-7-4-0-2
- Cycle 9: 8-1-6-2-8
- Cycle 10: 5-0-7-2-5

Step 2:  
Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- <4, (5, 9), 6>
- <3, (5, 9), 1>
- <0, (5, 9), 8>
- <2, (5, 9), 8>
- <6, (1, 9), 8> 

Step 3:  
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
