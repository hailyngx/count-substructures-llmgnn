Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Based on the given edges, we can identify cycles of length 4 or more as follows:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-6-5-4
- Cycle 2: 4-8-0-3-4
- Cycle 3: 4-3-9-1-4
- Cycle 4: 4-5-2-6-4
- Cycle 5: 7-6-9-7
- Cycle 6: 7-9-3-7
- Cycle 7: 7-4-8-7
- Cycle 8: 6-5-2-6
- Cycle 9: 6-1-9-6
- Cycle 10: 6-2-5-6
- Cycle 11: 6-0-8-6
- Cycle 12: 9-7-4-9
- Cycle 13: 9-6-1-9
- Cycle 14: 9-3-0-9
- Cycle 15: 8-4-7-8
- Cycle 16: 8-3-0-8
- Cycle 17: 8-1-9-8
- Cycle 18: 5-4-1-5
- Cycle 19: 5-6-2-5
- Cycle 20: 5-1-9-5
- Cycle 21: 1-4-8-1
- Cycle 22: 1-6-9-1
- Cycle 23: 1-8-4-1
- Cycle 24: 1-5-4-1
- Cycle 25: 3-4-0-3
- Cycle 26: 3-9-7-3
- Cycle 27: 3-8-0-3
- Cycle 28: 2-5-6-2
- Cycle 29: 2-6-1-2
- Cycle 30: 0-8-4-0

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, (6, 7), 5> has one chord (6, 7)
- <4, (0, 8), 3> has one chord (0, 8)
- <4, (9, 1), 3> has one chord (9, 1)
- <4, (5, 2), 6> has one chord (5, 2)
- <7, (4, 8), 6> has one chord (4, 8)
- <6, (9, 1), 7> has one chord (9, 1)
- <9, (4, 8), 7> has one chord (4, 8)
- <8, (4, 7), 3> has one chord (4, 7)
- <5, (6, 2), 1> has one chord (6, 2)
- <1, (4, 8), 5> has one chord (4, 8)
- <3, (4, 8), 0> has one chord (4, 8)
- <0, (3, 8), 6> has one chord (3, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [12].
