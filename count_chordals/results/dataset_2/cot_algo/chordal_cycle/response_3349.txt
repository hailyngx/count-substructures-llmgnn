Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 18) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 11) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 14) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 18) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 19) (5, 17) (5, 8) (5, 11) (6, 15) (6, 16) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 16) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (13, 16) (13, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 2) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 13) (15, 6) (15, 9) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 16) (16, 6) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 10, 17, 5, 11, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 12, 9, 15, 6, 16, 18, 0, 3, 4, 10, 17, 8, 5, 11, 13, 16, 9, 12, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 4, 10, 17, 8, 14, 0, 18, 7, 11, 5, 17, 10, 1, 2, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (1, 17)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (3, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. As we didn't find any chordless cycle, the final count is [0].
