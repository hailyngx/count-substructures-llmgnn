Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-11-7-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-3-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-0-10-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-2-6-1
- Cycle 5: 4-9-1-6-4
- Cycle 6: 4-11-7-10-4
- Cycle 7: 7-11-5-8-7
- Cycle 8: 10-8-2-12-10
- Cycle 9: 10-0-6-1-10
- Cycle 10: 10-13-12-7-10
- Cycle 11: 11-5-8-2-11
- Cycle 12: 12-7-11-0-12
- Cycle 13: 13-1-9-4-13
- Cycle 14: 13-12-2-3-13
- Cycle 15: 13-0-14-9-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <1, (6, 3), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is only 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
