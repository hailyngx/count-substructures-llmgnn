Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0-6-4-9-0
- Cycle 2: 1-5-4-9-1
- Cycle 3: 3-4-5-1-3
- Cycle 4: 3-4-6-0-3
- Cycle 5: 3-7-6-0-3
- Cycle 6: 4-5-9-2-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord is (4, 9)
- Cycle 2: Chord is (1, 5)
- Cycle 3: Chord is (4, 5)
- Cycle 4: Chord is (0, 6)
- Cycle 5: Chord is (6, 7)
- Cycle 6: Chord is (9, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles, therefore the final count is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 6, 4, 9> with chord (4, 9)
- <1, 5, 4, 9> with chord (1, 5)
- <3, 4, 5, 1> with chord (4, 5)
- <3, 4, 6, 0> with chord (0, 6)
- <3, 7, 6, 0> with chord (6, 7)
- <4, 5, 9, 2> with chord (9, 2)
