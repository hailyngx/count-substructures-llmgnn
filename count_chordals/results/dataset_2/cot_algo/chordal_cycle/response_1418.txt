Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 22) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 23) (2, 16) (2, 28) (29, 25) (29, 23) (29, 4) (1, 3) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 20) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 27) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 8) (20, 9) (20, 11) (20, 0) (26, 1) (26, 7) (26, 17) (28, 2) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 8) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 21) (13, 24) (24, 13) (24, 7) (19, 5) (19, 3) (15, 0) (7, 26) (7, 24) (7, 16) (7, 17) (25, 29) (25, 12) (23, 9) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 27) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 22) (6, 17) (6, 18) (4, 29) (4, 1) (4, 22) (22, 5) (22, 16) (22, 4) (8, 0) (8, 28) (17, 26) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 27) (18, 6) (18, 12) (14, 27) (27, 21) (27, 23) (27, 17) (27, 14) (12, 3) (12, 25) (12, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 13, 21, 5)
- Cycle 2: (7, 27, 21, 1, 4, 22, 16, 7)
- Cycle 3: (7, 24, 13, 21, 28, 0, 8, 7)
- Cycle 4: (12, 25, 29, 4, 1, 3, 12)
- Cycle 5: (17, 26, 1, 3, 19, 5, 22, 4, 17)
- Cycle 6: (17, 27, 23, 29, 4, 22, 16, 7, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

From the listed cycles above, the following cycle has exactly one chord:

- <7, (24, 21), 13, 28, 0, 8, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <7, (24, 21), 13, 28, 0, 8, 7>, therefore the final number inside brackets is [1].
