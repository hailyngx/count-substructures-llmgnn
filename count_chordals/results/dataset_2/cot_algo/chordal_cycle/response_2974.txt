Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 16) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (3, 14) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 19) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 18) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (7, 11) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 1) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 19) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 7) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 5) (12, 19) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-14-17-16-5-12-19-3
- Cycle 2: 4-2-8-13-17-16-19-12-4
- Cycle 3: 4-2-8-11-9-10-15-3-18-6-19-12-4
- Cycle 4: 4-2-11-7-11-9-10-15-3-18-6-19-12-5-16-17-13-8-2-4

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:

In Cycle 1: 3-14-17-16-5-12-19-3, <5, 12> is the chord. This is a chordal 4-cycle.

In Cycle 2: 4-2-8-13-17-16-19-12-4, there is no chord.

In Cycle 3: 4-2-8-11-9-10-15-3-18-6-19-12-4, there is no chord.

In Cycle 4: 4-2-11-7-11-9-10-15-3-18-6-19-12-5-16-17-13-8-2-4, <2, 11> is the chord. This is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<3, 5, 12, 19>
<4, 2, 8, 11>
