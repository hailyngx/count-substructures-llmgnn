Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 4) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 13) (21, 7) (21, 17) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 24) (5, 3) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (7, 21) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 27) (6, 28) (6, 19) (6, 4) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 18) (19, 6) (19, 26) (19, 12) (26, 19) (26, 2) (26, 8) (24, 5) (24, 29) (17, 1) (17, 21) (17, 2) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 18) (8, 27) (3, 5) (25, 5) (25, 22) (25, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 17) (20, 5) (20, 8) (20, 14) (15, 11) (15, 22) (15, 23) (15, 14) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (29, 16) (29, 24) (18, 28) (18, 8) (18, 27) (18, 10) (27, 23) (27, 8) (27, 18) (27, 13) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 12) (10, 13) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 10) (14, 25) (14, 20) (14, 15) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-17-2-26-8-20-5-3
- Cycle 2: 1-17-21-7-21-17-2
- Cycle 3: 1-17-2-26-19-6-28-0
- Cycle 4: 1-13-27-23-15-14-25-5
- Cycle 5: 1-13-27-8-26-19-6-28
- Cycle 6: 1-13-27-8-18-10-9-5
- Cycle 7: 1-13-27-8-26-19-12-10
- Cycle 8: 15-14-25-22-23-27-13-1
- Cycle 9: 15-14-25-5-9-10-12-19
- Cycle 10: 15-14-25-5-20-8-27-23

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has the chord <6, 28>.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has the chord <6, 28>.
- Cycle 8 has no chord.
- Cycle 9 has no chord.
- Cycle 10 has no chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 17, 2, 26, 19, 6, 28, 0> with one chord <6, 28>
- <1, 13, 27, 8, 26, 19, 12, 10> with one chord <6, 28>
