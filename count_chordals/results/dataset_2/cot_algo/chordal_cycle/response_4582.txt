Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 7) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 13) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 3) (18, 4) (18, 16) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 8) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 16) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 2) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 15) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-12-3 (with chord 9-12)
- Cycle 2: 4-7-17-14 (with chord 7-17)
- Cycle 3: 1-6-8-5 (with chord 6-8)
- Cycle 4: 1-16-18-4 (with chord 16-18)
- Cycle 5: 10-11-13-15 (with chord 11-13)

Step 2:
All cycles listed above have exactly one chord, making them chordal 4-cycles. 

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:

<1-6-8-5, (6, 8)>
<4-7-17-14, (7, 17)>
<5-9-12-3, (9, 12)>
<10-11-13-15, (11, 13)>
<1-16-18-4, (16, 18)>
