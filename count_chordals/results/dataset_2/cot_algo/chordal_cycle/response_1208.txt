- Cycle 3: (1, 7, 0, 10, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 13, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 5: (2, 0, 7, 5, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 8, 12, 6, 2)
- Cycle 7: (3, 1, 7, 5, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 5, 0, 8, 3)
- Cycle 9: (5, 0, 10, 11, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 7, 1, 13, 5)
- Cycle 11: (6, 7, 9, 12, 6)
- Cycle 12: (8, 0, 10, 2, 8)
- Cycle 13: (8, 2, 12, 14, 8)
- Cycle 14: (9, 4, 1, 13, 9)
- Cycle 15: (10, 0, 2, 12, 10)
- Cycle 16: (10, 1, 3, 5, 10)
- Cycle 17: (11, 5, 7, 0, 11)
- Cycle 18: (12, 6, 7, 5, 12)
- Cycle 19: (12, 8, 2, 10, 12)
- Cycle 20: (13, 1, 4, 9, 13)
- Cycle 21: (14, 1, 7, 0, 14)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (4, 9), 10, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (7, 0), 10, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (1, 13), 9, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (0, 7), 5, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, (6, 12), 8, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <3, (1, 7), 5, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, (0, 8), 5, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, (0, 10), 11, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <5, (1, 13), 7, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <6, (7, 9), 12, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <8, (2, 10), 12, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <8, (12, 14), 2, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <9, (1, 13), 4, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <10, (0, 2), 12, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <10, (1, 3), 5, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <11, (5, 7), 0, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <12, (6, 7), 5, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <12, (2, 10), 8, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <13, (4, 9), 1, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <14, (7, 0), 1, 14>

As there are 20 chordal 4-cycles identified, the final number to be put inside brackets is [20].
