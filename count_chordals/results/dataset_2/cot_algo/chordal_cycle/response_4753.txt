Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 10) (13, 1) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 4) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 0) (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 20) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 28) (26, 15) (26, 18) (26, 29) (26, 27) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 29) (28, 3) (28, 19) (28, 11) (28, 18) (28, 10) (18, 26) (18, 28) (18, 24) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 25) (12, 23) (24, 18) (24, 17) (24, 14) (17, 3) (17, 24) (17, 5) (29, 26) (29, 11) (25, 9) (25, 4) (1, 13) (1, 11) (20, 21) (20, 5) (20, 16) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 28) (5, 17) (5, 20) (16, 20) (16, 14) (14, 9) (14, 24) (14, 16) (14, 27) (27, 26) (27, 14) (27, 23) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 12) (23, 27) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 2-3-15-26-2
- Cycle 2: 13-21-7-23-13
- Cycle 3: 13-21-20-5-17-24-18-26-15-3-13
- Cycle 4: 15-3-17-24-14-9-6-15
- Cycle 5: 9-6-15-26-18-24-17-3-9
- Cycle 6: 9-6-10-8-2-15-26-18-28-3-9
- Cycle 7: 28-3-15-26-27-14-16-20-21-7-28

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (5, 24) making it a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (3, 24) making it a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (3, 6) making it a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (6, 10) making it a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<3, (5, 24), 24>
<4, (3, 24), 9>
<5, (3, 6), 24>
<6, (6, 10), 28>
