Step 2:

- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (9, 14), 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (9, 10), 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (9, 14), 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (14, 13), 10)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (7, 3), 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (7, 3), 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (7, 11), 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (2, 13), 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, (6, 7), 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, (6, 7), 11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, (6, 8), 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, (14, 13), 10)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, (14, 13), 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, (10, 3), 4)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
The total number of chordal 4-cycles is [58].
