Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (17, 0) (17, 5) (5, 17) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 18) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 0) (15, 18) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (12, 3) (16, 4) (16, 10) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 14) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
- (4, 16, 10, 11, 4)
- (4, 19, 1, 5, 4)
- (7, 11, 10, 3, 7)
- (7, 18, 15, 0, 7)
- (10, 16, 4, 19, 10)
- (10, 11, 9, 2, 10)
- (11, 7, 18, 8, 11)
- (17, 0, 15, 18, 17)
- (17, 5, 1, 13, 17)
- (5, 1, 13, 14, 5)
- (5, 0, 2, 6, 5)
- (6, 2, 9, 11, 6)
- (8, 2, 3, 12, 8)
- (8, 18, 0, 5, 8)
- (1, 5, 0, 2, 1)
- (1, 13, 14, 8, 1)
- (15, 0, 2, 9, 15)
- (9, 11, 10, 16, 9)
- (12, 3, 7, 18, 12)
- (16, 4, 19, 13, 16)
- (19, 4, 16, 10, 19)
- (3, 7, 11, 9, 3)
- (14, 8, 18, 15, 14)
- (0, 17, 5, 1, 0)
- (13, 1, 5, 17, 13)
- (18, 7, 3, 2, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <4, (16, 10), 11>
- <4, (19, 1), 5>
- <7, (11, 10), 3>
- <7, (18, 15), 0>
- <10, (16, 4), 19>
- <10, (11, 9), 2>
- <11, (7, 18), 8>
- <17, (0, 15), 18>
- <17, (5, 1), 13>
- <5, (1, 13), 14>
- <5, (0, 2), 6>
- <6, (2, 9), 11>
- <8, (2, 3), 12>
- <8, (18, 0), 5>
- <1, (5, 0), 2>
- <1, (13, 14), 8>
- <15, (0, 2), 9>
- <9, (11, 10), 16>
- <12, (3, 7), 18>
- <16, (4, 19), 13>
- <19, (4, 16), 10>
- <3, (7, 11), 9>
- <14, (8, 18), 15>
- <0, (17, 5), 1>
- <13, (1, 5), 17>
- <18, (7, 3), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 27 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [27].
