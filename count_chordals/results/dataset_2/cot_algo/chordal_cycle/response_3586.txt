Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4: 
1. (4, 3, 2, 8, 4)
2. (4, 0, 7, 1, 8, 4)
3. (4, 8, 9, 2, 4)
4. (8, 5, 8, 1, 6, 7, 2, 9, 0, 7, 1, 8)

Step 2:
Checking for chords:
1. Cycle 1: (4, 3, 2, 8, 4) - No chords
2. Cycle 2: (4, 0, 7, 1, 8, 4) - Chord: (0, 1)
3. Cycle 3: (4, 8, 9, 2, 4) - Chord: (9, 2)
4. Cycle 4: (8, 5, 8, 1, 6, 7, 2, 9, 0, 7, 1, 8) - No chords

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<4, 0, 7, 1, 8, 4>
<4, 8, 9, 2, 4>
