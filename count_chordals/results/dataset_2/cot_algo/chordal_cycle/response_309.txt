Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 2) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <4, 7, 1, 4>
- Cycle 2: <4, 7, 6, 4>
- Cycle 3: <4, 1, 3, 4>
- Cycle 4: <7, 1, 3, 7>
- Cycle 5: <7, 1, 12, 7>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 2, 1>
- Cycle 7: <8, 5, 12, 8>
- Cycle 8: <10, 4, 11, 10>
- Cycle 9: <11, 7, 6, 11>
- Cycle 10: <5, 8, 14, 5>
- Cycle 11: <6, 7, 13, 6>
- Cycle 12: <12, 1, 3, 12>
- Cycle 13: <2, 3, 13, 2>
- Cycle 14: <0, 1, 3, 0>
- Cycle 15: <14, 8, 5, 14>
- Cycle 16: <9, 1, 12, 9>
- Cycle 17: <11, 10, 0, 11>
- Cycle 18: <8, 5, 4, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <4, 7, 1, 4> has chord (7, 1)
- <4, 7, 6, 4> has chord (7, 6)
- <4, 1, 3, 4> has chord (1, 3)
- <7, 1, 3, 7> has chord (1, 3)
- <7, 1, 12, 7> has chord (1, 12)
- <1, 3, 2, 1> has chord (3, 2)
- <8, 5, 12, 8> has chord (5, 12)
- <10, 4, 11, 10> has chord (4, 11)
- <11, 7, 6, 11> has chord (7, 6)
- <5, 8, 14, 5> has chord (8, 14)
- <6, 7, 13, 6> has chord (7, 13)
- <12, 1, 3, 12> has chord (1, 3)
- <2, 3, 13, 2> has chord (3, 13)
- <0, 1, 3, 0> has chord (1, 3)
- <14, 8, 5, 14> has chord (8, 5)
- <9, 1, 12, 9> has chord (1, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 16 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [16].
