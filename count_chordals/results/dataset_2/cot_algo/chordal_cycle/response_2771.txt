Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 15) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 18) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 13) (14, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 9) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 17) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 16) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 13) (17, 15) (17, 18) (6, 0) (13, 14) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 19) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 17) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 16) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (3, 5, 3, 4)
- Cycle 2: (3, 8, 2, 7)
- Cycle 3: (3, 0, 1, 8)
- Cycle 4: (3, 4, 12, 8)
- Cycle 5: (3, 4, 12, 18)
- Cycle 6: (3, 0, 18, 17)
- Cycle 7: (3, 0, 6, 0)
- Cycle 8: (5, 3, 0, 1)
- Cycle 9: (5, 3, 8, 2)
- Cycle 10: (5, 3, 4, 12)
- Cycle 11: (5, 3, 4, 12)
- Cycle 12: (5, 3, 4, 12)
- Cycle 13: (5, 3, 0, 18)
- Cycle 14: (5, 3, 0, 6)
- Cycle 15: (2, 8, 12, 4)
- Cycle 16: (2, 8, 12, 18)
- Cycle 17: (2, 8, 12, 18)
- Cycle 18: (2, 8, 1, 0)
- Cycle 19: (2, 8, 7, 9)
- Cycle 20: (2, 8, 7, 15)
- ... (total 38 cycles)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, (4, 12), 8, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Final result: [1]
