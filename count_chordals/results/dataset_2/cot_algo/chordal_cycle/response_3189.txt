Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 9, 7)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 3, 4)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 4: (5, 0, 8, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 8, 1, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 7, 4, 8)
- Cycle 7: (9, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 8: (6, 2, 4, 7)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 0, 5)
- Cycle 10: (4, 3, 1, 5)
- Cycle 11: (4, 7, 2, 3)
- Cycle 12: (7, 3, 1, 9)
- Cycle 13: (7, 2, 4, 8)
- Cycle 14: (1, 8, 2, 3)
- Cycle 15: (3, 4, 8, 2)
- Cycle 16: (3, 1, 9, 7)
- Cycle 17: (8, 1, 5, 0)
- Cycle 18: (8, 2, 7, 4)
- Cycle 19: (0, 5, 1, 3)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (0, 8)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (2, 7)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (4, 5)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (3, 4)
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 13 has 1 chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 14 has 1 chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 15 has 1 chord: (3, 8)
- Cycle 16 has 1 chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 17 has 1 chord: (0, 1)
- Cycle 18 has 1 chord: (2, 4)
- Cycle 19 has 1 chord: (1, 3)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 0 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
