- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (9, 6), 5, (1, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (9, 1), 5, (6, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (9, 6), 8, (1, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <7, (9, 6), 5, (1, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <7, (9, 1), 5, (6, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, (9, 5), 7, (1, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, (5, 1), 9, (6, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <6, (8, 1), 9, (5, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <9, (1, 5), 7, (6, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <9, (1, 3), 7, (5, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <1, (5, 3), 9, (6, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <1, (5, 9), 7, (3, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <3, (7, 9), 1, (5, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <3, (2, 5), 1, (7, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <5, (6, 8), 1, (7, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <5, (1, 9), 6, (5, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <5, (1, 8), 6, (5, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <2, (3, 7), 5, (1, 2)>
