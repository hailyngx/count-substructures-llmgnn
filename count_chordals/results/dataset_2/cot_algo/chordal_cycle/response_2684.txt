Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 15) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 15) (8, 0) (8, 15) (9, 14) (9, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (1, 18) (1, 6) (17, 3) (17, 12) (3, 19) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 14) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (13, 0) (13, 16) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (12, 5, 16, 13, 0, 7, 18, 15, 14, 9, 19, 3, 17, 12)
        - Cycle 2: (12, 5, 16, 13, 0, 8, 15, 14, 9, 19, 3, 17, 12)
        - Cycle 3: (12, 10, 14, 15, 2, 6, 1, 18, 7, 5, 12)
        - Cycle 4: (0, 7, 18, 15, 14, 10, 12, 5, 16, 13, 0)
        - Cycle 5: (11, 5, 12, 17, 3, 19, 9, 14, 15, 8, 0, 13, 16, 11)
        - Cycle 6: (12, 3, 4, 11, 5, 16, 13, 0, 7, 18, 1, 6, 2, 15, 14, 9, 19, 3)
        - Cycle 7: (12, 3, 4, 11, 12)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1: <1, (3, 17), 7>
        - Cycle 2: <0, (5, 9), 13>
        - Cycle 3: No chord present
        - Cycle 4: No chord present
        - Cycle 5: No chord present
        - Cycle 6: <6, (2, 14), 15>
        - Cycle 7: No chords, already chordal
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 3 chordless cycles, so the final answer is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (3, 17), 7>
<0, (5, 9), 13>
<6, (2, 14), 15>
