Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 3, 2, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 6, 4, 9)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 2, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 3, 0, 1)
- Cycle 7: (3, 2, 4, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 5, 4)
- Cycle 9: (0, 7, 9, 0)
- Cycle 10: (2, 7, 0, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (5, 6), 4>
- <1, (5, 3), 4>
- <1, (5, 4), 2>
- <3, (9, 6), 5>
- <3, (9, 7), 0>
- <3, (9, 5), 2>
- <4, (6, 9), 4>
- <4, (6, 2), 1>
- <4, (6, 5), 3>
- <0, (7, 9), 1>
- <2, (1, 4), 5>
- <2, (1, 0), 4>
- <2, (1, 7), 3>
- <5, (8, 4), 2>
- <5, (8, 5), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [15]
