Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 29) (26, 6) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 25) (15, 14) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 29) (17, 5) (7, 25) (12, 9) (12, 28) (12, 21) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 6) (22, 20) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 28) (20, 22) (20, 11) (25, 15) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 2) (6, 26) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 21) (6, 24) (21, 12) (21, 6) (21, 27) (21, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (23, 10) (23, 29) (8, 0) (8, 19) (27, 25) (27, 21) (16, 1) (16, 18) (5, 26) (5, 17) (5, 4) (24, 6) (24, 18) (11, 1) (11, 20) (11, 19) (11, 4) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 13) (2, 0) (2, 25) (2, 19) (2, 13) (13, 28) (13, 2) (13, 4) (29, 26) (29, 10) (29, 23) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 24) (4, 21) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. 
Here are some of them:  
1. <0, 14, 3, 6, 0>
2. <1, 28, 13, 2, 1>
3. <2, 25, 15, 3, 14, 0, 2>
4. <4, 5, 26, 6, 14, 0, 8, 19, 2, 13, 4>
5. <5, 26, 29, 23, 10, 18, 24, 6, 21, 12, 9, 28, 1, 20, 11, 4>
6. <9, 28, 1, 20, 11, 19, 8, 0, 14, 6, 26, 5>
7. <10, 18, 16, 1, 28, 0, 2, 25, 7, 25, 15, 3, 6, 21, 27, 25, 2, 13, 4, 11, 20, 22, 11, 1, 16>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes):
- <0, 14, 3, 6, 0> has a chord (3, 0)  
- <1, 28, 13, 2, 1> has a chord (2, 13)  
- <2, 25, 15, 3, 14, 0, 2> has a chord (3, 2)  
- <4, 5, 26, 6, 14, 0, 8, 19, 2, 13, 4> does not have exactly one chord  
- <5, 26, 29, 23, 10, 18, 24, 6, 21, 12, 9, 28, 1, 20, 11, 4> has a chord (10, 24)  
- <9, 28, 1, 20, 11, 19, 8, 0, 14, 6, 26, 5> has a chord (1, 19)  
- <10, 18, 16, 1, 28, 0, 2, 25, 7, 25, 15, 3, 6, 21, 27, 25, 2, 13, 4, 11, 20, 22, 11, 1, 16> has a chord (3, 7)  

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 14, 3, 6, 0>
<1, 28, 13, 2, 1>
<2, 25, 15, 3, 14, 0, 2>
<10, 18, 16, 1, 28, 0, 2, 25, 7, 25, 15, 3, 6, 21, 27, 25, 2, 13, 4, 11, 20, 22, 11, 1, 16>
