Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 4) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 13) (2, 10) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 18) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 8) (11, 0) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (19, 9) (19, 17) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 6) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- Cycle 1: <3, 15, 4, 16, 3>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 13, 7, 5>
- Cycle 3: <9, 13, 7, 10, 9>
- Cycle 4: <9, 13, 7, 18, 5>
- Cycle 5: <4, 16, 8, 11, 0, 4>
- Cycle 6: <0, 11, 8, 16, 5, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 11, 8, 18, 5, 0>
- Cycle 8: <17, 9, 13, 7, 10, 2, 17>
- Cycle 9: <12, 3, 15, 4, 16, 8, 11, 0, 12>
- Cycle 10: <18, 5, 16, 4, 15, 3, 6, 12, 1, 18>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:  
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, 15, 4, 16, 3> with chord (4, 16)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 9, 13, 7, 5> with chord (9, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, 13, 7, 10, 9> with chord (13, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, 13, 7, 18, 5> with chord (13, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:  
- There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the count of chordless cycles is [4].
