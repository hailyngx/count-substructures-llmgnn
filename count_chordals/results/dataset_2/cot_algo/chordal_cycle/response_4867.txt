Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 13) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 10) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 10, 1)
- Cycle 2: (3, 5, 11, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 6, 11, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 13, 0, 6, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 13, 9, 12, 3)
- Cycle 6: (4, 8, 11, 12, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 10, 2, 12, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 10, 8, 5, 4)
- Cycle 9: (5, 8, 0, 13, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 11, 6, 0, 5)
- Cycle 11: (8, 11, 3, 13, 8)
- Cycle 12: (8, 11, 6, 0, 8)
- Cycle 13: (0, 6, 11, 3, 0)
- Cycle 14: (0, 8, 5, 13, 0)
- Cycle 15: (2, 10, 4, 12, 2)
- Cycle 16: (9, 12, 4, 10, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (4, 10), 9>
- <3, (5, 11), 6>
- <3, (13, 9), 12>
- <4, (8, 11), 12>
- <4, (10, 2), 12>
- <5, (8, 0), 13>
- <5, (11, 6), 0>
- <8, (11, 3), 13>
- <8, (11, 6), 0>
- <0, (6, 11), 3>
- <0, (8, 5), 13>
- <2, (10, 4), 12>
- <9, (12, 4), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 13 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final number is [13].
