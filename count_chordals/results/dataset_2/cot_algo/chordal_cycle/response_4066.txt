Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 15) (16, 14) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 14) (6, 26) (6, 19) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 0) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 1) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 14) (22, 25) (29, 0) (29, 25) (29, 21) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 11) (8, 28) (8, 26) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 23) (27, 24) (27, 20) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 13) (26, 6) (26, 18) (26, 8) (26, 14) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 17) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 22) (14, 26) (14, 12) (5, 11) (5, 23) (5, 12) (19, 6) (19, 17) (10, 18) (10, 21) (21, 29) (21, 10) (21, 25) (21, 24) (23, 28) (23, 5) (20, 3) (20, 27) (20, 24) (24, 27) (24, 21) (24, 20) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 1) (17, 7) (17, 19) (25, 22) (25, 29) (25, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
        - Cycle 1: (11, 5, 23, 28, 16)
        - Cycle 2: (3, 0, 29, 25, 22)
        - Cycle 3: (15, 16, 28, 23, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (6, 26, 18, 22, 14)
        - Cycle 5: (9, 3, 4, 13, 18)
        - Cycle 6: (7, 0, 3, 4, 13)
        - Cycle 7: (10, 18, 22, 25, 29)
        - Cycle 8: (21, 29, 25, 22, 18)
        - Cycle 9: (14, 26, 6, 19, 17)
        - Cycle 10: (12, 9, 0, 7, 17)
        - Cycle 11: (1, 15, 16, 14, 22)
        - Cycle 12: (20, 3, 9, 12, 14)
        - Cycle 13: (27, 24, 21, 29, 25)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, (16, 23), 5>
        - <2, (25, 29), 22>
        - <3, (16, 23), 28>
        - <4, (26, 22), 14>
        - <5, (13, 4), 18>
        - <6, (0, 3), 13>
        - <7, (22, 25), 29>
        - <8, (22, 25), 21>
        - <9, (26, 19), 17>
        - <10, (9, 7), 17>
        - <11, (16, 14), 22>
        - <12, (3, 9), 12>
        - <13, (24, 21), 25>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [13]
