Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 11) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 18) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 11) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 7) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 0) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 19) (7, 5) (7, 18) (7, 1) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 0) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 18) (14, 18) (14, 16) (12, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) (16, 9) (16, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
After examining the given graph, we can identify the chordal 4-cycles as follows:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (3, 8, 4, 13, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 11, 15, 8, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 8, 4, 6, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 13, 2, 18, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 11, 0, 2, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 8, 11, 15, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 13, 4, 8, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 11, 0, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 13, 2, 18, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 8, 15, 6, 4)
- Cycle 11: (8, 15, 6, 17, 8)
- Cycle 12: (8, 11, 0, 2, 8)
- Cycle 13: (8, 4, 13, 2, 8)
- Cycle 14: (2, 10, 19, 0, 2)
- Cycle 15: (2, 18, 14, 16, 2)
- Cycle 16: (2, 13, 4, 8, 2)
- Cycle 17: (2, 0, 11, 15, 2)
- Cycle 18: (18, 17, 6, 15, 18)
- Cycle 19: (18, 2, 13, 4, 18)
- Cycle 20: (18, 6, 4, 8, 18)
- Cycle 21: (18, 7, 1, 0, 18)
- Cycle 22: (11, 8, 4, 13, 11)
- Cycle 23: (11, 15, 6, 17, 11)
- Cycle 24: (11, 0, 2, 18, 11)
- Cycle 25: (0, 2, 13, 4, 0)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- The only cycle from the list with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycle) is <6, (17, 15), 18>.

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles = [1].

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
