Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 14) (15, 19) (15, 2) (7, 18) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 8) (16, 17) (16, 7) (16, 12) (12, 16) (9, 14) (9, 19) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (13, 0) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 2) (11, 4) (11, 6) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle 1: <4, 18, 5, 1>
2. Cycle 2: <4, 18, 7, 1>
3. Cycle 3: <4, 18, 3, 14>
4. Cycle 4: <4, 18, 7, 16>
5. Cycle 5: <4, 18, 5, 8>
6. Cycle 6: <7, 18, 3, 14>
7. Cycle 7: <7, 18, 5, 8>
8. Cycle 8: <16, 17, 6, 2>
9. Cycle 9: <10, 1, 5, 8>
10. Cycle 10: <10, 1, 7, 16>
11. Cycle 11: <10, 1, 7, 18>
12. Cycle 12: <10, 19, 15, 2>
13. Cycle 13: <10, 19, 0, 17>
14. Cycle 14: <10, 19, 0, 13>
15. Cycle 15: <10, 14, 9, 19>
16. Cycle 16: <15, 19, 0, 13>
17. Cycle 17: <17, 16, 7, 1>
18. Cycle 18: <17, 16, 12, 6>
19. Cycle 19: <9, 14, 3, 18>
20. Cycle 20: <9, 19, 0, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycle in the graph is:
<4, 18, 7, 1>, with chord (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
