Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 3, 6, 1, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 3, 6, 2, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 3, 6, 7, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 3, 6, 8, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (3, 6, 1, 4, 3)
        - Cycle 6: (3, 6, 1, 7, 3)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 6, 1, 0, 3)
        - Cycle 8: (6, 1, 4, 2, 6)
        - Cycle 9: (6, 1, 4, 7, 6)
        - Cycle 10: (6, 1, 4, 7, 3, 6)
        - Cycle 11: (6, 1, 0, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 12: (6, 1, 7, 3, 6)
        - Cycle 13: (6, 2, 4, 1, 6)
        - Cycle 14: (6, 2, 7, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 15: (6, 2, 7, 3, 6)
        - Cycle 16: (6, 2, 8, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 17: (6, 7, 1, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 18: (6, 7, 1, 0, 6)
        - Cycle 19: (6, 7, 3, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 20: (6, 7, 4, 2, 6)
        - Cycle 21: (6, 7, 4, 2, 0, 6)
        - Cycle 22: (6, 7, 0, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 23: (6, 7, 2, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 24: (6, 7, 2, 0, 6)
        - Cycle 25: (6, 7, 2, 8, 6)
        - Cycle 26: (6, 8, 2, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 27: (1, 4, 7, 0, 1)
        - Cycle 28: (1, 4, 7, 2, 1)
        - Cycle 29: (1, 7, 6, 2, 1)
        - Cycle 30: (1, 7, 3, 5, 1)
        - Cycle 31: (1, 0, 5, 2, 1)
        - Cycle 32: (1, 0, 7, 6, 1)
        - Cycle 33: (1, 0, 7, 4, 1)
        - Cycle 34: (3, 5, 2, 7, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 10: (6, 1, 4, 7, 3, 6) has the chord (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count is [1]. The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <10, (4, 7), 3>.
