Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 24) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 7) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 18) (22, 23) (23, 22) (23, 24) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 19) (0, 13) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 5) (20, 10) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 20) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 16) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 1) (29, 18) (7, 15) (7, 12) (12, 23) (12, 7) (12, 24) (26, 24) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 26) (18, 17) (18, 29) (18, 9) (18, 11) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 25) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 10) (10, 20) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 16) (8, 28) (8, 27) (8, 16) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 27) (4, 14) (28, 8) (28, 13) (28, 25) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 27) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 19) (11, 18) (13, 0) (13, 28) (13, 27) (25, 0) (25, 21) (25, 28) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 19) (27, 9) (27, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle with 4 nodes: (3, 15, 7, 12), (3, 15, 1, 29), (3, 15, 7, 12), (3, 21, 10, 1), (3, 21, 10, 1), (3, 24, 26, 24), (3, 24, 26, 24), (3, 24, 26, 24), (15, 1, 10, 21), (15, 1, 10, 21), (15, 7, 12, 23), (15, 7, 12, 23), (24, 26, 24, 12), (24, 26, 24, 12)
- Cycle with 6 nodes: (3, 15, 1, 10, 21, 3), (15, 7, 12, 23, 24, 26), (15, 1, 10, 9, 18, 17)
- Cycle with 8 nodes: (3, 24, 26, 24, 12, 23, 22, 23)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <3, 15, 7, 12, 23, 24, 26, 24, 3> has exactly one chord (15, 1)
- <15, 7, 12, 23, 24, 26, 24, 12, 15> has exactly one chord (1, 10)
- <15, 1, 10, 9, 18, 17, 14, 5, 3> has exactly one chord (15, 7)
- <3, 24, 26, 24, 12, 23, 22, 23, 3> has exactly one chord (15, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
