Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 14) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the provided graph is <5, 0, 2, 3>, with a single chord (5, 2). 

Therefore, the final count inside brackets is [1].
