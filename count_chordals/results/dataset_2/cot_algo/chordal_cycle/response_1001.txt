Step 2: Checking cycles for one chord:
- <1, (3, 4), 25, 1>
- <1, (9, 24), 26, 1>
- <3, (19, 28), 22, 3>
- <4, 25, (5, 0), 4>
- <8, (13, 18), 14, 8>
- <13, (18, 14), 6, 13>
- <13, (18, 20), 2, 13>
- <14, 27, (22, 6), 14>
- <20, 18, (13, 26), 20>
- <22, 27, (7, 15), 22>
- <25, 5, (28, 11), 25>
- <29, 8, (13, 18), 29>
- <0, (26, 24), 9, 0>
- <0, (26, 13), 8, 0>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
