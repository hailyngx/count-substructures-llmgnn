Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 6 - 1 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 6 - 7 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 7 - 9 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 7 - 4 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 5: 5 - 0 - 3 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 6: 6 - 7 - 4 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 7: 6 - 5 - 0 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 8: 6 - 7 - 0 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 9: 6 - 8 - 9 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 10: 6 - 8 - 7 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 11: 7 - 8 - 9 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 12: 7 - 0 - 3 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 13: 7 - 0 - 4 - 9 - 7
- Cycle 14: 7 - 0 - 5 - 8 - 7

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords <6, 1> and <3, 5>.
- Cycle 2 has 2 chords <6, 7> and <6, 4>.
- Cycle 3 has 2 chords <5, 9> and <9, 4>.
- Cycle 4 has 2 chords <7, 4> and <5, 0>.
- Cycle 5 has 2 chords <3, 4> and <0, 5>.
- Cycle 6 has 2 chords <7, 4> and <5, 6>.
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord <0, 3>.
- Cycle 8 has 2 chords <5, 7> and <6, 8>.
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord <7, 9>.
- Cycle 10 has 2 chords <6, 5> and <7, 8>.
- Cycle 11 has 2 chords <8, 9> and <7, 4>.
- Cycle 12 has 2 chords <3, 0> and <1, 7>.
- Cycle 13 has 2 chords <0, 4> and <7, 9>.
- Cycle 14 has 2 chords <0, 5> and <7, 8>.

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, (6, 1), (6, 4), 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3), (1, 7), 4, 7)>
