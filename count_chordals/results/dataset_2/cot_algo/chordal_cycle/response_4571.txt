Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 12) (18, 22) (18, 16) (18, 17) (18, 25) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 0) (20, 13) (20, 11) (25, 9) (25, 18) (25, 14) (2, 29) (2, 27) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 3) (1, 26) (3, 29) (3, 27) (3, 23) (26, 1) (26, 10) (19, 5) (19, 17) (11, 20) (11, 0) (11, 21) (11, 4) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 15) (16, 18) (16, 28) (16, 10) (7, 5) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 27) (4, 11) (4, 17) (4, 21) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 13) (8, 28) (24, 17) (24, 14) (15, 28) (15, 23) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 15) (27, 22) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 12) (17, 18) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 24) (13, 20) (13, 10) (13, 27) (21, 11) (21, 4) (14, 9) (14, 25) (14, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with their edges:  
- Cycle: <5, 9, 6, 12, 5>  
- Cycle: <18, 22, 27, 2, 18>  
- Cycle: <20, 11, 4, 17, 24, 14, 25, 9, 6, 12, 0, 11, 20>  
- Cycle: <2, 29, 7, 5, 12, 6, 9, 25, 18, 16, 28, 8, 7>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:  
- Cycle: <5, 9, 6, 12, 5> has chord (6, 12)  
- Cycle: <18, 22, 27, 2, 18> has chord (22, 2)  
- Cycle: <20, 11, 4, 17, 24, 14, 25, 9, 6, 12, 0, 11, 20> has chord (9, 25)  
- Cycle: <2, 29, 7, 5, 12, 6, 9, 25, 18, 16, 28, 8, 7> has chord (5, 16)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:  
There are [0] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
