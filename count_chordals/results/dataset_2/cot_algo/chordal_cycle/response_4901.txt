Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 7) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 21) (4, 21) (4, 25) (7, 9) (7, 28) (12, 13) (12, 8) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 1) (2, 18) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 6) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 11) (20, 18) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 28) (14, 0) (14, 3) (8, 12) (8, 22) (8, 3) (22, 26) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 16) (17, 6) (29, 24) (29, 11) (1, 27) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 25) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 21) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 1) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 23) (25, 4) (25, 1) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 22) (10, 27) (10, 0) (10, 23) (11, 0) (11, 29) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 5) (23, 9) (23, 6) (23, 10) (23, 21) (13, 12) (13, 21) (13, 28) (21, 26) (21, 4) (21, 15) (21, 23) (21, 13) (3, 2) (3, 20) (3, 14) (3, 8) (5, 24) (28, 7) (28, 20) (28, 13) 

Response:
Number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<9, (19, 21), 26>
<9, (23, 21), 26>
<9, (7, 28), 13>
<26, (21, 13), 9>
