Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 0, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 4, 1, 8, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 1, 3, 9, 5)
- Cycle 6: (9, 4, 6, 7, 5, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 3, 1, 4, 7, 9)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 2, 9, 3, 1, 4)
- Cycle 9: (7, 6, 4, 1, 7)
- Cycle 10: (1, 8, 0, 2, 9, 3, 1)

Step 2:  
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (0, 8)>
- <2, (4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 8)>
- <4, (1, 4)>
- <5, (1, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4)>
- <8, (8, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7)>
- <10, (1, 8)>

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:  
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Final Result: [0]
