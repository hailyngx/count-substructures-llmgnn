Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 1) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 6-1-11-13-5-6
- Cycle 2: 6-1-4-12-6
- Cycle 3: 6-5-7-4-6
- Cycle 4: 6-5-13-2-6
- Cycle 5: 9-7-4-12-9
- Cycle 6: 4-8-14-2-4
- Cycle 7: 7-0-2-13-7
- Cycle 8: 7-0-14-11-7
- Cycle 9: 7-4-1-11-7
- Cycle 10: 7-4-12-8-7
- Cycle 11: 7-5-13-11-7
- Cycle 12: 9-10-6-1-9
- Cycle 13: 11-14-8-4-11
- Cycle 14: 11-14-12-13-11
- Cycle 15: 12-4-1-6-12
- Cycle 16: 12-4-7-9-12
- Cycle 17: 13-5-7-11-13
- Cycle 18: 13-2-0-14-13
- Cycle 19: 13-2-3-11-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <6, (1, 11), 13, 5>
- <6, (1, 4), 12, 6>
- <6, (5, 7), 4, 6>
- <6, (5, 13), 2, 6>
- <9, (7, 4), 12, 9>
- <4, (8, 14), 2, 4>
- <7, (0, 2), 13, 7>
- <7, (0, 14), 11, 7>
- <7, (4, 1), 11, 7>
- <7, (4, 12), 8, 7>
- <7, (5, 13), 11, 7>
- <9, (10, 6), 1, 9>
- <11, (8, 14), 4, 11>
- <11, (12, 13), 14, 11>
- <12, (6, 1), 4, 12>
- <12, (4, 7), 9, 12>
- <13, (7, 11), 5, 13>
- <13, (0, 14), 2, 13>
- <13, (2, 3), 11, 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 19 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. Therefore, the final count is [19].
