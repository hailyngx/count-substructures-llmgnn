Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 8) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 19) (26, 3) (26, 27) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 28) (27, 26) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 16) (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 12) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 2) (25, 17) (25, 20) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 6) (22, 2) (22, 16) (16, 27) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 12) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 8) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 28) (2, 14) (2, 20) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 7) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 6) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 23) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 4) (23, 9) (23, 12) (23, 5) (23, 29) (7, 18) (7, 13) (29, 23) (1, 2) (1, 4) (21, 27) (21, 19) (3, 26) (3, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
In this graph, there are several cycles of length 4 or more. Let's identify and analyze them step by step to find the chordal 4-cycles:

1. Cycle 1: 8 - 15 - 27 - 26 - 8
   Chords: (26, 15)  
   
2. Cycle 2: 8 - 11 - 18 - 7 - 8
   Chords: (18, 7)

3. Cycle 3: 0 - 20 - 25 - 17 - 0
   Chords: (25, 20)

4. Cycle 4: 0 - 6 - 17 - 14 - 0
   Chords: (17, 14)

5. Cycle 5: 0 - 5 - 10 - 11 - 0
   Chords: (10, 11)

6. Cycle 6: 4 - 1 - 2 - 14 - 4
   Chords: (2, 14)

7. Cycle 7: 4 - 5 - 0 - 6 - 4
   Chords: (0, 6)

8. Cycle 8: 4 - 2 - 22 - 16 - 4
   Chords: (22, 16)

9. Cycle 9: 4 - 1 - 2 - 20 - 4
   Chords: (2, 20)

Total number of chordal 4-cycles = [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <>
- <8, 15, 27, 26> with chord (26, 15)
