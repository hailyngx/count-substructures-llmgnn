Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 19) (2, 3) (2, 12) (13, 16) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 13) (19, 17) (19, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 18) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 15) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 18) (15, 14) (15, 8) (15, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 8) (4, 11) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
- (9, 5, 3, 1, 9)
- (11, 10, 7, 13, 11)
- (17, 10, 7, 13, 17)
- (0, 7, 13, 16, 0)
- (12, 9, 5, 16, 12)
- (16, 13, 7, 0, 16)
- (14, 1, 3, 2, 14)
- (8, 1, 3, 5, 8)
- (15, 14, 1, 8, 15)
- (18, 6, 16, 13, 18)
- (4, 11, 10, 17, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <9, (5, 1), 3>
- <11, (10, 7), 13>
- <17, (10, 7), 13>
- <0, (7, 13), 16>
- <12, (9, 5), 16>
- <16, (13, 7), 0>
- <14, (1, 3), 2>
- <8, (1, 3), 5>
- <15, (14, 1), 8>
- <18, (6, 16), 13>
- <4, (11, 10), 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [11].
