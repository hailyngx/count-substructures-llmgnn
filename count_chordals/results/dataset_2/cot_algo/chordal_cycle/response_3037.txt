Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 8) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 12) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 15) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 9) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 9) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 11) (6, 0) (6, 16) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 16) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 13) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 14) (16, 9) (5, 10) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (3, 15, 8, 10, 3)
- (3, 0, 7, 14, 3)
- (3, 14, 8, 15, 3)
- (15, 8, 10, 17, 15)
- (10, 8, 14, 16, 10)
- (10, 17, 4, 12, 10)
- (17, 4, 12, 18, 17)
- (17, 11, 13, 9, 17)
- (2, 1, 9, 19, 2)
- (2, 18, 12, 4, 2)
- (1, 16, 14, 7, 1)
- (1, 9, 19, 4, 1)
- (0, 3, 15, 8, 0)
- (0, 7, 14, 3, 0)
- (7, 14, 16, 6, 7)
- (8, 19, 9, 1, 8)
- (19, 9, 16, 6, 19)
- (4, 12, 18, 2, 4)
- (4, 9, 1, 2, 4)
- (6, 16, 14, 7, 6)
- (14, 16, 9, 1, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, (8, 15), 10, 3>
- <3, (0, 7), 14, 3>
- <15, (8, 10), 17, 15>
- <10, (8, 14), 16, 10>
- <17, (4, 12), 18, 17>
- <17, (11, 13), 9, 17>
- <2, (1, 9), 19, 2>
- <2, (18, 12), 4, 2>
- <1, (16, 14), 7, 1>
- <1, (9, 19), 4, 1>
- <0, (7, 14), 16, 0>
- <7, (16, 6), 14, 7>
- <8, (19, 9), 1, 8>
- <19, (16, 6), 9, 19>
- <4, (12, 18), 2, 4>
- <4, (9, 1), 2, 4>
- <6, (16, 14), 7, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [16].
