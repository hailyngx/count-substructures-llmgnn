Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 5, 3, 1, 9, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 5, 8, 9, 6, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 9).
- Cycle 2 has a chord (8, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <4, 7, 5, 3, (1, 9), 4>
- <4, 7, 5, 8, (8, 5), 9>
