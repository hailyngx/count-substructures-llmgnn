Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) 

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in this graph are as follows:

Step 1: All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <5, 9, 1, 7>
- <5, 9, 13, 3>
- <5, 9, 4, 7>
- <5, 6, 8, 14>
- <9, 4, 7, 3>
- <9, 1, 7, 3>
- <9, 13, 3, 12>
- <4, 7, 3, 1>
- <7, 5, 6, 11>
- <7, 1, 14, 8>
- <1, 9, 13, 3>
- <1, 7, 3, 4>
- <3, 4, 7, 11>
- <3, 7, 1, 14>
- <8, 6, 5, 2>
- <8, 14, 1, 9>
- <6, 5, 2, 10>
- <6, 11, 7, 4>
- <0, 6, 5, 2>
- <0, 12, 3, 13>
- <10, 8, 14, 1>
- <11, 7, 1, 9>
- <14, 2, 5, 9>
- <2, 10, 8, 6>
- <12, 0, 6, 5>
- <13, 9, 1, 14>

Step 2: The cycles with exactly one chord (i.e., a unique non-adjacent edge) are:
- <5, 9, 1, (7)>
- <5, 9, 13, (3)>
- <5, 9, 4, (7)>
- <5, 6, 8, (14)>
- <9, 4, 7, (3)>
- <9, 1, 7, (3)>
- <9, 13, 3, (12)>
- <4, 7, 3, (1)>
- <7, 5, 6, (11)>
- <7, 1, 14, (8)>
- <1, 9, 13, (3)>
- <1, 7, 3, (4)>
- <3, 4, 7, (11)>
- <3, 7, 1, (14)>
- <8, 6, 5, (2)>
- <8, 14, 1, (9)>
- <6, 5, 2, (10)>
- <6, 11, 7, (4)>
- <0, 6, 5, (2)>
- <0, 12, 3, (13)>
- <10, 8, 14, (1)>
- <11, 7, 1, (9)>
- <14, 2, 5, (9)>
- <2, 10, 8, (6)>
- <12, 0, 6, (5)>
- <13, 9, 1, (14)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have [26].
