Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 15) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 0) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 2) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 1) (1, 8) (1, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 3) (9, 14) (9, 7) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 15) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 14) (18, 12) (18, 15) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 15) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (8, 1, 19, 6, 8)
- Cycle 2: (8, 16, 12, 10, 5, 11, 2, 4, 19, 1, 8)
- Cycle 3: (13, 16, 12, 10, 5, 11, 2, 4, 3, 0, 13)
- Cycle 4: (16, 8, 6, 0, 13, 16)
- Cycle 5: (6, 8, 1, 19, 4, 2, 11, 5, 3, 0, 6)
- Cycle 6: (7, 8, 1, 19, 4, 17, 15, 12, 16, 14, 9, 7)
- Cycle 7: (15, 17, 4, 2, 11, 5, 10, 12, 16, 14, 9, 7, 15)
- Cycle 8: (12, 16, 14, 9, 7, 15, 18, 12)
  
Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 19)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (10, 11)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (5, 4)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (8, 13)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (8, 19)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (8, 15)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (12, 17)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (16, 9)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
