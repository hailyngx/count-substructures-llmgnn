Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

There are several possible cycles in the graph, but we are only interested in those with at least 4 nodes. Let's list them:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-7-0-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-4-2-1
- Cycle 4: 2-4-3-0-2
- Cycle 5: 2-4-6-1-2
- Cycle 6: 2-4-1-8-2
- Cycle 7: 3-6-4-1-3
- Cycle 8: 3-4-2-8-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

From the listed cycles above, only Cycle 5: 2-4-6-1-2 has exactly one chord. The chord is between the non-adjacent nodes 4 and 1.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, (4, 1), 2>.
