Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 19) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 17) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (15, 2) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (16, 1) (16, 14) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (17, 2) (17, 11) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 12) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 18) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

From the given edges, we can identify the following cycles:
- Cycle 1: 2-8-2-15-2
- Cycle 2: 2-15-2-8-2
- Cycle 3: 2-15-6-15-2
- Cycle 4: 2-17-11-5-2
- Cycle 5: 2-5-11-17-2
- Cycle 6: 5-11-17-2-5
- Cycle 7: 5-7-19-6-5
- Cycle 8: 5-2-8-2-5
- Cycle 9: 8-2-5-11-8
- Cycle 10: 9-4-19-7-9
- Cycle 11: 9-0-10-15-9
- Cycle 12: 10-0-13-11-10
- Cycle 13: 10-3-10-15-10
- Cycle 14: 10-15-2-17-10
- Cycle 15: 11-5-2-17-11
- Cycle 16: 11-17-2-15-11
- Cycle 17: 11-13-0-13-11
- Cycle 18: 11-12-14-16-11
- Cycle 19: 13-15-2-17-13
- Cycle 20: 13-0-10-3-13
- Cycle 21: 13-11-17-2-13
- Cycle 22: 15-2-17-11-15
- Cycle 23: 15-10-0-13-15
- Cycle 24: 15-13-11-12-15
- Cycle 25: 16-1-16-14-16
- Cycle 26: 19-4-9-12-19
- Cycle 27: 19-14-7-5-19
- Cycle 28: 19-6-15-2-19
- Cycle 29: 19-7-14-12-19
- Cycle 30: 5-11-13-0-5
- Cycle 31: 7-19-6-15-7
- Cycle 32: 7-14-12-9-7
- Cycle 33: 12-18-13-0-12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Among the identified cycles, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (4, 19), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles identified.

Final result: [1]
