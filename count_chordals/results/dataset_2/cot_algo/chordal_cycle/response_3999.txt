Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <4, 7, 3, 4>
- Cycle 2: <4, 2, 24, 2, 4>
- Cycle 3: <4, 15, 25, 12, 4>
- Cycle 4: <7, 4, 12, 26, 11, 7>
- Cycle 5: <7, 5, 23, 19, 28, 26, 12, 4, 7>
- Cycle 6: <7, 5, 13, 29, 6, 22, 7>
- Cycle 7: <10, 3, 4, 15, 25, 12, 26, 11, 10>
- Cycle 8: <11, 21, 27, 20, 13, 5, 7, 3, 14, 11>
- Cycle 9: <16, 8, 23, 5, 13, 29, 6, 22, 16>
- Cycle 10: <16, 1, 25, 15, 4, 12, 26, 18, 1>
- Cycle 11: <16, 21, 27, 20, 9, 28, 26, 18, 16>
- Cycle 12: <17, 0, 20, 13, 29, 6, 22, 17>
- Cycle 13: <18, 1, 25, 12, 26, 28, 24, 2, 16, 18>
- Cycle 14: <18, 19, 23, 5, 7, 3, 21, 27, 20, 18>
- Cycle 15: <19, 23, 8, 16, 21, 3, 7, 5, 13, 19>
- Cycle 16: <19, 17, 0, 20, 27, 21, 3, 14, 18, 19>
- Cycle 17: <25, 15, 4, 3, 21, 27, 20, 13, 29, 25>
- Cycle 18: <28, 1, 25, 15, 4, 3, 10, 3, 21, 27, 28>
- Cycle 19: <28, 9, 27, 21, 3, 7, 5, 13, 20, 28>
- Cycle 20: <9, 20, 13, 5, 7, 3, 21, 27, 9>
- Cycle 21: <9, 24, 2, 16, 21, 3, 4, 15, 25, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (2, 24)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (15, 25)
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (13, 29)
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord: (27, 20)
- Cycle 11 has exactly one chord: (9, 28)
- Cycle 19 has exactly one chord: (3, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<4, 2, 24, 2>
<4, 15, 25, 12>
<7, 5, 13, 29>
<11, 21, 27, 20>
<16, 1, 25, 15>
<9, 24, 2, 16>
