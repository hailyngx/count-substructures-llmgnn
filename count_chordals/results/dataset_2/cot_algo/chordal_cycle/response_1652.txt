Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 15) (8, 7) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 15) (15, 10) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 7) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 5) (1, 16) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 12) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 5) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1:
- The cycles of length 4 in this graph are:
    - Cycle 1: (0, 4, 13, 11, 15, 10, 0)
    - Cycle 2: (0, 14, 9, 19, 12, 16, 13, 4, 0)
    - Cycle 3: (2, 11, 15, 10, 0, 4, 13, 16, 2)
    - Cycle 4: (3, 11, 15, 10, 14, 0, 4, 13, 3)
    - Cycle 5: (5, 16, 12, 19, 3, 11, 13, 7, 5)

Step 2:
- Checking for chords in each cycle:
    - Cycle 1 has no chord.
    - Cycle 2 has a chord: (12, 16)
    - Cycle 3 has no chord.
    - Cycle 4 has a chord: (9, 12)
    - Cycle 5 has no chord.

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 14, 9, 19, 12, 16, 13, 4>
- <0, 4, 13, 11, 15, 10, 0>
