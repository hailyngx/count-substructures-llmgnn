Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 5) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (4, 7, 2, 1, 4)
2. (4, 7, 12, 6, 4)
3. (4, 7, 5, 14, 4)
4. (4, 8, 14, 6, 4)
5. (4, 0, 12, 6, 4)
6. (7, 12, 3, 11, 7)
7. (7, 5, 0, 12, 7)
8. (7, 2, 1, 11, 7)
9. (8, 14, 11, 1, 8)
10. (12, 6, 1, 11, 12)
11. (12, 3, 0, 5, 12)
12. (3, 11, 14, 6, 3)
13. (11, 1, 2, 13, 11)
14. (11, 9, 2, 13, 11)
15. (1, 6, 12, 0, 1)
16. (1, 2, 7, 5, 1)
17. (1, 9, 11, 14, 1)
18. (6, 14, 11, 1, 6)
19. (14, 5, 0, 12, 14)
20. (0, 3, 12, 6, 0)
21. (2, 1, 11, 9, 2)
22. (2, 13, 10, 5, 2)
23. (9, 11, 3, 0, 9)
24. (10, 13, 2, 7, 10)
25. (5, 0, 3, 11, 5)
26. (13, 6, 12, 0, 13)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <4, (7, 2), 1, 8>
- <4, (7, 12), 6, 14>
- <4, (7, 5), 14, 8>
- <4, (8, 14), 6, 7>
- <4, (0, 12), 6, 5>
- <7, (12, 3), 11, 1>
- <7, (5, 0), 12, 2>
- <7, (2, 1), 11, 5>
- <8, (14, 11), 1, 4>
- <12, (6, 1), 11, 3>
- <12, (3, 0), 5, 6>
- <3, (11, 14), 6, 12>
- <11, (1, 2), 13, 9>
- <11, (9, 2), 13, 1>
- <1, (6, 12), 0, 2>
- <1, (2, 7), 5, 11>
- <1, (9, 11), 14, 2>
- <6, (14, 11), 1, 12>
- <14, (5, 0), 12, 13>
- <0, (3, 12), 6, 5>
- <2, (1, 11), 9, 13>
- <2, (13, 10), 5, 7>
- <9, (11, 3), 0, 2>
- <10, (13, 2), 7, 5>
- <5, (0, 3), 11, 12>
- <13, (6, 12), 0, 10>

Step 3:
There are 26 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [26].
