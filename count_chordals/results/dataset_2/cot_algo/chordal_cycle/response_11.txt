Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (22, 28) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 29) (15, 20) (15, 6) (0, 27) (0, 7) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 16) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 18) (21, 2) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 29) (1, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (17, 25) (17, 23) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 28) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 20) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 11) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 18) (19, 26) (19, 11) (18, 21) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 10) (29, 3) (29, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 28) (9, 27) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 23) (24, 25) (2, 21) (2, 11) (16, 27) (16, 9) (16, 6) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 24) (25, 23) (11, 20) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 2) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 28) (10, 18) (10, 12) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 17) (23, 9) (23, 25) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 5) (28, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 3-1-5-13-3
- Cycle 2: 3-1-29-5-3
- Cycle 3: 3-7-23-17-3
- Cycle 4: 0-27-25-24-0
- Cycle 5: 0-7-23-25-0
- Cycle 6: 7-21-2-11-7
- Cycle 7: 7-23-25-24-7
- Cycle 8: 21-18-10-12-21
- Cycle 9: 1-29-3-23-1
- Cycle 10: 1-5-28-12-1
- Cycle 11: 5-13-3-23-5
- Cycle 12: 5-28-22-14-5
- Cycle 13: 9-27-16-6-9
- Cycle 14: 9-23-17-25-9
- Cycle 15: 9-11-20-8-9
- Cycle 16: 9-16-6-14-9
- Cycle 17: 16-6-15-20-16
- Cycle 18: 16-9-27-25-16
- Cycle 19: 18-21-2-11-18
- Cycle 20: 18-4-8-14-18
- Cycle 21: 18-26-19-11-18
- Cycle 22: 18-10-12-28-18
- Cycle 23: 20-15-6-16-20
- Cycle 24: 20-11-2-21-20
- Cycle 25: 26-1-29-3-26
- Cycle 26: 26-18-10-12-26
- Cycle 27: 26-19-11-2-26
- Cycle 28: 28-5-12-10-28

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 5, 29, (3, 23)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <9, 27, 16, (6, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <18, 4, 8, (14, 18)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <26, 1, 29, (3, 23)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
