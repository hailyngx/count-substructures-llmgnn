Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 8) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 15) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 16) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 15) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (17, 4) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 10) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 9) (12, 5) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (11, 16, 0, 2)
- (11, 16, 8, 1)
- (16, 0, 2, 18)
- (16, 8, 15, 11)
- (1, 8, 13, 2)
- (3, 7, 10, 4)
- (3, 18, 2, 13)
- (8, 1, 9, 15)
- (8, 13, 2, 18)
- (13, 2, 18, 3)
- (2, 18, 19, 3)
- (18, 3, 7, 10)
- (18, 15, 14, 6)
- (5, 6, 14, 11)
- (5, 19, 18, 3)
- (6, 14, 15, 11)
- (0, 2, 13, 8)
- (14, 15, 9, 1)
- (19, 18, 15, 8)
- (7, 3, 18, 2)
- (10, 7, 3, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <11, 16, 0, 2>, chord: (16, 8)
- <16, 0, 2, 18>, chord: (0, 2)
- <1, 8, 13, 2>, chord: (8, 1)
- <3, 7, 10, 4>, chord: (3, 7)
- <8, 1, 9, 15>, chord: (1, 8)
- <13, 2, 18, 3>, chord: (2, 18)
- <18, 15, 14, 6>, chord: (15, 18)
- <5, 6, 14, 11>, chord: (6, 5)
- <6, 14, 15, 11>, chord: (14, 6)
- <0, 2, 13, 8>, chord: (2, 13)
- <14, 15, 9, 1>, chord: (15, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Final answer: [10]
