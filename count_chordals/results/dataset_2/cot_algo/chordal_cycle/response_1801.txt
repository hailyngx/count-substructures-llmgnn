Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 3-1-5-4-3
- Cycle 2: 3-5-6-9-3
- Cycle 3: 3-0-4-7-3
- Cycle 4: 3-8-1-5-3
- Cycle 5: 3-0-2-3

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1,5) <1, (1, 5), 4>
- Cycle 2 has a chord (5,9) <2, (5, 9), 6>
- Cycle 3 has a chord (4,7) <3, (4, 7), 8>
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1,8) <4, (1, 8), 5>

Step 3: 
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]
