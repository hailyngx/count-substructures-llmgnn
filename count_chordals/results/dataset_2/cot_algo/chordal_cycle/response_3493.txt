Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 10) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 7, 6, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 9, 10, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 0, 8, 11, 12, 13, 2, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 0, 8, 11, 12, 5, 10, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 0, 8, 4, 10, 5, 2, 13, 12, 11, 0, 1)
- Cycle 7: (3, 9, 10, 5, 12, 13, 8, 0, 1, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 6, 7, 0, 1, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 6, 14, 2, 1, 0, 7, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 7, 14, 5, 2, 1, 6, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 1, 0, 7, 14, 6, 3)
- Cycle 12: (8, 0, 1, 2, 13, 12, 11, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The cycle <1, 3, 9, 10, 5, 2, 1> has exactly one chord - (3, 1).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 3, 9, 10, 5, 2, 1>
