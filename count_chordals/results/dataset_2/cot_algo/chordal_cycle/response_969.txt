Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle <0, 6, 7, 8, 0>
2. Cycle <0, 6, 4, 1, 0>
3. Cycle <0, 6, 5, 8, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

1. Cycle <0, 6, 7, 8, 0> has chord (7, 8)
2. Cycle <0, 6, 4, 1, 0> has chord (4, 1)
3. Cycle <0, 6, 5, 8, 0> has chord (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are [3] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
