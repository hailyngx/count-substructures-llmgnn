Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 10) (8, 5) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 3, 5, 4, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 12, 4, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 4, 5, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 6, 13, 9, 14, 10, 1, 7, 0)
- Cycle 5: (2, 3, 7, 1, 12, 5, 8, 10, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 3, 7, 1, 12, 11, 9, 14, 10, 8, 5, 0, 6, 13, 2)

Step 2: 
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (5, 12), 4, 0>
- Chordal cycle 2: <2, (1, 12), 11, 9>
- Chordal cycle 3: <4, (6, 13), 9, 14>

Step 3: 
The number of chordless cycles found is 3. 

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [3].
