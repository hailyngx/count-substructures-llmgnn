Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1-3-5-1
2. Cycle 1-7-5-1
3. Cycle 1-8-3-1
4. Cycle 1-8-6-10
5. Cycle 1-14-10-6
6. Cycle 3-8-11-12
7. Cycle 3-4-0-3
8. Cycle 3-5-2-10
9. Cycle 4-12-11-8
10. Cycle 4-9-7-13
11. Cycle 10-6-7-13
12. Cycle 10-14-6-2
13. Cycle 11-8-1-3
14. Cycle 12-4-0-12
15. Cycle 2-10-6-7
16. Cycle 2-9-4-0
17. Cycle 5-2-9-7
18. Cycle 5-14-6-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

1. Cycle 1-3-5-1 has chord (3, 5)
2. Cycle 1-7-5-1 has chord (7, 5)
3. Cycle 1-8-3-1 has chord (8, 3)
4. Cycle 1-8-6-10 has chord (1, 10)
5. Cycle 1-14-10-6 has chord (1, 6)
6. Cycle 3-8-11-12 has chord (8, 11)
7. Cycle 3-4-0-3 has chord (4, 3)
8. Cycle 3-5-2-10 has chord (3, 10)
9. Cycle 4-12-11-8 has chord (12, 8)
10. Cycle 4-9-7-13 has chord (9, 7)
11. Cycle 10-6-7-13 has chord (6, 13)
12. Cycle 10-14-6-2 has chord (10, 2)
13. Cycle 11-8-1-3 has chord (8, 1)
14. Cycle 12-4-0-12 has chord (4, 12)
15. Cycle 2-10-6-7 has chord (2, 7)
16. Cycle 2-9-4-0 has chord (9, 0)
17. Cycle 5-2-9-7 has chord (2, 9)
18. Cycle 5-14-6-10 has chord (5, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [18].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (3, 5), 1)>
<1, (7, 5), 1)>
<1, (8, 3), 1)>
<1, (1, 10), 6)>
<1, (1, 6), 10)>
<3, (8, 11), 12)>
<3, (4, 3), 0)>
<3, (3, 10), 2)>
<4, (12, 8), 11)>
<4, (9, 7), 13)>
<10, (6, 13), 7)>
<10, (10, 2), 6)>
<11, (8, 1), 3)>
<12, (4, 12), 0)>
<2, (2, 7), 10)>
<2, (9, 0), 4)>
<5, (2, 9), 7)>
<5, (5, 10), 14)>
