Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        <1, 9, 5, 8> - Cycle of length 4
        <1, 9, 4, 6> - Cycle of length 4
        <1, 9, 4, 0> - Cycle of length 4
        <1, 9, 4, 12> - Cycle of length 4
        <3, 1, 9, 4> - Cycle of length 4
        <3, 1, 9, 2> - Cycle of length 4
        <3, 1, 4, 0> - Cycle of length 4
        <3, 1, 4, 12> - Cycle of length 4
        <13, 3, 1, 9> - Cycle of length 4
        <13, 3, 1, 4> - Cycle of length 4
        <13, 3, 1, 10> - Cycle of length 4
        <11, 6, 4, 9> - Cycle of length 4
        <11, 6, 4, 1> - Cycle of length 4
        <11, 7, 4, 9> - Cycle of length 4
        <0, 7, 11, 4> - Cycle of length 4
        <0, 7, 14, 6> - Cycle of length 4
        <4, 9, 2, 13> - Cycle of length 4
        <10, 1, 4, 12> - Cycle of length 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
        <1, 9, (5, 8), 4> - Chordal 4-cycle
        <1, 9, (4, 6), 0> - Chordal 4-cycle
        <1, 9, (4, 0), 12> - Chordal 4-cycle
        <3, 1, (9, 4), 0> - Chordal 4-cycle
        <3, 1, (4, 0), 12> - Chordal 4-cycle
        <13, 3, (1, 9), 4> - Chordal 4-cycle
        <11, 6, (4, 9), 1> - Chordal 4-cycle
        <11, 7, (4, 9), 6> - Chordal 4-cycle
        <0, 7, (11, 4), 14> - Chordal 4-cycle
        <4, 9, (2, 13), 1> - Chordal 4-cycle
        <10, 1, (4, 12), 0> - Chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
