Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 16) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 11) (26, 4) (1, 21) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 27) (21, 22) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 0) (13, 9) (13, 22) (22, 21) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 20) (23, 26) (23, 29) (23, 28) (23, 27) (10, 3) (10, 27) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 12) (7, 29) (7, 28) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 24) (29, 23) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (3, 21) (3, 10) (3, 16) (19, 11) (11, 26) (11, 22) (11, 29) (11, 19) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 24) (24, 18) (24, 12) (24, 16) (24, 28) (5, 8) (5, 25) (5, 15) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 20) (8, 15) (27, 21) (27, 23) (27, 10) (27, 29) (20, 22) (20, 8) (4, 26) (4, 6) (25, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 15) (28, 23) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 15) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (9, 26, 4, 6, 2, 18, 24, 28, 15, 5, 8, 1, 21, 22, 13, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 13, 22, 21, 1, 8, 5, 15, 6, 4, 26, 23, 27, 10, 3, 16)
- Cycle 3: (9, 13, 22, 20, 8, 1, 21, 27, 10, 3, 16, 24, 18, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 4: (16, 24, 28, 23, 27, 10, 3, 21, 22, 13, 9, 26, 4, 6, 15, 8)
- Cycle 5: (16, 3, 10, 27, 29, 23, 26, 4, 6, 2, 18, 24, 28, 15, 5, 8)
- Cycle 6: (16, 24, 18, 2, 6, 15, 5, 8, 1, 21, 22, 13, 9, 26, 23, 29)
- Cycle 7: (16, 24, 28, 23, 29, 27, 10, 3, 21, 1, 8, 5, 15, 6, 4, 26)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The following chordal 4-cycles are found:
    - Cycle 1: <1, (21, 27), 10, 3>
    - Cycle 2: <9, (13, 22), 1, (8, 5)>
    - Cycle 3: <9, (13, 22), 1, (8, 20)>
    - Cycle 4: <16, (24, 28), 23, (27, 10)>
    - Cycle 5: <16, (24, 18), 2, (6, 15)>
    - Cycle 6: <16, (24, 18), 2, (6, 15)>
    - Cycle 7: <16, (24, 28), 23, (29, 27)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
    - There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [7].
