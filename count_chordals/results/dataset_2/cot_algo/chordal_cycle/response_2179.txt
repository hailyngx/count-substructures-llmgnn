Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 19) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 16) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 8) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 15) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 11) (8, 14) (8, 6) (16, 14) (16, 18) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 17) (9, 7) (9, 10) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 1) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 17) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 7) (1, 18) (1, 10) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

(7, 1, 18, 6)  
(7, 1, 10, 9)  
(7, 1, 18, 16)  
(2, 0, 14, 11)  
(2, 0, 17, 13)  
(2, 0, 14, 16)  
(5, 4, 6, 8)  
(5, 4, 3, 0)  
(5, 4, 6, 18)  
(3, 0, 14, 8)  
(3, 0, 17, 13)  
(3, 0, 14, 16)  
(1, 18, 16, 14)  
(1, 18, 6, 4)  
(1, 18, 16, 8)  
(10, 1, 18, 6)  
(10, 1, 7, 9)  
(10, 1, 18, 16)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

<7, 1, 18, 6> (7, 18)  
<7, 1, 10, 9> (1, 9)  
<7, 1, 18, 16> (1, 16)  
<2, 0, 14, 11> (0, 11)  
<2, 0, 17, 13> (0, 13)  
<2, 0, 14, 16> (0, 16)  
<5, 4, 6, 8> (4, 8)  
<5, 4, 3, 0> (4, 0)  
<5, 4, 6, 18> (4, 18)  
<3, 0, 14, 8> (0, 8)  
<3, 0, 17, 13> (0, 13)  
<3, 0, 14, 16> (0, 16)  
<1, 18, 16, 14> (18, 14)  
<1, 18, 6, 4> (18, 4)  
<1, 18, 16, 8> (18, 8)  
<10, 1, 18, 6> (1, 6)  
<10, 1, 7, 9> (1, 9)  
<10, 1, 18, 16> (1, 16)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 17 chordal 4-cycles found, so the answer is [17].
