Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (15, 18) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 19) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 18) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 19) (16, 0) (16, 5) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 2) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 8) (19, 12) (19, 0) (19, 2) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 8) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 13) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 13) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (9, 17, 10, 1, 9) with edges (9, 17), (17, 10), (10, 1), (1, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 17, 6, 7, 14, 1, 9) with edges (9, 17), (17, 6), (6, 7), (7, 14), (14, 1), (1, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 17, 6, 8, 12, 4, 9) with edges (9, 17), (17, 6), (6, 8), (8, 12), (12, 4), (4, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 17, 6, 8, 18, 9) with edges (9, 17), (17, 6), (6, 8), (8, 18), (18, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 17, 6, 8, 18, 11, 13, 2, 9) with edges (9, 17), (17, 6), (6, 8), (8, 18), (18, 11), (11, 13), (13, 2), (2, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (17, 1)
- Cycle 2 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 3 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 4 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (8, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, which are <1, (17, 1)> and <2, (8, 18)>. 
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
