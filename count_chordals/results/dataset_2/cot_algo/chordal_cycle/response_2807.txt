Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 10) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) 

Response:
Following the steps mentioned earlier,

Step 1:
- Cycle 1: <5, 7, 4, 9>
- Cycle 2: <5, 7, 2, 13>
- Cycle 3: <5, 1, 3, 11>
- Cycle 4: <5, 1, 9, 0>
- Cycle 5: <7, 5, 1, 9>
- Cycle 6: <7, 5, 3, 1>
- Cycle 7: <7, 4, 0, 3>
- Cycle 8: <7, 4, 9, 12>
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 5, 1>
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 12, 9>
- Cycle 11: <4, 9, 1, 13>
- Cycle 12: <4, 9, 12, 7>
- Cycle 13: <1, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle 14: <1, 5, 3, 11>
- Cycle 15: <1, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle 16: <1, 9, 12, 7>
- Cycle 17: <3, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle 18: <3, 5, 1, 9>
- Cycle 19: <3, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 20: <3, 7, 12, 11>

Step 2:
- Chordal Cycles:
  - <5, 7, (4, 9), 9>
  - <5, 1, (3, 11), 9>
  - <7, 5, (1, 9), 4>
  - <7, 4, (0, 3), 9>
  - <3, 5, (7, 4), 1>
  - <3, 7, (4, 0), 11>

Step 3:
- There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
- Therefore, the final answer is [6].
