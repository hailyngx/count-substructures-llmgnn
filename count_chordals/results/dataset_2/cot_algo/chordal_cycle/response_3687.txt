Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 5) (4, 12) (4, 19) (7, 0) (7, 5) (14, 16) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 2) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 18) (1, 17) (1, 6) (0, 7) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 12) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 14, 13, 11)
- Cycle 2: (3, 10, 15, 5, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 12, 4, 19, 3)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 0, 10, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 15, 8, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 9, 2, 17, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 9, 2, 18, 5)
- Cycle 8: (2, 17, 14, 16, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 17, 14, 13, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 17, 1, 6, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 18, 8, 3, 2)
- Cycle 12: (8, 3, 12, 6, 8)
- Cycle 13: (8, 15, 10, 0, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 15, 9, 5, 8)
- Cycle 15: (1, 17, 14, 6, 1)
- Cycle 16: (0, 7, 5, 9, 0)
- Cycle 17: (0, 7, 5, 2, 0)
- Cycle 18: (0, 10, 3, 12, 0)
- Cycle 19: (0, 10, 19, 4, 0)
- Cycle 20: (10, 3, 12, 4, 10)
- Cycle 21: (10, 3, 8, 15, 10)
- Cycle 22: (10, 19, 4, 12, 10)
- Cycle 23: (12, 3, 8, 18, 12)
- Cycle 24: (12, 4, 19, 10, 12)
- Cycle 25: (6, 14, 17, 2, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycles found:
   <1, (13, 16), 17)>
   <2, (3, 12), 4)>
   <3, (5, 9), 15)>
   <4, (5, 9), 2)>
   <5, (2, 17), 14)>
   <6, (2, 17), 1)>
   <7, (8, 15), 10)>
   <8, (12, 3), 6)>
   <9, (0, 7), 5)>
   <10, (0, 7), 2)>
   <11, (0, 10), 3)>
   <12, (0, 10), 19)>
   <13, (7, 0), 10)>
   <14, (7, 5), 9)>
   <15, (7, 5), 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles in this graph is [10].
