Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 1) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 

Based on the given edges, we can list all cycles of length 4 or more where every edge in the cycle exists: 

- Cycle 1: 5-9-2-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-11-13-6-14-5
- Cycle 3: 4-10-8-13-4
- Cycle 4: 8-3-11-6-14-8
- Cycle 5: 12-3-8-13-4-12
- Cycle 6: 2-7-4-13-6-2
- Cycle 7: 9-10-4-7-9
- Cycle 8: 0-1-12-4-13-0
- Cycle 9: 0-11-13-8-3-0

Step 2: 

We check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Checking Cycle 1: 5-9-<2, 4>-5 (Chord: 2-4)
- Checking Cycle 2: 5-11-13-<6, 14>-5 (Chord: 6-14)
- Checking Cycle 3: 4-10-<8, 13>-4 (Chord: 8-13)
- Checking Cycle 4: 8-3-<11, 6>-8 (Chord: 11-6)
- Checking Cycle 5: 12-3-8-<13, 4>-12 (Chord: 13-4)
- Checking Cycle 6: 2-7-<4, 13>-2 (Chord: 4-13)
- Checking Cycle 7: 9-10-4-<7, 2>-9 (Chord: 7-2)
- Checking Cycle 8: 0-1-<12, 4>-0 (Chord: 12-4)
- Checking Cycle 9: 0-11-<13, 8>-0 (Chord: 13-8)

Step 3:

Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have found 9 chordal 4-cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [9]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, (2, 4), 9)>
<5, (6, 14), 11)>
<4, (8, 13), 10)>
<8, (11, 6), 3)>
<12, (13, 4), 3)>
<2, (4, 13), 7)>
<9, (7, 2), 10)>
<0, (12, 4), 1)>
<0, (13, 8), 11)>
