Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: (5, 9), <1, 6, 3, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: (12, 2), <1, 12, 6, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: (10, 0), <1, 10, 6, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: (1, 14), <1, 14, 9, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: (7, 4), <1, 7, 11, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: (8, 5), <4, 7, 9, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: (2, 11), <8, 2, 12, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: (0, 8), <10, 0, 8, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: (13, 14), <9, 13, 14, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [9].
