Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 10) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 2, 9, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 5, 1, 7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 10, 5, 2, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 10, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 2, 9, 7, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 1, 7, 9, 5)
- Cycle 7: (2, 9, 7, 13, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 14, 12, 6, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 14, 6, 13, 2)
- Cycle 10: (12, 6, 13, 7, 12)
- Cycle 11: (12, 14, 6, 0, 12)
- Cycle 12: (12, 14, 2, 5, 12)
- Cycle 13: (12, 1, 5, 10, 12)
- Cycle 14: (12, 1, 7, 9, 12)

- Cycle 17: (3, 9, 11, 2, 3)
- Cycle 18: (3, 11, 1, 0, 3)
- Cycle 19: (3, 11, 2, 14, 3)
- Cycle 20: (9, 10, 5, 1, 9)
- Cycle 21: (9, 10, 4, 7, 9)
- Cycle 22: (9, 11, 0, 6, 9)
- Cycle 23: (9, 11, 3, 8, 9)
- Cycle 24: (9, 11, 2, 14, 9)
- Cycle 25: (0, 6, 13, 7, 0)
- Cycle 26: (0, 6, 12, 1, 0)
- Cycle 27: (0, 6, 14, 2, 0)
- Cycle 28: (0, 1, 5, 10, 0)

Step 2: List of cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <4, (5, 10), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (1, 7), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, (9, 7), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (14, 6), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, (12, 13), 7>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [23]
