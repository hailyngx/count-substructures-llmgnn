Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:  
- (4, 7, 2, 5)
- (4, 7, 9, 2)
- (4, 7, 9, 6)
- (4, 9, 6, 5)
- (4, 9, 8, 5)
- (4, 9, 3, 1)
- (4, 9, 3, 7)
- (4, 5, 6, 9)
- (4, 5, 2, 7)
- (4, 6, 9, 8)
- (7, 9, 6, 4)
- (7, 9, 4, 3)
- (7, 9, 8, 5)
- (7, 2, 5, 4)
- (1, 3, 9, 4)
- (1, 3, 4, 6)
- (1, 3, 9, 7)
- (3, 9, 6, 4)
- (3, 9, 4, 7)
- (6, 9, 4, 5)
- (6, 9, 8, 4)
- (6, 5, 4, 9)
- (6, 5, 2, 7)
- (9, 4, 7, 2)
- (9, 4, 3, 1)
- (9, 4, 5, 6)
- (9, 4, 6, 8)
- (9, 7, 2, 5)
- (9, 7, 3, 1)
- (9, 6, 4, 5)
- (9, 6, 5, 8)
- (5, 4, 6, 9)
- (5, 4, 7, 2)
- (5, 4, 9, 8)
- (5, 6, 4, 9)
- (5, 6, 9, 8)

Step 2:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <4, (7, 2), 5>.

Step 3:
Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
