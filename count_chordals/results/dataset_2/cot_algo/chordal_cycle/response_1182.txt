Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-9-3-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-9-7-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-9-3-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-9-7-1
- Cycle 6: 1-3-9-7-1
- Cycle 7: 1-2-9-5-1
- Cycle 8: 1-2-9-3-1
- Cycle 9: 1-2-9-7-1
- Cycle 10: 1-2-8-7-1
- Cycle 11: 3-6-9-1-3
- Cycle 12: 3-6-9-7-3
- Cycle 13: 4-1-5-9-4
- Cycle 14: 4-1-6-9-4
- Cycle 15: 4-1-3-9-4
- Cycle 16: 4-1-7-9-4
- Cycle 17: 4-3-9-1-4
- Cycle 18: 4-3-6-9-4
- Cycle 19: 8-2-9-5-8
- Cycle 20: 8-2-1-5-8
- Cycle 21: 8-2-1-6-8
- Cycle 22: 8-2-1-3-8
- Cycle 23: 8-2-7-9-8
- Cycle 24: 8-2-7-6-8

Step 2: 
The cycles that have exactly one chord (forming a 4-cycle) are:
- Chordal 4-Cycle 1: <1, 5, 9, 6> (Chord: (1, 6))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 2: <1, 5, 9, 3> (Chord: (1, 3))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 3: <1, 6, 9, 3> (Chord: (1, 3))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 4: <1, 2, 9, 5> (Chord: (1, 2))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 5: <1, 2, 9, 3> (Chord: (1, 2))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 6: <1, 2, 8, 7> (Chord: (1, 2))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 7: <4, 1, 5, 9> (Chord: (4, 5))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 8: <4, 1, 6, 9> (Chord: (4, 6))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 9: <4, 1, 3, 9> (Chord: (4, 3))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 10: <4, 1, 7, 9> (Chord: (4, 7))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 11: <8, 2, 9, 5> (Chord: (8, 5))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 12: <8, 2, 1, 5> (Chord: (8, 5))

Step 3:
Total number of chordless 4-cycles = [12]
