Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 6 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 6 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 6 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 6 - 8 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 6: 0 - 6 - 3 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 7: 0 - 6 - 5 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 8: 0 - 6 - 3 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 9: 0 - 6 - 8 - 4 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 10: 0 - 6 - 3 - 1 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 11: 0 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 12: 0 - 6 - 3 - 7 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 13: 0 - 6 - 8 - 4 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 14: 0 - 6 - 5 - 3 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 15: 0 - 6 - 3 - 1 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 16: 0 - 6 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 17: 0 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 18: 0 - 6 - 3 - 7 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 19: 0 - 6 - 8 - 4 - 0 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 20: 0 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 0 - 3 - 0

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 16 has one chord: (6, 4) connecting non-adjacent nodes 6 and 4.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 19 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [19].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found (along with the chord): <16, (6, 4)>
