Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 1, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 1, 3, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 5, 3, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 7, 1, 6)
- Cycle 5: (9, 1, 3, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 7, 1, 9)
- Cycle 7: (1, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 8: (3, 4, 8, 3)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 3, 4)
- Cycle 10: (8, 5, 3, 8)
- Cycle 11: (5, 8, 3, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 13: (5, 2, 8, 5)
- Cycle 14: (5, 0, 4, 5)
- Cycle 15: (2, 9, 7, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 1)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (5, 3)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (6, 1)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (7, 1)
- No other cycles have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Since only 6 cycles have exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<6, (9, 1), 6)>
<2, (1, 3), 2)>
<3, (5, 3), 3)>
<4, (6, 1), 4)>
<5, (7, 1), 5)>
<5, (1, 3), 5)>
