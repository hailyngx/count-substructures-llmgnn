Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 20) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 0) (18, 29) (15, 8) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 24) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 1) (17, 27) (29, 18) (19, 15) (19, 26) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 7) (6, 10) (6, 22) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 23) (0, 8) (0, 18) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 16) (25, 22) (25, 10) (11, 2) (11, 26) (11, 23) (23, 26) (23, 28) (23, 11) (23, 16) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 26) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 23) (16, 12) (1, 2) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 4) (27, 17) (27, 24) (27, 14) (3, 24) (14, 4) (14, 27) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 15) (24, 27) (24, 3) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 25) (22, 6) (22, 25) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:  
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 28, 23, 26, 7, 25, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 10, 28, 23, 26, 19, 15, 8, 13, 20, 1, 4, 9)
- Cycle 4: (8, 13, 20, 15, 19, 26, 11, 2, 18, 24, 27, 14, 4, 9)
- Cycle 5: (8, 15, 19, 26, 7, 16, 12, 2, 11, 23, 28, 10, 5, 9)
- Cycle 6: (8, 24, 18, 2, 1, 25, 7, 26, 19, 10, 5, 28, 10, 6)
- Cycle 7: (13, 20, 1, 2, 18, 24, 3, 27, 14, 4, 1)
- Cycle 8: (18, 2, 11, 26, 19, 15, 24, 3, 27, 14, 27, 24)
- Cycle 9: (18, 24, 3, 27, 14, 4, 1, 25, 22, 6, 10, 28, 23)
- Cycle 10: (20, 15, 24, 18, 29, 19, 10, 5, 1, 25, 22, 6, 10)

Step 2:  
Out of the cycles listed, the chordal 4-cycles are:  
- Cycle 7: <13, (20, 1), 27, (4, 5)>
- Cycle 8: <18, (11, 26), 27, (1, 24)>
- Cycle 10: <20, (15, 24), 5, (1, 25)>

Step 3:  
The number of chordless cycles found is 7.  
Therefore, the final count is [7].
