Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 14) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
1. (6, 9, 4, 9, 6)
2. (6, 9, 10, 6)
3. (6, 9, 3, 8, 6)
4. (6, 9, 7, 8, 6)
5. (6, 1, 11, 10, 6)
6. (6, 1, 11, 0, 6)
7. (6, 1, 2, 7, 6)
8. (6, 1, 2, 7, 12, 0, 6)
9. (6, 1, 12, 7, 2, 1)
10. (6, 1, 12, 7, 0, 6)
11. (6, 10, 9, 3, 8, 6)
12. (6, 10, 9, 7, 8, 6)
13. (6, 11, 1, 2, 7, 6)
14. (6, 11, 1, 12, 7, 6)
15. (6, 11, 0, 7, 12, 1, 6)
16. (6, 0, 11, 1, 2, 7, 6)
17. (6, 0, 11, 5, 13, 8, 6)
18. (6, 0, 7, 13, 8, 6)
19. (6, 0, 7, 12, 1, 6)
20. (6, 0, 14, 12, 1, 6)
21. (9, 6, 1, 11, 10, 9)
22. (9, 6, 1, 2, 7, 9)
23. (9, 6, 1, 12, 7, 9)
24. (9, 4, 9)
25. (9, 4, 9, 10, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<6, 9, 10, 6> has one chord (9, 4) which forms a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There is a total of [1] chordal 4-cycle found.

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<6, 9, 10, 6> with chord (9, 4)
