Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-2-8-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-7-0-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-4-9-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-8-2-5
- Cycle 5: 5-7-0-3-5
- Cycle 6: 9-7-0-3-9
- Cycle 7: 9-7-2-8-9
- Cycle 8: 1-8-2-9-1
- Cycle 9: 1-4-0-3-1
- Cycle 10: 4-3-0-6-4
- Cycle 11: 2-8-0-6-2
- Cycle 12: 2-9-4-0-2
- Cycle 13: 7-5-1-8-7
- Cycle 14: 7-9-4-3-7

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <5, (9, 2), 8>
- Cycle 2: <5, (9, 7), 0>
- Cycle 3: <5, (1, 4), 9>
- Cycle 4: <5, (1, 8), 2>
- Cycle 5: <5, (7, 0), 3>
- Cycle 6: <9, (7, 0), 3>
- Cycle 7: <9, (7, 2), 8>
- Cycle 8: <1, (8, 2), 9>
- Cycle 9: <1, (4, 0), 3>
- Cycle 10: <4, (3, 0), 6>
- Cycle 11: <2, (8, 0), 6>
- Cycle 12: <2, (9, 4), 0>
- Cycle 13: <7, (9, 4), 1>
- Cycle 14: <7, (9, 4), 3>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [14]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, (9, 2), 8>
<5, (9, 7), 0>
<5, (1, 4), 9>
<5, (1, 8), 2>
<5, (7, 0), 3>
<9, (7, 0), 3>
<9, (7, 2), 8>
<1, (8, 2), 9>
<1, (4, 0), 3>
<4, (3, 0), 6>
<2, (8, 0), 6>
<2, (9, 4), 0>
<7, (9, 4), 1>
<7, (9, 4), 3>
