Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (6, 16) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 7) (18, 8) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (5, 15) (5, 19) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 16) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 19) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 16) (16, 15) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 7) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 17) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 2, 14, 0, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 16, 6, 16, 12, 13, 1, 9, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 15, 16, 12, 13, 1, 19, 7, 18, 8, 10, 4, 13, 11, 9, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 10, 8, 18, 7, 19, 1, 13, 4, 10)
- Cycle 5: (15, 2, 17, 8, 18, 7, 19, 5, 15)
- Cycle 6: (15, 16, 6, 16, 12, 13, 4, 10, 3, 15)
- Cycle 7: (9, 3, 15, 2, 14, 0, 8, 10, 4, 13, 11, 9)
- Cycle 8: (11, 9, 3, 15, 16, 12, 13, 4, 10, 8, 0, 14, 2, 11)
- Cycle 9: (2, 15, 16, 6, 16, 12, 13, 4, 10, 8, 18, 7, 19, 5, 2)
- Cycle 10: (18, 7, 19, 5, 15, 16, 6, 16, 12, 13, 4, 10, 8, 17, 2, 18)
- Cycle 11: (0, 3, 15, 2, 14, 0)
- Cycle 12: (0, 14, 2, 15, 16, 6, 16, 12, 13, 1, 9, 3, 10, 8, 0)
- Cycle 13: (5, 15, 16, 6, 16, 7, 18, 8, 17, 2, 14, 0, 5)
- Cycle 14: (13, 11, 9, 3, 10, 8, 18, 7, 19, 1, 13)
- Cycle 15: (13, 4, 10, 8, 17, 2, 15, 5, 19, 7, 16, 12, 13)
- Cycle 16: (19, 5, 15, 16, 6, 16, 12, 13, 1, 19)
- Cycle 17: (4, 10, 8, 18, 7, 16, 6, 16, 12, 13, 4)
- Cycle 18: (12, 13, 4, 10, 8, 18, 7, 19, 5, 15, 2, 14, 0, 12)
- Cycle 19: (1, 9, 3, 10, 8, 18, 7, 19, 5, 15, 2, 17, 8, 10, 4, 1)
- Cycle 20: (7, 18, 8, 17, 2, 14, 0, 3, 9, 11, 13, 4, 12, 16, 15, 7)

Step 2: 
From the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles are as follows:
- <1, (13, 4), 10, (8, 17), 2>
- <2, (8, 18), 7, (19, 5), 15>
- <16, (6, 12), 13, (4, 10), 3>
- <3, (15, 2), 14, (0, 8), 10>

Step 3: 
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, so the final count is [4].
