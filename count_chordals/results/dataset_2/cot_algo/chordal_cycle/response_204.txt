Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (1, 5) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 0, 8>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 12, 7>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 12, 13>
- Cycle 4: <5, 11, 3, 4>
- Cycle 5: <5, 1, 2, 3>
- Cycle 6: <5, 7, 14, 10>
- Cycle 7: <5, 7, 6, 0>
- Cycle 8: <9, 12, 7, 14>
- Cycle 9: <9, 12, 2, 0>
- Cycle 10: <13, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle 11: <13, 4, 3, 2>
- Cycle 12: <13, 14, 10, 9>
- Cycle 13: <4, 6, 0, 2>
- Cycle 14: <7, 14, 10, 3>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- Chordal 4-Cycle 1: <5, 9, 12, 7, (5, 7)>

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
