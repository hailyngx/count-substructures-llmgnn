Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <1, 6, 8, 5, 1>
2. Cycle <3, 4, 5, 8, 3>
3. Cycle <4, 5, 7, 1, 4>
4. Cycle <7, 1, 8, 6, 7>
5. Cycle <9, 3, 4, 5, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Cycle <1, 6, 8, 5, 1> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (6, 8).
2. Cycle <3, 4, 5, 8, 3> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (4, 8).
3. Cycle <7, 1, 8, 6, 7> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (1, 6).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final number is [3]. 

The chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 6, 8, 5, 1> (chord: (6, 8))
<3, 4, 5, 8, 3> (chord: (4, 8))
<7, 1, 8, 6, 7> (chord: (1, 6))
