Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 9, 2, 8, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 9, 2, 8, 5, 2, 9, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 9, 3, 0, 2, 9, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 9, 3, 5, 5, 1)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, 2, 8, 9>
- Cycle 2: <1, 2, 8, 9>
- Cycle 3: No chord (Already a chordless cycle)
- Cycle 4: No chord (Already a chordless cycle)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 2, 8, 9>
<1, 9, 3, 0>
