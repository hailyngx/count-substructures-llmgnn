Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle <0, 1, 4, 8>
- Cycle <0, 1, 7, 5>
- Cycle <0, 2, 5, 3>
- Cycle <1, 4, 9, 7>
- Cycle <2, 0, 8, 7>
- Cycle <3, 0, 8, 7>
- Cycle <4, 1, 9, 7>
- Cycle <5, 2, 0, 8>
- Cycle <5, 3, 0, 8>
- Cycle <6, 9, 1, 4>
- Cycle <6, 9, 7, 5>
- Cycle <6, 7, 5, 2>
- Cycle <6, 7, 8, 0>
- Cycle <6, 7, 9, 4>
- Cycle <9, 8, 0, 2>
- Cycle <9, 8, 7, 5>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (a single edge connecting non-adjacent nodes) are:
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, 4, 8> with chord (1, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, 7, 5> with chord (1, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 0, 8, 7> with chord (0, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, 7, 5, 2> with chord (7, 5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have a total of [4].
