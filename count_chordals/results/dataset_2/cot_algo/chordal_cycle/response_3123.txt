Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 17) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 12) (12, 8) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 0) (1, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 18) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 13) (18, 13) (18, 3) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 14) (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 5)

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-11-16-5-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-11-16-14-0
        - Cycle 3: 0-17-19-15-0
        - Cycle 4: 0-17-19-10-0
        - Cycle 5: 0-7-15-9-6-0
        - Cycle 6: 0-7-15-4-3-18-0
        - Cycle 7: 0-7-15-9-8-16-11-0
        - Cycle 8: 0-7-15-9-14-1-14-16-0
        - Cycle 9: 0-7-15-9-8-16-14-0
        - Cycle 10: 0-6-9-8-16-11-0
        - Cycle 11: 0-6-9-14-16-5-15-0
        - Cycle 12: 0-6-9-14-1-14-16-5-0
        - Cycle 13: 0-6-9-8-12-8-16-11-0
        - Cycle 14: 0-6-13-11-16-14-9-0
        - Cycle 15: 0-6-13-11-16-5-15-0
        - Cycle 16: 0-6-13-10-19-7-15-0
        - Cycle 17: 0-6-13-10-19-7-0
        - Cycle 18: 0-6-13-10-19-15-7-4-3-18-0
        - Cycle 19: 4-7-0-17-19-10-13-18-3-5-14-9-15-4
        - Cycle 20: 4-7-15-9-6-0-11-16-14-5-3-4

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (11, 16), 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (11, 16), 14>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (17, 19), 15>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, (17, 19), 10>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (7, 15), 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <0, (7, 15), (3, 18)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <0, (7, 15), (9, 16)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <0, (7, 15), (1, 14)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <0, (7, 15), (8, 16)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <0, (6, 9), 8>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <0, (6, 9), 14>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <0, (6, 13), 11>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <0, (6, 13), (10, 19)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 14: <7, (19, 10), 13>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 15: <4, (17, 3), 18>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 16: <4, (7, 15), 9>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        We have found 16 chordal 4-cycles, so the answer is [16].
