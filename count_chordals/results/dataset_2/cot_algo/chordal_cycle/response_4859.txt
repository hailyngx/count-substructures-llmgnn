Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 9, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 0, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 5: (6, 9, 8, 3, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 2, 3, 8, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 0, 7, 9, 6)
- Cycle 8: (9, 8, 3, 2, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 1, 4, 5, 9)
- Cycle 10: (1, 7, 0, 6, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 4, 8, 2, 1)
- Cycle 12: (4, 3, 8, 2, 4)
- Cycle 13: (8, 9, 6, 0, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 3, 2, 6, 8)
- Cycle 15: (2, 8, 4, 5, 2)
- Cycle 16: (2, 3, 4, 1, 2)
- Cycle 17: (3, 8, 4, 1, 3)
- Cycle 18: (7, 0, 5, 4, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 4 has a chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (4, 5)
- Cycle 18 has a chord (0, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

We found 15 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 0, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9, 7>
<6, 9, 8, 3>
<6, 0, 7, 9>
<9, 8, 3, 2>
<9, 1, 4, 5>
<1, 7, 0, 6>
<1, 4, 8, 2>
<4, 3, 8, 2>
<8, 9, 6, 0>
<8, 3, 2, 6>
<2, 8, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 4, 1>
<3, 8, 4, 1>
<7, 0, 5, 4>
