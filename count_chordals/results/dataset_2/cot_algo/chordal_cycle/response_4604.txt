Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 10, 13)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 13, 0)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 0, 7)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 7, 2)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 2, 6)
- Cycle 6: (5, 11, 1, 13)
- Cycle 7: (5, 11, 3, 7)
- Cycle 8: (5, 11, 10, 13)
- Cycle 9: (5, 11, 4, 8)
- Cycle 10: (5, 14, 6, 7)
- Cycle 11: (5, 14, 8, 12)
- Cycle 12: (5, 3, 11, 4)
- Cycle 13: (9, 10, 12, 8)
- Cycle 14: (9, 10, 13, 4)
- Cycle 15: (9, 13, 1, 12)
- Cycle 16: (9, 13, 0, 7)
- Cycle 17: (9, 14, 6, 7)
- Cycle 18: (9, 14, 8, 12)
- Cycle 19: (9, 0, 7, 2)
- Cycle 20: (6, 7, 3, 11)
- Cycle 21: (6, 7, 0, 13)
- Cycle 22: (6, 14, 8, 12)
- Cycle 23: (1, 13, 9, 10)
- Cycle 24: (3, 11, 10, 13)
- Cycle 25: (3, 11, 4, 8)
- Cycle 26: (10, 13, 0, 7)
- Cycle 27: (10, 13, 4, 8)
- Cycle 28: (11, 4, 8, 12)
- Cycle 29: (7, 0, 13, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (10, 13), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (13, 0), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (9, 0), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (9, 2), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (11, 1), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, (11, 3), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, (11, 4), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, (14, 6), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <5, (14, 8), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (12, 8), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <10, (13, 4), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <13, (1, 12), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <3, (11, 10), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <3, (11, 4), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <7, (0, 13), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
So, the final count is [15].
