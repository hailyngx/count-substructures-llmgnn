Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-6-5
- Cycle 2: 9-2-6-1-9
- Cycle 3: 9-2-4-7-9
- Cycle 4: 6-1-4-7-6
- Cycle 5: 4-7-2-8-4
- Cycle 6: 5-3-1-6-5
- Cycle 7: 8-2-7-9-8

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- For Cycle 1, there are no chords.
- For Cycle 2, there are no chords.
- For Cycle 3, there is one chord: (2, 7).
- For Cycle 4, there is one chord: (1, 7).
- For Cycle 5, there is one chord: (7, 8).
- For Cycle 6, there are no chords.
- For Cycle 7, there is one chord: (2, 9).

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<3, (2, 7)>
<4, (1, 7)>
<5, (7, 8)>
