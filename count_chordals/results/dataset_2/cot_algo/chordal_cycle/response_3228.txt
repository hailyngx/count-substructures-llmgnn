30. (7, 5, 11, 4, 9)
31. (7, 14, 19, 16, 18)
32. (10, 4, 9, 6, 5)
33. (10, 13, 2, 8, 9)
34. (10, 12, 9, 4, 0)
35. (17, 8, 9, 4, 0)
36. (2, 8, 9, 4, 0)
37. (2, 13, 10, 4, 9)
38. (2, 0, 4, 9, 6)
39. (18, 16, 19, 14, 7)
40. (5, 6, 9, 4, 0)
41. (5, 7, 15, 8, 9)
42. (5, 11, 4, 9, 6)
43. (8, 9, 4, 0, 3)
44. (8, 15, 1, 19, 14)
45. (8, 2, 13, 10, 4)
46. (8, 17, 9, 4, 0)
47. (11, 6, 5, 7, 1)
48. (11, 3, 13, 10, 4)
49. (11, 4, 9, 8, 2)
50. (11, 5, 7, 1, 19)
51. (15, 1, 19, 14, 7)
52. (15, 7, 5, 6, 9)
53. (15, 8, 9, 4, 0)
54. (12, 9, 4, 0, 3)
55. (16, 18, 17, 8, 2)
56. (16, 19, 14, 7, 5)
57. (0, 6, 5, 7, 1)
58. (0, 3, 13, 10, 4)
59. (0, 4, 9, 8, 2)
60. (0, 2, 13, 10, 4)

Step 2:
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <6, (9, 8), 2, 0>
2. <9, (4, 10), 13, 2>
3. <6, (5, 7), 1, 15>
4. <1, (19, 14), 7, 15>
5. <3, (0, 4), 9, 6>
6. <7, (5, 11), 4, 9>
7. <15, (1, 19), 7, 14>
8. <16, (18, 17), 8, 2>

Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [8].
