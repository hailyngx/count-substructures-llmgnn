Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 13) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 9) (15, 1) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 8) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 18) (19, 3) (19, 12) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 18) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 1) (8, 17) (8, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (4, 16) (4, 3) (2, 6) (2, 16) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 14) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
        - Cycle 1: 5-6-16-7-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-7-13-17-5
        - Cycle 3: 6-16-4-3-6
        - Cycle 4: 0-11-1-9-0
        - Cycle 5: 0-11-5-12-0
        - Cycle 6: 0-11-1-15-0
        - Cycle 7: 0-12-19-18-0
        - Cycle 8: 5-12-14-8-5
        - Cycle 9: 6-2-16-7-6
        - Cycle 10: 7-5-12-14-7
        - Cycle 11: 7-13-9-18-7
        - Cycle 12: 7-13-17-8-7
        - Cycle 13: 1-11-5-12-1
        - Cycle 14: 1-11-0-18-1
        - Cycle 15: 1-15-11-0-1
        - Cycle 16: 13-17-8-14-13
        - Cycle 17: 13-9-1-15-13
        - Cycle 18: 13-9-18-19-13
        - Cycle 19: 16-4-3-19-16
        - Cycle 20: 16-2-6-5-16
        - Cycle 21: 16-7-13-17-16
        - Cycle 22: 18-0-11-5-18
        - Cycle 23: 18-19-12-14-18
        - Cycle 24: 18-9-1-15-18
        - Cycle 25: 19-3-4-16-19
        - Cycle 26: 19-12-5-14-19
        
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Only Cycle 2 <5, 13, (7, 17)> has exactly one chord.
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the count is [1].
