Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 10, 13, 5, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 10, 13, 2, 12, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 10, 7, 5, 13, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 10, 7, 13, 2, 12, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 10, 11, 0, 4, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 10, 11, 0, 13, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 10, 7, 13, 0, 4, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 4, 0, 11, 10, 7, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 4, 0, 13, 10, 7, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 4, 14, 5, 7, 10, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 1, 12, 3, 14, 4, 6)
- Cycle 12: (9, 7, 10, 6, 4, 0, 9)
- Cycle 13: (9, 7, 10, 11, 0, 13, 9)
- Cycle 14: (9, 6, 4, 14, 12, 1, 9)
- Cycle 15: (9, 7, 13, 0, 11, 10, 9)
- Cycle 16: (9, 7, 5, 13, 10, 6, 9)
- Cycle 17: (9, 7, 5, 14, 12, 1, 9)
- Cycle 18: (9, 7, 5, 8, 1, 12, 9)

Step 2: 
Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, (10, 13), 5, 6>
- <6, (10, 13), 2, 12, 6>
- <6, (10, 7), 5, 13, 6>
- <6, (10, 7), 13, 2, 12, 6>
- <6, (10, 11), 0, 4, 6>
- <6, (10, 11), 0, 13, 6>
- <6, (10, 7), 13, 0, 4, 6>
- <6, 4, 0, (11, 10), 7, 6>
- <6, 4, 0, (13, 10), 7, 6>
- <6, 4, (14, 5), 7, 10, 6>
- <6, 1, 12, 3, (14, 4), 6>
- <9, 7, (10, 6), 4, 0, 9>
- <9, 7, (10, 11), 0, 13, 9>
- <9, 6, 4, 14, (12, 1), 9>
- <9, 7, 13, 0, (11, 10), 9>
- <9, 7, 5, 13, (10, 6), 9>
- <9, 7, 5, 14, (12, 1), 9>
- <9, 7, 5, (8, 1), 12, 9>

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 17 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [17].
