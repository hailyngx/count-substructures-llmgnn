Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (7, 0, 5, 1, 7)
- Cycle 2: (7, 0, 5, 4, 1, 7)
- Cycle 3: (7, 1, 6, 10, 5, 0, 7)
- Cycle 4: (7, 1, 9, 4, 5, 0, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 6, 2, 13, 12, 3, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 6, 10, 5, 4, 11, 14, 13, 2, 14, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 14, 13, 12, 3, 9, 4, 11, 6, 10, 8, 5, 0, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Checking Cycle 1: (7, 0, 5, 1, 7) <No chord>
- Checking Cycle 2: (7, 0, 5, 4, 1, 7) <Chord: (0, 1)>
- Checking Cycle 3: (7, 1, 6, 10, 5, 0, 7) <Chord: (1, 5)>
- Checking Cycle 4: (7, 1, 9, 4, 5, 0, 7) <No chord>
- Checking Cycle 5: (7, 6, 2, 13, 12, 3, 7) <No chord>
- Checking Cycle 6: (7, 6, 10, 5, 4, 11, 14, 13, 2, 14, 7) <Chord: (6, 14)>
- Checking Cycle 7: (7, 14, 13, 12, 3, 9, 4, 11, 6, 10, 8, 5, 0, 7) <Chord: (9, 8)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 4 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<7, 0, 5, 1, 7>
<7, 1, 9, 4, 5, 0, 7>
<7, 6, 2, 13, 12, 3, 7>
<7, 14, 13, 12, 3, 9, 4, 11, 6, 10, 8, 5, 0, 7>
