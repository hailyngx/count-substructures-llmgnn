Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 2, 7, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 11, 8, 5, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 13, 12, 9)
- Cycle 5: (6, 7, 2, 1, 6)
- Cycle 6: (4, 10, 11, 14, 4)
- Cycle 7: (10, 2, 1, 6, 7, 10)
- Cycle 8: (11, 3, 8, 13, 9, 11)
- Cycle 9: (8, 5, 9, 13, 8)
- Cycle 10: (13, 12, 8, 5, 2, 1, 0, 13)
- Cycle 11: (1, 9, 13, 0, 1)
- Cycle 12: (6, 7, 2, 10, 14, 11, 3, 6)
- Cycle 13: (4, 10, 2, 1, 0, 13, 12, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord (6, 9) forming the chordal 4-cycle <1, (6, 9), 5>.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (2, 6) forming the chordal 4-cycle <2, (2, 6), 5>.
- Cycle 3 has a chord (11, 8) forming the chordal 4-cycle <3, (11, 8), 9>.
- Cycle 6 has a chord (10, 14) forming the chordal 4-cycle <6, (10, 14), 4>.
- Cycle 7 has a chord (6, 10) forming the chordal 4-cycle <7, (6, 10), 2>.
- Cycle 9 has a chord (5, 13) forming the chordal 4-cycle <9, (5, 13), 8>.
- Cycle 10 has a chord (8, 13) forming the chordal 4-cycle <10, (8, 13), 9>.
- Cycle 11 has a chord (9, 13) forming the chordal 4-cycle <11, (9, 13), 1>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
