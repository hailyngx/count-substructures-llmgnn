Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 0, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 4, 8, 0, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 0, 9, 5) has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 6, 2, 5) has a chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 3, 6, 5) has a chord (7, 6)
- Cycle 4: (9, 4, 8, 0, 9) has a chord (4, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (5, 9), 0, 5>
- <1, (5, 6), 2, 5>
- <7, (5, 6), 3, 5>
- <4, (9, 0), 8, 9>
