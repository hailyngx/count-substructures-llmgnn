Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 4) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (18, 10) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 16) (6, 10) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 0) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 19) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 9) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 13) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 9) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 9) (12, 19) (12, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 9) (9, 1) (9, 16) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 3 - 4 - 14 - 15 - 3
- Cycle 2: 2 - 4 - 0 - 13 - 2
- Cycle 3: 7 - 1 - 11 - 5 - 7
- Cycle 4: 0 - 10 - 6 - 8 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 5: 16 - 5 - 11 - 13 - 16
- Cycle 6: 9 - 1 - 7 - 2 - 13 - 9
- Cycle 7: 12 - 9 - 19 - 17 - 3 - 12
- Cycle 8: 15 - 14 - 4 - 0 - 13 - 11 - 1 - 9 - 12 - 19 - 17 - 16 - 5 - 8 - 6 - 10 - 18 - 12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord: <3, (4, 14), 15>
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <2, (0, 13), 4>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <7, (1, 11), 5>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: <0, (6, 8), 10>
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <16, (5, 11), 13>
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <9, (7, 13), 1>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <12, (9, 19), 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
