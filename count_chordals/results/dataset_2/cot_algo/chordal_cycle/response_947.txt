Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 9) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 7-12-13-11-3-6-7
- Cycle 2: 7-12-14-11-3-6-7
- Cycle 3: 7-12-14-11-4-1-7
- Cycle 4: 7-12-13-11-4-1-7
- Cycle 5: 7-1-6-3-11-14-7
- Cycle 6: 7-1-6-3-8-12-7
- Cycle 7: 7-1-6-3-9-11-7
- Cycle 8: 7-1-6-3-8-12-13-11-4-7
- Cycle 9: 7-1-6-3-11-4-10-0-2-7
- Cycle 10: 12-13-11-3-6-7-14-12
- Cycle 11: 12-13-11-4-1-6-7-14-12
- Cycle 12: 12-14-7-1-6-3-11-13-12
- Cycle 13: 12-14-7-1-6-3-11-4-12
- Cycle 14: 12-13-11-4-10-0-2-7-8-12
- Cycle 15: 12-13-11-9-3-6-7-8-12

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: {1, 4}
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: {1, 4}
- Cycle 11 has exactly one chord: {1, 6}
- Cycle 12 has exactly one chord: {1, 6}
- Cycle 14 has exactly one chord: {10, 2}
- Cycle 15 has exactly one chord: {8, 6}

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<7, 12, 13, 11>
<7, 12, 14, 11>
<7, 12, 14, 11>
<7, 1, 6, 3>
<12, 13, 11, 3>
<12, 13, 11, 9>
