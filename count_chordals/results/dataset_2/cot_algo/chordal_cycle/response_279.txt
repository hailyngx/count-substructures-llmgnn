Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 19) (10, 5) (17, 12) (17, 4) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 16) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 11) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 11) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (8, 6) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 16) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 1) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 15) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 3) (3, 19) (3, 7) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- 4-cycle: <0, 2, 12, 1>
- 4-cycle: <0, 12, 17, 4>
- 4-cycle: <0, 2, 13, 1>
- 4-cycle: <0, 12, 2, 13>
- 4-cycle: <4, 17, 12, 2>
- 4-cycle: <4, 17, 12, 1>
- 4-cycle: <5, 1, 12, 2>
- 4-cycle: <5, 1, 12, 17>
- 4-cycle: <7, 16, 19, 10>
- 4-cycle: <7, 16, 14, 1>
- 4-cycle: <11, 2, 0, 12>
- 4-cycle: <11, 2, 13, 1>
- 4-cycle: <11, 4, 17, 12>
- 4-cycle: <11, 15, 16, 7>
- 4-cycle: <12, 17, 4, 11>
- 4-cycle: <13, 2, 0, 12>
- 4-cycle: <13, 1, 12, 17>
- 4-cycle: <15, 9, 0, 12>
- 4-cycle: <15, 9, 7, 14>

Step 2:
- <0, 2, (12), 1>
- <4, 17, (12), 2>
- <4, (17), 12, 1>
- <5, 1, (12), 2>
- <7, (16), 19, 10>
- <7, 16, (14), 1>
- <11, 2, 0, (12)>
- <11, 2, (13), 1>
- <11, 4, (17), 12>
- <11, (15), 16, 7>
- <13, 2, 0, (12)>
- <13, 1, (12), 17>
- <15, 9, 0, (12)>
- <15, 9, 7, (14)>

Step 3:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [14].
