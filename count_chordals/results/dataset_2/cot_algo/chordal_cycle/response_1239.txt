Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 16) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 17) (11, 3) (11, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (5, 18) (5, 17) (1, 18) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 19) (14, 16) (14, 10) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 10) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 17) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 15) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 15) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 15) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 6, 10, 14)
- Cycle 2: (4, 6, 10, 16)
- Cycle 3: (7, 10, 14, 16)
- Cycle 4: (2, 18, 5, 17)
- Cycle 5: (2, 18, 1, 10)
- Cycle 6: (2, 18, 1, 7)
- Cycle 7: (2, 18, 1, 10)
- Cycle 8: (2, 18, 1, 7)
- Cycle 9: (10, 14, 16, 19)
- Cycle 10: (10, 16, 19, 6)
- Cycle 11: (10, 14, 16, 19)
- Cycle 12: (10, 16, 19, 6)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (4, 10), 6> has one chord
- <2, (18, 1), 10> has one chord
- <3, (10, 16), 14> has one chord

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (4, 10), 6>
- <2, (18, 1), 10>
- <3, (10, 16), 14>
