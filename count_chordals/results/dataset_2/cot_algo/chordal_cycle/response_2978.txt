Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 18, 14, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 25, 19, 14>
- Cycle 3: <0, 10, 26, 1>
- Cycle 4: <0, 10, 3, 12>
- Cycle 5: <0, 24, 4, 22>
- Cycle 6: <0, 24, 16, 8>
- Cycle 7: <0, 24, 9, 11>
- Cycle 8: <1, 26, 10, 0>
- Cycle 9: <1, 12, 25, 19>
- Cycle 10: <4, 22, 5, 14>
- Cycle 11: <4, 24, 0, 18>
- Cycle 12: <4, 24, 16, 8>
- Cycle 13: <4, 24, 9, 11>
- Cycle 14: <5, 14, 17, 11>
- Cycle 15: <5, 13, 22, 4>
- Cycle 16: <7, 14, 18, 3>
- Cycle 17: <7, 11, 17, 14>
- Cycle 18: <7, 26, 1, 12>
- Cycle 19: <7, 15, 25, 19>
- Cycle 20: <8, 16, 24, 4>
- Cycle 21: <8, 16, 6, 27>
- Cycle 22: <9, 11, 17, 14>
- Cycle 23: <9, 24, 4, 22>
- Cycle 24: <10, 26, 1, 12>
- Cycle 25: <11, 15, 7, 26>
- Cycle 26: <11, 9, 24, 4>
- Cycle 27: <11, 9, 24, 16>
- Cycle 28: <12, 25, 15, 7>
- Cycle 29: <12, 3, 18, 14>
- Cycle 30: <12, 29, 27, 6>
- Cycle 31: <13, 5, 14, 17>
- Cycle 32: <15, 25, 19, 23>
- Cycle 33: <16, 8, 27, 6>
- Cycle 34: <16, 24, 9, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycles found:
    - <0, 18, (14), 5>
    - <4, 24, (16), 8>
    - <7, 11, (17), 14>
    - <9, 24, (4), 22>
    - <10, 26, (1), 12>
    - <11, 9, (24), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [6].
