Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 9, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 9, 2, 3, 12, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 9, 2, 6, 0, 13, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 9, 2, 6, 14, 11, 12, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 9, 2, 3, 4, 14, 11, 12, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 9, 2, 3, 12, 11, 14, 6, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 9, 2, 6, 14, 13, 0, 11, 12, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 9, 2, 6, 0, 13, 4, 14, 12, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 9, 2, 3, 12, 11, 8, 7, 5, 10, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 9, 2, 3, 12, 11, 8, 7, 5, 12, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 9, 2, 6, 0, 11, 12, 3, 4, 13, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 9, 2, 6, 14, 4, 3, 12, 11, 8, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1: <1, 2, 6, 9> [1]
- Cycle 2: <1, 2, (3, 12), 9> [1]
- Cycle 3: <1, 2, 6, (0, 13), 9> [1]
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, (6, 14), 11, 12> [1]
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 3, (4, 14), 11, 12> [1]
- Cycle 6: <1, 2, 3, 12, (11, 14), 6> [1]
- Cycle 7: <1, 2, (6, 14), 13, 0, 11> [1]
- Cycle 8: <1, 2, 6, (0, 13), 4, 14> [1]
- Cycle 9: <1, 2, 3, 8, 11, 12, 10, 5, 7> [1]
- Cycle 10: <1, 2, 3, 8, 7, 5, 12, 10> [1]
- Cycle 11: <1, 2, (0, 11), 12, 3, 4, 13> [1]
- Cycle 12: <1, 2, (6, 14), 4, 3, 12, 11> [1]

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [12]
