Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 1-9-8-3-1
        - Cycle 2: 2-9-8-3-2
        - Cycle 3: 4-7-6-5-4
        - Cycle 4: 1-9-2-4-1
        - Cycle 5: 1-9-8-4-1
        - Cycle 6: 1-3-8-9-1
        - Cycle 7: 2-9-1-6-2
        - Cycle 8: 2-4-7-6-2
        - Cycle 9: 2-4-8-9-2
        - Cycle 10: 2-1-9-8-2
        - Cycle 11: 3-8-4-7-3
        - Cycle 12: 3-1-9-8-3
        - Cycle 13: 3-6-7-4-3
        - Cycle 14: 4-7-0-2-4
        - Cycle 15: 6-7-0-4-6
        - Cycle 16: 6-7-2-1-6
        - Cycle 17: 6-7-2-4-6

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
        - <1, (2, 4), 9>
        - <2, (1, 6), 9>
        - <4, (0, 7), 8>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [14]
