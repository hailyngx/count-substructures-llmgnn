Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (3, 5, 9, 3) with edges (3, 5), (5, 9), (9, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 12, 4, 13, 3) with edges (3, 12), (12, 4), (4, 13), (13, 3)
- Cycle 3: (4, 13, 2, 14, 4) with edges (4, 13), (13, 2), (2, 14), (14, 4)
- Cycle 4: (3, 6, 13, 4, 12, 3) with edges (3, 6), (6, 13), (13, 4), (4, 12), (12, 3)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 12, 1) with edges (1, 4), (4, 12), (12, 1)
- Cycle 6: (2, 13, 4, 1, 2) with edges (2, 13), (13, 4), (4, 1), (1, 2)
- Cycle 7: (1, 4, 13, 6, 3, 0, 1) with edges (1, 4), (4, 13), (13, 6), (6, 3), (3, 0), (0, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 7, 12, 4, 13, 2, 14, 1) with edges (1, 7), (7, 12), (12, 4), (4, 13), (13, 2), (2, 14), (14, 1)
- Cycle 9: (11, 14, 13, 4, 11) with edges (11, 14), (14, 13), (13, 4), (4, 11)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: <3, 5, (9, 3)>
- Cycle 2: <4, 12, (13, 3)>
- Cycle 3: <4, 13, (2, 14)>
- Cycle 4: <3, 6, (13, 4)>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, (12, 1)>
- Cycle 6: <2, 13, (4, 1)>
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, (13, 6)>
- Cycle 8: <1, 7, (12, 4)>
- Cycle 9: <11, 14, (13, 4)>

Step 3:
As there are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [9].
