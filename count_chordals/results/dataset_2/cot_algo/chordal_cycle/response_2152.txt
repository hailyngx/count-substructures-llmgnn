Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:

- Cycle 34: 5-0-2-7-5 
- Cycle 35: 5-4-11-1-5 
- Cycle 36: 5-14-9-0-5 
- Cycle 37: 3-2-7-9-3 
- Cycle 38: 3-4-11-14-3 
- Cycle 39: 13-6-12-0-13 

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, (10, 13), 6>.

Step 3:
Since there is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
