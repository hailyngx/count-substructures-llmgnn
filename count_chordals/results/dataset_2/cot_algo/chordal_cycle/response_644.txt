Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 11, 2, 14, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 11, 13, 4, 0, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 7, 6, 4, 0, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 12, 7, 6, 4, 3)
- Cycle 5: (9, 11, 2, 8, 10, 13, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 3, 12, 7, 6, 4, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 7, 12, 14, 2, 11, 9)
- Cycle 8: (4, 13, 10, 8, 2, 11, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 0, 5, 6, 7, 12, 4)
- Cycle 10: (7, 12, 14, 13, 10, 8, 7)
- Cycle 11: (10, 8, 2, 14, 13, 4, 10)
- Cycle 12: (11, 13, 12, 7, 6, 5, 11)
- Cycle 13: (12, 7, 6, 5, 0, 14, 12)
- Cycle 14: (2, 8, 10, 1, 12, 7, 2)
- Cycle 15: (0, 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 14), 13, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There is [1] unique chordal 4-cycle found.
