Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 12) (11, 15) (17, 18) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 16) (13, 3) (0, 1) (0, 16) (16, 19) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 10) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 14) (12, 11) (12, 5) (10, 16) (10, 8) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 8) (8, 16) (8, 10) (8, 18) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: {4, 6, 3, 1, 4}
- Cycle 2: {4, 6, 3, 13, 4}
- Cycle 3: {4, 6, 3, 11, 4}
- Cycle 4: {4, 6, 15, 14, 4}
- Cycle 5: {4, 6, 15, 14, 5, 19, 4}
- Cycle 6: {4, 19, 16, 0, 1, 4}
- Cycle 7: {4, 19, 16, 0, 1, 7, 14, 4}
- Cycle 8: {4, 19, 5, 2, 6, 4}
- Cycle 9: {4, 19, 11, 18, 14, 7, 1, 4}
- Cycle 10: {4, 19, 11, 18, 14, 15, 6, 2, 5, 4}
- Cycle 11: {6, 3, 13, 4, 19, 5, 2, 6}
- Cycle 12: {6, 3, 13, 4, 19, 16, 0, 1, 7, 14, 15, 6}
- Cycle 13: {6, 3, 1, 7, 14, 15, 6}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, (3, 1), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (19, 16), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, (6, 5), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]
