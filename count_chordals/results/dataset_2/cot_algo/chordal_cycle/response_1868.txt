Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 0, 9, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 3, 9, 2, 4)
- Cycle 3: (7, 4, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 4: (2, 4, 7, 8, 2)
- Cycle 5: (3, 9, 2, 7, 3)
- Cycle 6: (6, 5, 0, 7, 6)
- Cycle 7: (0, 9, 8, 7, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord (0, 9): <1, (0, 9), 5)>
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 9): <2, (4, 9), 2)>
- Cycle 3 has a chord (4, 3): <3, (4, 3), 7)>
- Cycle 4 has a chord (4, 8): <4, (4, 8), 2)>
- Cycle 5 has a chord (9, 2): <5, (9, 2), 3)>
- Cycle 6 has a chord (5, 0): <6, (5, 0), 7)>
- Cycle 7 has a chord (9, 8): <7, (9, 8), 0)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (0, 9), 5)>
<2, (4, 9), 2)>
<3, (4, 3), 7)>
<4, (4, 8), 2)>
<5, (9, 2), 3)>
<6, (5, 0), 7)>
<7, (9, 8), 0)>
