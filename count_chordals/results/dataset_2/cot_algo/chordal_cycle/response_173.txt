Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 10) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (7, 15) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 4) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 17) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 17) (14, 9) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 10) (16, 1) (16, 6) (2, 4) (2, 19) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 6) (17, 3) (17, 18) (17, 0) (1, 9) (1, 16) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are many cycles in this graph, but we are only interested in cycles of length 4 or more. Below are some of the cycles in the graph:
1. (5, 19, 2, 4)
2. (9, 10, 18, 5)
3. (3, 15, 0, 17)
4. (4, 8, 0, 15)
5. (8, 4, 12, 2)
6. (15, 7, 13, 6)
7. (10, 3, 17, 0)
8. (19, 11, 8, 4)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. (5, 19, 2, 4) - Chord: (5, 2)
2. (9, 10, 18, 5) - Chord: (9, 18)
3. (19, 11, 8, 4) - Chord: (19, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <5, 19, 2, 4> (Chord: (5, 2))
2. <9, 10, 18, 5> (Chord: (9, 18))
3. <19, 11, 8, 4> (Chord: (19, 8))
