Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 12) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 5-9-10-1-5

- Cycle 6: 5-12-6-11-5
- Cycle 7: 9-10-2-12-9
- Cycle 8: 9-10-1-7-9
- Cycle 9: 9-0-7-11-9
- Cycle 10: 9-0-8-14-9
- Cycle 11: 6-3-4-11-6
- Cycle 12: 6-12-2-0-6
- Cycle 13: 4-3-12-2-4
- Cycle 14: 4-8-14-2-4
- Cycle 15: 4-11-7-1-4
- Cycle 16: 8-14-13-3-8
- Cycle 17: 8-0-2-12-8
- Cycle 18: 8-0-7-1-8
- Cycle 19: 0-7-11-13-0
- Cycle 20: 7-11-13-14-7
- Cycle 21: 7-1-10-9-7
- Cycle 22: 1-10-12-6-1
- Cycle 23: 2-0-9-10-2
- Cycle 24: 2-12-6-3-2
- Cycle 25: 2-14-13-11-2
- Cycle 26: 12-2-14-13-12
- Cycle 27: 12-5-4-11-12
- Cycle 28: 12-6-3-4-12
- Cycle 29: 3-4-8-0-3
- Cycle 30: 3-6-12-5-3
- Cycle 31: 3-13-11-7-3
- Cycle 32: 11-7-1-10-11
- Cycle 33: 11-6-12-2-11
- Cycle 34: 11-4-3-13-11
- Cycle 35: 14-8-0-7-14
- Cycle 36: 14-1-10-9-14
- Cycle 37: 14-13-11-7-14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <5, 9, 10, 1> has a chord (10, 1)
- <5, 8, 0, 7> has a chord (0, 7)
- <9, 0, 7, 11> has a chord (7, 11)
- <6, 3, 4, 11> has a chord (4, 11)
- <6, 12, 2, 0> has a chord (2, 0)
- <4, 3, 12, 2> has a chord (12, 2)
- <8, 0, 2, 12> has a chord (2, 12)
- <7, 1, 10, 9> has a chord (10, 9)
- <13, 3, 11, 7> has a chord (11, 7)
- <14, 8, 0, 7> has a chord (8, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [10].
