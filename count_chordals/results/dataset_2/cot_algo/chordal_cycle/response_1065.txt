Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 25) (15, 16) (27, 7) (27, 1) (6, 7) (6, 29) (6, 0) (9, 0) (22, 2) (23, 8) (23, 0) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 17) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 21) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 29) (14, 4) (14, 0) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 10) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 21) (26, 7) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 28) (17, 8) (17, 20) (17, 12) (17, 5) (20, 17) (20, 24) (20, 28) (20, 10) (21, 4) (21, 26) (21, 16) (28, 26) (28, 11) (28, 20) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 21) (16, 1) (10, 13) (10, 26) (10, 20) (10, 7) (10, 24) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 12) (24, 20) (24, 10) (24, 7) (24, 25) (7, 27) (7, 6) (7, 26) (7, 10) (7, 24) (29, 6) (29, 0) (29, 13) (19, 1) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 25) (1, 27) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 19) (25, 15) (25, 24) (25, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
1. Cycle <0, 6, 29, 13> with chords (0, 29) and (6, 13)
2. Cycle <3, 2, 22, 5> with chords (3, 22) and (2, 5)
3. Cycle <4, 21, 26, 7> with chords (4, 26) and (21, 7)
4. Cycle <10, 24, 7, 26> with chords (10, 7) and (24, 26)
5. Cycle <12, 17, 5, 8> with chords (12, 5) and (17, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the listed cycles, we can see that only cycle <3, 2, 22, 5> with chords (3, 22) and (2, 5) has exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
