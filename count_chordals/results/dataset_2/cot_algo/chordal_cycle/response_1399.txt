Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-13-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-8-14-11-5
- Cycle 3: 5-8-7-2-5
- Cycle 4: 9-13-7-11-9
- Cycle 5: 9-13-8-4-9
- Cycle 6: 9-13-1-10-9
- Cycle 7: 1-3-0-9-1
- Cycle 8: 1-3-4-8-1
- Cycle 9: 1-3-0-9-13-1
- Cycle 10: 8-4-1-3-8
- Cycle 11: 8-4-10-6-8
- Cycle 12: 8-4-1-10-8
- Cycle 13: 8-4-3-1-8
- Cycle 14: 13-9-11-7-13
- Cycle 15: 13-9-0-3-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, (3, 8), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
