Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (18, 10) (18, 13) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (19, 13) (2, 1) (2, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 17) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (14, 15) (14, 7) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 2) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
Following the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <3, 15, 14, 7> with chords (3, 7)
- Cycle 2: <4, 7, 14, 15> with chords (4, 14)
- Cycle 3: <10, 11, 6, 17> with chords (10, 6)
- Cycle 4: <17, 6, 11, 5> with chords (17, 11)
- Cycle 5: <13, 15, 14, 7> with chords (13, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord, so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord, so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord, so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord, so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord, so it is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
As all cycles have at least one chord, the count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
