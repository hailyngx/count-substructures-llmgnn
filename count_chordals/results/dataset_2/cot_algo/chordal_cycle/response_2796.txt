Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more:  
- Cycle 1: 5-6-9-0-5  
- Cycle 2: 5-7-4-0-5  
- Cycle 3: 5-8-9-0-5  
- Cycle 4: 5-1-0-4-5  
- Cycle 5: 6-7-4-0-6  
- Cycle 6: 6-3-0-9-6  
- Cycle 7: 9-8-5-1-9  
- Cycle 8: 9-0-4-3-9  

Step 2:  
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:  
- Cycle 1: 5-6-9-0-5 (Chord: 6-9)  
- Cycle 2: 5-7-4-0-5 (Chord: 7-4)  
- Cycle 3: 5-8-9-0-5 (Chord: 8-9)  
- Cycle 4: 5-1-0-4-5 (Chord: 1-4)  
- Cycle 5: 6-7-4-0-6 (Chord: 6-4)  
- Cycle 6: 6-3-0-9-6 (Chord: 6-9)  
- Cycle 7: 9-8-5-1-9 (Chord: 9-5)  
- Cycle 8: 9-0-4-3-9 (Chord: 9-4)  

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:  
<1, (6-9), 5>  
<2, (7-4), 5>  
<3, (8-9), 5>  
<4, (1-4), 5>  
<5, (6-4), 7>  
<6, (6-9), 0>  
<7, (9-5), 1>  
<8, (9-4), 0>
