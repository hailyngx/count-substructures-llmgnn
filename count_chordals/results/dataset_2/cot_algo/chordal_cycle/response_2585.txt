Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 7, 3)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 7, 6)
- Cycle 5: (5, 0, 6, 2)
- Cycle 6: (9, 3, 7, 4)
- Cycle 7: (9, 3, 1, 8)
- Cycle 8: (9, 7, 4, 8)
- Cycle 9: (4, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 10: (4, 7, 6, 2)
- Cycle 11: (4, 8, 1, 3)
- Cycle 12: (7, 3, 1, 8)
- Cycle 13: (7, 3, 9, 5)
- Cycle 14: (7, 4, 8, 1)
- Cycle 15: (7, 6, 2, 0)
- Cycle 16: (1, 3, 7, 4)
- Cycle 17: (1, 3, 9, 5)
- Cycle 18: (1, 8, 4, 7)
- Cycle 19: (3, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 20: (3, 9, 5, 2)
- Cycle 21: (3, 7, 4, 8)
- Cycle 22: (3, 1, 8, 4)
- Cycle 23: (6, 4, 7, 3)
- Cycle 24: (6, 4, 8, 1)
- Cycle 25: (6, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 26: (6, 2, 0, 5)
- Cycle 27: (8, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 28: (8, 1, 4, 7)
- Cycle 29: (8, 3, 7, 4)
- Cycle 30: (8, 4, 7, 6)
- Cycle 31: (2, 5, 9, 3)
- Cycle 32: (2, 5, 9, 7)
- Cycle 33: (2, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 34: (2, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 35: (2, 6, 4, 7)
- Cycle 36: (2, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle 37: (2, 0, 5, 9)
- Cycle 38: (2, 0, 6, 4)
- Cycle 39: (0, 5, 9, 7)
- Cycle 40: (0, 5, 4, 7)
- Cycle 41: (0, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle 42: (0, 6, 4, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

There are several chordal 4-cycles found.
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 1), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (5, 9), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, (9, 7), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (6, 4), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (5, 7), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 37 chordless cycles found.

Final answer: [37]
