Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 16) (9, 19) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 17) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 7) (17, 14) (17, 10) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 16) (8, 10) (8, 11) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 13) (0, 5) (0, 13) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 1) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 18) (15, 1) (15, 16) (15, 12) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 12) (6, 10) (6, 3) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 19) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 12) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (7, 10, 17, 14, 7)
- (7, 10, 6, 3, 7)
- (4, 18, 15, 1, 4)
- (4, 19, 12, 16, 4)
- (4, 19, 7, 11, 4)
- (16, 14, 17, 10, 16)
- (16, 15, 18, 4, 16)
- (16, 9, 19, 12, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (15, 18), 4, (1, 13)>
- <4, (18, 13), 19, (4, 2)>
- <7, (10, 6), 3, (7, 14)>
- <16, (14, 17), 10, (16, 15)>
- <16, (9, 12), 19, (16, 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [5].
