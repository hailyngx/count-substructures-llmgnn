Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 18) (16, 12) (9, 5) (9, 3) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 21) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 28) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 25) (20, 4) (20, 6) (17, 3) (17, 23) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 8) (21, 26) (21, 28) (28, 5) (28, 29) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 19) (1, 26) (1, 24) (1, 27) (22, 11) (22, 26) (22, 12) (22, 25) (6, 20) (6, 24) (6, 23) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 29) (7, 0) (7, 19) (23, 11) (23, 17) (23, 6) (23, 13) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 27) (27, 1) (27, 25) (27, 2) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (24, 1) (24, 6) (24, 19) (8, 15) (8, 29) (8, 28) (8, 3) (12, 16) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 18) (2, 5) (2, 27) (19, 28) (19, 7) (19, 24) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 18) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 14) (4, 20) (4, 0) (13, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-3-17-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-3-10-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-3-8-5
- Cycle 4: 5-2-27-1-5
- Cycle 5: 5-2-27-25-5
- Cycle 6: 5-2-27-1-26-22-5
- Cycle 7: 5-2-27-25-22-5
- Cycle 8: 5-0-4-20-6-5
- Cycle 9: 5-0-4-20-6-24-1-5
- Cycle 10: 5-0-7-29-28-21-5
- Cycle 11: 5-28-8-15-18-5
- Cycle 12: 5-28-8-3-17-5
- Cycle 13: 5-28-8-3-9-5
- Cycle 14: 5-28-21-26-1-5
- Cycle 15: 5-28-21-26-22-5
- Cycle 16: 5-28-19-24-1-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, (9, 3), 17, 5>
- <5, (9, 3), 10, 5>
- <5, (9, 3), 8, 5>
- <5, 2, (27, 25), 5>
- No chord found
- <5, 2, (27, 1), 26, 22, 5>
- <5, 2, 27, (25, 22), 5>
- No chord found
- No chord found
- <5, (0, 7), 29, 28, 21, 5>
- <5, 28, (8, 15), 18, 5>
- <5, 28, (8, 3), 17, 5>
- <5, 28, (8, 3), 9, 5>
- <5, 28, 21, 26, 1, 5>
- <5, 28, 21, 26, 22, 5>
- No chord found

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
