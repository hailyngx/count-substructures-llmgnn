Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 3, 7, 5)
- (9, 6, 1, 9)
- (9, 4, 7, 9)
- (9, 7, 1, 9)
- (4, 9, 6, 4)
- (4, 7, 1, 4)
- (7, 5, 3, 7)
- (7, 9, 6, 7)
- (7, 4, 9, 7)
- (7, 1, 6, 7)
- (1, 6, 9, 1)
- (1, 7, 4, 1)
- (3, 5, 7, 3)
- (3, 9, 7, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, 3, 7, 5> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <9, 6, 1, 9> (Chord: (6, 1))
- <9, 4, 7, 9> (Chord: (9, 4))
- <4, 7, 1, 4> (Chord: (7, 1))
- <7, 5, 3, 7> (Chord: (5, 3))
- <7, 9, 6, 7> (Chord: (9, 6))
- <7, 4, 9, 7> (Chord: (4, 9))
- <7, 1, 6, 7> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <3, 5, 7, 3> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <3, 9, 7, 3> (Chord: (9, 7))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [9].
