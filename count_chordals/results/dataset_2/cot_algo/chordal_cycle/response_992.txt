Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 4: 3-10-12-4-3
- Cycle 5: 3-10-14-2-3
- Cycle 6: 3-13-12-4-3
- Cycle 7: 3-13-12-1-3
- Cycle 8: 0-1-10-11-0
- Cycle 9: 0-6-7-2-0
- Cycle 10: 0-6-1-10-0
- Cycle 11: 0-6-1-12-0
- Cycle 12: 0-6-1-9-0
- Cycle 13: 0-11-10-1-0
- Cycle 14: 0-11-9-3-0
- Cycle 15: 0-12-4-14-0
- Cycle 16: 0-12-10-1-0
- Cycle 17: 0-12-9-11-0
- Cycle 18: 1-10-11-0-1
- Cycle 19: 1-10-12-4-1
- Cycle 20: 1-10-3-7-1
- Cycle 21: 1-10-3-9-1
- Cycle 22: 1-12-4-14-1
- Cycle 23: 1-12-9-11-1
- Cycle 24: 1-6-7-2-1
- Cycle 25: 1-6-5-3-1
- Cycle 26: 2-4-12-13-2
- Cycle 27: 2-4-3-7-2
- Cycle 28: 2-7-6-8-2
- Cycle 29: 4-12-13-3-4
- Cycle 30: 4-14-10-12-4
- Cycle 31: 4-14-2-7-4
- Cycle 32: 5-3-7-6-5
- Cycle 33: 5-6-1-10-5
- Cycle 34: 5-6-7-3-5
- Cycle 35: 6-7-2-14-6
- Cycle 36: 6-8-2-7-6
- Cycle 37: 7-3-10-14-7
- Cycle 38: 7-6-1-12-7
- Cycle 39: 9-11-10-1-9
- Cycle 40: 9-11-12-4-9
- Cycle 41: 9-12-4-14-9
- Cycle 42: 9-12-10-3-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (10, 12), 3, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (12, 10), 3, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, (7, 2), 3, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (11, 10), 1, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (12, 4), 10, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [5] chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.
