Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 12, 7) with edges (5, 9), (9, 12), (12, 7), (7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 12, 7, 13) with edges (4, 12), (12, 7), (7, 13), (13, 4)
- Cycle 3: (8, 4, 12, 7) with edges (8, 4), (4, 12), (12, 7), (7, 8)
- Cycle 4: (10, 13, 7, 12) with edges (10, 13), (13, 7), (7, 12), (12, 10)
- Cycle 5: (6, 8, 4, 13) with edges (6, 8), (8, 4), (4, 13), (13, 6)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (12, 4)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (13, 7)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (8, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0 as all cycles have chords.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
