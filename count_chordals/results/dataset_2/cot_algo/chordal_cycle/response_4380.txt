Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-7-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-0-6
- Cycle 3: 6-9-8-6
- Cycle 4: 6-9-5-6
- Cycle 5: 2-6-9-7-2
- Cycle 6: 2-6-9-0-2
- Cycle 7: 2-6-9-8-2
- Cycle 8: 2-6-9-5-2
- Cycle 9: 1-6-9-7-1
- Cycle 10: 1-6-9-0-1
- Cycle 11: 1-6-9-8-1
- Cycle 12: 1-6-9-5-1
- Cycle 13: 3-6-9-7-3
- Cycle 14: 3-6-9-0-3
- Cycle 15: 3-6-9-8-3
- Cycle 16: 3-6-9-5-3
- Cycle 17: 4-8-9-7-4
- Cycle 18: 4-8-9-0-4
- Cycle 19: 4-8-9-6-4
- Cycle 20: 4-8-9-5-4

Step 2:  
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <6, 9, 7, 6> has 1 chord: (6, 7)
- <6, 9, 0, 6> has 1 chord: (6, 0)
- <6, 9, 8, 6> has 1 chord: (6, 8)
- <6, 9, 5, 6> has 1 chord: (6, 5)
- <2, 6, 9, 7, 2> has 1 chord: (6, 7)
- <2, 6, 9, 0, 2> has 1 chord: (6, 0)
- <2, 6, 9, 8, 2> has 1 chord: (6, 8)
- <2, 6, 9, 5, 2> has 1 chord: (6, 5)
- <1, 6, 9, 7, 1> has 1 chord: (6, 7)
- <1, 6, 9, 0, 1> has 1 chord: (6, 0)
- <1, 6, 9, 8, 1> has 1 chord: (6, 8)
- <1, 6, 9, 5, 1> has 1 chord: (6, 5)
- <3, 6, 9, 7, 3> has 1 chord: (6, 7)
- <3, 6, 9, 0, 3> has 1 chord: (6, 0)
- <3, 6, 9, 8, 3> has 1 chord: (6, 8)
- <3, 6, 9, 5, 3> has 1 chord: (6, 5)
- <4, 8, 9, 7, 4> has 1 chord: (8, 7)
- <4, 8, 9, 0, 4> has 1 chord: (8, 0)
- <4, 8, 9, 6, 4> has 1 chord: (6, 8)
- <4, 8, 9, 5, 4> has 1 chord: (8, 5)

Step 3:  
Count the number of chordless cycles: 20

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [20].
