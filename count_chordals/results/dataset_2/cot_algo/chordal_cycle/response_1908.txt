Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 6) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
1. Cycle: 1-3-4-9-2-12-6 (length 6)
2. Cycle: 1-3-4-12-10-0 (length 5)
3. Cycle: 1-3-5-11-12-10-0 (length 6)
4. Cycle: 1-3-11-12-10-0 (length 5)
5. Cycle: 1-7-3-5-4-9-2-12-6 (length 8)
6. Cycle: 1-7-3-11-12-10-0 (length 6)
7. Cycle: 1-7-3-4-9-2-12-6 (length 8)
8. Cycle: 1-7-3-5-11-12-10-0 (length 8)
9. Cycle: 1-7-3-11-12-10-0 (length 7)
10. Cycle: 1-11-3-5-4-9-2-12-6 (length 8)
11. Cycle: 1-11-3-4-12-10-0 (length 7)
12. Cycle: 1-11-5-3-7-13-10-0 (length 7)
13. Cycle: 3-1-7-13-0-4-12-10 (length 7)
14. Cycle: 3-4-12-10-0-13-14-6 (length 7)
15. Cycle: 5-3-7-13-10-0-4-9 (length 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Only the cycle 1-3-4-9-2-12-6 has exactly one chord: (1, 6).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1].

List of chordal 4-cycle:
<1, (1, 6), 3, 4, 9>
