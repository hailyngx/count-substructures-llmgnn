Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  

There are several cycles in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-2-6-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-1-6-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-1-6-0
- Cycle 4: 0-5-6-1-0
- Cycle 5: 0-6-9-7-0
- Cycle 6: 0-7-9-4-0
- Cycle 7: 1-0-3-2-1
- Cycle 8: 1-0-4-9-1
- Cycle 9: 1-3-2-7-1
- Cycle 10: 1-4-9-7-1
- Cycle 11: 2-0-6-1-2
- Cycle 12: 2-3-1-6-2
- Cycle 13: 2-7-9-4-2
- Cycle 14: 3-0-6-1-3
- Cycle 15: 4-0-1-3-4
- Cycle 16: 4-0-7-9-4
- Cycle 17: 4-1-3-2-4
- Cycle 18: 4-7-9-6-4
- Cycle 19: 5-0-6-1-5
- Cycle 20: 6-1-3-0-6
- Cycle 21: 6-2-7-9-6
- Cycle 22: 7-0-1-4-7
- Cycle 23: 7-2-3-1-7
- Cycle 24: 8-4-9-7-8
- Cycle 25: 9-4-0-6-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).  

Among the listed cycles, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- Cycle 19: 5-0-6-1-5, Chord: (0, 1)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  

There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found: <5, (0, 1), 6>  

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
