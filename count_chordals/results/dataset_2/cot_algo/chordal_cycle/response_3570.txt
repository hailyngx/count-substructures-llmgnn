Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 9 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 3: 0 - 5 - 4 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 4: 2 - 6 - 1 - 8 - 2
- Cycle 5: 3 - 9 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 6: 1 - 4 - 2 - 6 - 1

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord 9-1
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord 4-7
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord 5-2
- Cycle 4 has no chords
- Cycle 5 has no chords
- Cycle 6 has no chords

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have: [3]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <5, 9, 1, 6>
2. <5, 4, 9, 7>
3. <0, 5, 4, 2>
