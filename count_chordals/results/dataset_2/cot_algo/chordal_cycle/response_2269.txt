Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 10) (9, 23) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 11) (26, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 19) (3, 22) (25, 8) (25, 21) (25, 22) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 27) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 2) (8, 26) (8, 25) (8, 24) (8, 21) (15, 1) (20, 17) (0, 14) (0, 21) (19, 26) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 28) (22, 3) (22, 25) (22, 6) (22, 28) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 29) (13, 28) (11, 26) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 2) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 24) (28, 19) (28, 22) (28, 13) (28, 18) (24, 8) (24, 23) (24, 18) (21, 25) (21, 8) (21, 0) (21, 12) (12, 21) (6, 7) (6, 22) (29, 26) (29, 13) (29, 16) (29, 18) (29, 10) (18, 5) (18, 28) (18, 24) (18, 29) (10, 9) (10, 29) (10, 27) (16, 13) (16, 29) (16, 27) (27, 14) (27, 10) (27, 16) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 11, 4, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 19, 26, 11, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 19, 5, 7, 6, 22, 3, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 19, 5, 18, 28, 13, 2, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 19, 5, 7, 6, 22, 25, 8, 26, 11, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 15, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 4, 11, 26, 19, 1, 15, 1, 3, 22, 25, 8, 21, 0, 14, 17, 20, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <1, 11, 4, 2, 1>
- <1, 19, 26, 11, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
