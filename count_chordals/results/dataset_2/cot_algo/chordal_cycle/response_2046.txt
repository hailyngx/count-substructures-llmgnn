Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 24) (0, 28) (0, 5) (0, 19) (27, 3) (27, 25) (27, 14) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 10) (22, 23) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 28) (20, 6) (20, 9) (20, 25) (25, 27) (25, 22) (25, 20) (25, 29) (25, 24) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 8) (7, 12) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 21) (21, 5) (21, 16) (21, 24) (8, 18) (8, 24) (8, 29) (8, 16) (16, 12) (16, 21) (16, 8) (16, 2) (19, 0) (19, 4) (19, 10) (11, 18) (11, 26) (11, 17) (2, 16) (2, 26) (2, 1) (26, 7) (26, 11) (26, 2) (26, 17) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (28, 0) (28, 23) (24, 15) (24, 25) (24, 21) (24, 8) (4, 19) (4, 17) (29, 25) (29, 8) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 1) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 18) (14, 1) (17, 23) (17, 11) (17, 26) (17, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-15-6-9-3
- Cycle 2: 3-15-24-25-27-3
- Cycle 3: 3-5-0-28-23-27-14-3
- Cycle 4: 3-27-14-18-11-26-17-23-3
- Cycle 5: 15-6-20-25-27-14-15
- Cycle 6: 15-24-21-5-0-19-10-9-15
- Cycle 7: 15-24-8-16-12-7-26-17-15
- Cycle 8: 15-24-21-16-2-26-17-23-15
- Cycle 9: 15-6-20-25-29-8-18-14-15

Step 2:
Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Only the Cycle 3 has exactly one chord (5-28) and is chordal.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Chordal 4-cycle found:
- <3, (5, 28), 0, 19>
