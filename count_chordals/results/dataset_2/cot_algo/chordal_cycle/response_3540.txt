Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 11) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 0, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 6, 0, 3, 9)
- Cycle 3: (6, 8, 12, 7, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 0, 12, 8, 6)
- Cycle 5: (8, 12, 0, 3, 8)
- Cycle 6: (8, 13, 4, 2, 8)
- Cycle 7: (13, 4, 2, 7, 13)
- Cycle 8: (4, 9, 6, 0, 4)
- Cycle 9: (7, 5, 9, 6, 7)
- Cycle 10: (7, 0, 12, 11, 7)
- Cycle 11: (0, 6, 9, 4, 0)
- Cycle 12: (0, 10, 14, 2, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1 <5, (6, 0), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2 <9, (6, 0), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3 <6, (8, 12), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4 <6, (8, 12), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5 <8, (0, 12), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6 <8, (13, 4), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7 <13, (4, 2), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8 <4, (9, 6), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9 <7, (9, 6), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10 <7, (12, 11), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11 <0, (6, 9), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
- Therefore, the final number of chordless cycles is [11].
