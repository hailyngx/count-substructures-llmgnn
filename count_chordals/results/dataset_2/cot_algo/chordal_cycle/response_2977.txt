Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (5, 7) (5, 10) (1, 11) (1, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (6, 2, 8, 7) with chord (2, 7) 
        - Cycle 2: (6, 2, 10, 9) with chord (2, 9) 
        - Cycle 3: (6, 2, 3, 0) with chord (2, 0) 
        - Cycle 4: (6, 9, 10, 13) with chord (9, 13)
        - Cycle 5: (6, 9, 4, 14) with chord (9, 14)
        - Cycle 6: (6, 0, 3, 14) with chord (0, 14)
        - Cycle 7: (6, 13, 14, 4) with chord (13, 4)
        - Cycle 8: (9, 7, 8, 11) with chord (7, 11)
        - Cycle 9: (9, 7, 3, 6) with chord (7, 6)
        - Cycle 10: (9, 4, 1, 11) with chord (4, 11)
        - Cycle 11: (2, 8, 11, 1) with chord (8, 1)
        - Cycle 12: (2, 10, 5, 7) with chord (10, 7)
        - Cycle 13: (2, 3, 0, 14) with chord (3, 14)
        - Cycle 14: (8, 11, 1, 4) with chord (11, 4)
        - Cycle 15: (0, 3, 13, 14) with chord (3, 14)
        - Cycle 16: (7, 3, 13, 4) with chord (3, 4)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Found 11 chordal cycles:
          <6, 2, 10, 9> with chord (2, 9)
          <6, 2, 3, 0> with chord (2, 0)
          <6, 9, 10, 13> with chord (9, 13)
          <6, 9, 4, 14> with chord (9, 14)
          <6, 0, 3, 14> with chord (0, 14)
          <6, 13, 14, 4> with chord (13, 4)
          <9, 7, 8, 11> with chord (7, 11)
          <9, 7, 3, 6> with chord (7, 6)
          <9, 4, 1, 11> with chord (4, 11)
          <2, 8, 11, 1> with chord (8, 1)
          <0, 3, 13, 14> with chord (3, 14)

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles found:
