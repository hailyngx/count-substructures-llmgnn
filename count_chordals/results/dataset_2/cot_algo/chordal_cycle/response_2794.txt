Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

       - Cycle 1: <0, 1, 2, 6>
       - Cycle 2: <1, 2, 6, 7>
       - Cycle 3: <1, 4, 3, 0>
       - Cycle 4: <1, 4, 8, 9>
       - Cycle 5: <1, 6, 7, 0>
       - Cycle 6: <2, 6, 7, 0>
       - Cycle 7: <3, 4, 1, 6>
       - Cycle 8: <3, 4, 8, 7>
       - Cycle 9: <3, 0, 7, 6>
       - Cycle 10: <4, 8, 7, 6>
       - Cycle 11: <5, 6, 1, 0>
       - Cycle 12: <5, 7, 0, 3>
       - Cycle 13: <6, 7, 8, 4>
       - Cycle 14: <8, 4, 1, 9>
       - Cycle 15: <8, 4, 3, 0>
       - Cycle 16: <8, 7, 6, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

       - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 1, (2, 6), 7>
       - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 4, (8, 9), 3>
       - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 6, (7, 0), 2>
       - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 4, (1, 6), 8>
       - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, 0, (7, 6), 4>
       - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, 8, (7, 6), 1>
       - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, 7, (0, 3), 6>
       - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, 7, (8, 4), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
