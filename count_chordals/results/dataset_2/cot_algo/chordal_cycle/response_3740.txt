Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (15, 10) (15, 14) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 14) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 1) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 0) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 1) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 1) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 17) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 7) (14, 15) (14, 16) (14, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
  - Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 8 - 3 - 5
  - Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 7 - 1 - 5
  - Cycle 3: 5 - 6 - 10 - 15 - 5
  - Cycle 4: 10 - 15 - 14 - 4 - 10
  - Cycle 5: 4 - 14 - 16 - 3 - 4
  - Cycle 6: 4 - 12 - 10 - 6 - 4
  - Cycle 7: 12 - 4 - 11 - 0 - 12
  - Cycle 8: 0 - 4 - 19 - 1 - 0
  - Cycle 9: 19 - 1 - 13 - 18 - 19
  - Cycle 10: 18 - 16 - 14 - 5 - 18
  - Cycle 11: 13 - 18 - 16 - 14 - 13
  - Cycle 12: 17 - 13 - 1 - 7 - 17

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
  - Cycle 5 has a chord: <5, (3, 16), 4>
  - Cycle 6 has a chord: <6, (5, 15), 10>
  - Cycle 7 has a chord: <4, (0, 11), 12>
  - Cycle 8 has a chord: <0, (1, 19), 4>
  - Cycle 9 has a chord: <19, (1, 13), 18>
  - Cycle 10 has a chord: <18, (14, 5), 16>
  - Cycle 12 has a chord: <17, (1, 7), 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
  - There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
