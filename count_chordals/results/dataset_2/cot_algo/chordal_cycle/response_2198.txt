Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 1 - 4 - 6
  Chords: (4, 14)

- Cycle 2: 6 - 4 - 7 - 6
  Chords: (1, 14)

- Cycle 3: 6 - 4 - 7 - 2 - 6
  Chords: (14, 5)

- Cycle 4: 6 - 8 - 1 - 6
  Chords: (4, 13)

- Cycle 5: 6 - 8 - 1 - 13 - 6
  Chords: (4, 0)

- Cycle 6: 6 - 8 - 11 - 7 - 6
  Chords: (4, 12)

- Cycle 7: 6 - 8 - 11 - 2 - 6
  Chords: (4, 5)

- Cycle 8: 6 - 14 - 7 - 6
  Chords: (1, 4)

- Cycle 9: 6 - 14 - 7 - 12 - 6
  Chords: (1, 5)

- Cycle 10: 6 - 14 - 0 - 6
  Chords: (1, 13)

- Cycle 11: 9 - 2 - 7 - 4 - 9
  Chords: (10, 1)

- Cycle 12: 9 - 2 - 14 - 6 - 9
  Chords: (10, 5)

- Cycle 13: 9 - 0 - 13 - 1 - 9
  Chords: (2, 8)

- Cycle 14: 9 - 0 - 14 - 6 - 9
  Chords: (2, 4)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (4, 14), 1, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (1, 14), 4, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (14, 5), 4, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (4, 13), 8, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (4, 0), 8, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (4, 12), 8, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (4, 5), 8, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (1, 4), 14, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (1, 5), 14, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (1, 13), 14, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (10, 1), 2, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (10, 5), 2, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (2, 8), 0, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (2, 4), 0, 14>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [14].
