Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 6) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (1, 9, 14, 13, 8, 1)
        - Cycle 2: (3, 12, 4, 11, 3)
        - Cycle 3: (1, 9, 7, 0, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (8, 1, 3, 11, 8)
        - Cycle 5: (9, 1, 3, 5, 9)
        - Cycle 6: (13, 5, 3, 11, 13)
        - Cycle 7: (2, 13, 6, 8, 2)
        - Cycle 8: (4, 6, 13, 2, 4)
        - Cycle 9: (12, 4, 11, 8, 12)
        - Cycle 10: (10, 4, 12, 9, 10)
        - Cycle 11: (7, 0, 1, 8, 7)
        - Cycle 12: (14, 13, 6, 4, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 5), 9, 13>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, (8, 12), 4, 11>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (7, 9), 0, 1>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, (1, 11), 3, 8>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (1, 3), 5, 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <13, (11, 5), 3, 13>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <2, (6, 8), 13, 2>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, (12, 6), 13, 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <12, (4, 8), 11, 12>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (4, 12), 9, 10>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <7, (0, 1), 8, 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <14, (6, 13), 4, 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = [0]
