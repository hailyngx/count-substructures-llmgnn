Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 4 - 9 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 1 - 2 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 3 - 6 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 4: 1 - 2 - 5 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 4 - 9 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 6: 2 - 4 - 9 - 5 - 2
- Cycle 7: 3 - 6 - 9 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 8: 3 - 6 - 8 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 9: 4 - 9 - 5 - 2 - 4
- Cycle 10: 5 - 7 - 8 - 6 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (4-5), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (1-2), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 has no chords, so it is chordless.
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord (2-9), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord (4-5), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 6 has no chords, so it is chordless.
- Cycle 7 has no chords, so it is chordless.
- Cycle 8 has no chords, so it is chordless.
- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord (2-5), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 10 has no chords, so it is chordless.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, (1, 4), 9, 5>
- <0, (1, 2), 5, 1>
- <1, (2, 9), 5, 9>
- <4, (2, 5), 9, 5>
