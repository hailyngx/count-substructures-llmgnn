Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 13) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 12) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (13, 0) (13, 5) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (9, 18) (9, 8) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 1) (14, 3) (15, 12) (15, 16) (19, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 12) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 19) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (16, 18) (16, 15) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 0-2-6-19-0
- Cycle 2: 0-19-7-11-1-8-9-18-4-3-14-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-12-18-4-3-14-1-0
- Cycle 4: 0-13-5-17-7-11-1-14-3-4-18-12-19-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- Cycle 1: <0, 2, 6, 19> (Chord: (0, 6))
- Cycle 2: <0, 19, 7, 11> (Chord: (7, 11))
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 12, 18> (Chord: (5, 12))
- Cycle 4: <0, 13, 5, 17> (Chord: (5, 17))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Final answer: [4]
