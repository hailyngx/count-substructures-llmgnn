Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 5) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 4) (9, 2) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 18) (3, 8) (11, 17) (11, 8) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 14) (15, 0) (15, 5) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (16, 6) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- <1, 6, 13, 14, 1>
- <1, 10, 14, 1>
- <1, 14, 10, 1>
- <1, 14, 13, 6, 1>
- <2, 4, 9, 2>
- <2, 9, 4, 2>
- <5, 7, 4, 2, 5>
- <5, 8, 2, 4, 5>
- <5, 14, 13, 6, 5>
- <6, 1, 10, 14, 6>
- <6, 13, 14, 10, 6>
- <8, 2, 4, 9, 8>
- <12, 2, 4, 9, 12>
- <12, 17, 10, 14, 12>
- <13, 6, 1, 10, 13>
- <13, 14, 1, 6, 13>
- <14, 1, 6, 13, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, 6, 13, 14, 1> (Chord: 6, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord in the given graph is [1].
