Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 4) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 19) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 5) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 5) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 19) (0, 9) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 14) (9, 0) (9, 14) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 1) (13, 7) (13, 16) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 9) (16, 4) (16, 13) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 15) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 8) (6, 17) (6, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 1-8-5-10-1
        - Cycle 2: 1-8-3-12-6-17-1
        - Cycle 3: 1-4-11-18-14-9-0-1
        - Cycle 4: 1-4-16-13-7-0-11-1
        - Cycle 5: 1-4-16-13-7-0-19-15-1
      
Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        <1, (8, 5), 10>
        <1, (8, 3), 12>
        <1, (4, 11), 18>
        <1, (4, 16), 13>
        <1, (4, 16), 7, 0, 19, 15>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
