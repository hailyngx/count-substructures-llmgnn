Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 13) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 2) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-1-3-4
- Cycle 2: 4-7-12-13-4
- Cycle 3: 4-10-11-9-4
- Cycle 4: 4-14-2-7-4
- Cycle 5: 4-6-1-7-4
- Cycle 6: 4-8-3-9-4
- Cycle 7: 7-1-3-5-7
- Cycle 8: 7-12-13-0-7
- Cycle 9: 7-14-2-0-7
- Cycle 10: 7-1-6-10-7
- Cycle 11: 1-3-9-11-1
- Cycle 12: 3-8-14-2-3
- Cycle 13: 3-9-13-0-3
- Cycle 14: 10-11-5-13-10
- Cycle 15: 10-6-1-7-10
- Cycle 16: 10-12-7-4-10
- Cycle 17: 11-5-13-9-11
- Cycle 18: 11-6-4-10-11
- Cycle 19: 8-3-1-7-8

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (unique chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <4, (7, 1), 3>
- <4, (7, 12), 13>
- <4, (10, 11), 9>
- <4, (14, 2), 7>
- <7, (1, 3), 5>
- <7, (12, 13), 0>
- <7, (14, 2), 0>
- <10, (11, 5), 13>
- <10, (6, 1), 7>
- <10, (12, 7), 4>
- <11, (5, 13), 9>
- <11, (6, 4), 10>
- <8, (3, 1), 7>

Step 3:
There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. Thus, the total number of chordless 4-cycles is [13].
