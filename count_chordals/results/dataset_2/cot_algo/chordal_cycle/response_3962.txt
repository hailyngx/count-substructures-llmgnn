Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 15) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 6) (6, 15) (6, 13) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 2) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 19) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 13) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 9) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 16) (13, 14) (13, 12) (18, 0) (5, 17) (5, 16) (11, 8) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 14) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<0, 2, 7, 16>  
<0, 2, 11, 8>  
<0, 2, 11, 9>  
<0, 2, 7, 8>  
<0, 2, 7, 9>  
<0, 2, 11, 9>  
<0, 2, 11, 8>  
<0, 18, 19, 14>  
<0, 18, 19, 17>  
<0, 19, 14, 13>  
<0, 19, 14, 9>  
<0, 19, 3, 9>  
<0, 19, 3, 4>  
<2, 0, 18, 19>  
<2, 0, 18, 19>  
<2, 7, 16, 13>  
<2, 7, 17, 19>  
<2, 7, 17, 19>  
<2, 7, 16, 13>  
<2, 11, 8, 4>  
<2, 11, 8, 7>  
<2, 11, 9, 12>  

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:  
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:

<0, 2, 7, 16>, (7, 16)  
<0, 2, 11, 8>, (2, 11)  
<0, 2, 11, 9>, (2, 11)  
<0, 2, 7, 8>, (2, 7)  
<0, 2, 7, 9>, (2, 7)  
<0, 18, 19, 14>, (18, 14)  
<0, 18, 19, 17>, (17, 18)  
<0, 19, 14, 13>, (14, 13)  
<0, 19, 14, 9>, (14, 9)  
<0, 19, 3, 9>, (3, 9)  
<0, 19, 3, 4>, (3, 4)  
<2, 0, 18, 19>, (0, 18)  
<2, 7, 16, 13>, (7, 13)  
<2, 7, 17, 19>, (7, 19)  
<2, 11, 8, 4>, (8, 4)  
<2, 11, 9, 12>, (11, 12)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:  
There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles identified.  
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [16].
