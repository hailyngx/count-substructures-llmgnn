Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 19) (6, 7) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 2) (13, 5) (13, 15) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 12) (10, 18) (10, 1) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 2) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 15) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 12) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-11-2-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-9-19-12-0
- Cycle 3: 0-9-19-4-16-0
- Cycle 4: 0-14-1-10-18-11-2-3-0
- Cycle 5: 0-14-1-12-2-3-0
- Cycle 6: 0-16-17-8-11-9-0
- Cycle 7: 0-16-1-12-19-9-0
- Cycle 8: 0-16-4-19-9-0
- Cycle 9: 0-3-7-8-11-9-0
- Cycle 10: 1-10-18-15-2-3-7-1
- Cycle 11: 4-16-1-12-19-9-4
- Cycle 12: 7-6-3-2-11-8-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (2, 3), 4>
- Cycle 2: <2, (12, 19), 14>
- Cycle 3: <4, (9, 16), 19>
- Cycle 4: <10, (2, 3), 18>
- Cycle 5: <1, (12, 14), 9>
- Cycle 6: <11, (8, 17), 16>
- Cycle 7: <12, (9, 19), 0>
- Cycle 8: <4, (19, 16), 0>
- Cycle 9: <7, (8, 11), 3>
- Cycle 10: <1, (10, 18), 2>
- Cycle 11: <3, (2, 11), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
