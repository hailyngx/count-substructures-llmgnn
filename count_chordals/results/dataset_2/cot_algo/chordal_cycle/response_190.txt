Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 4, 8, 1)  
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 2, 6, 1)  
- Cycle 3: (1, 7, 2, 6, 1)  
- Cycle 4: (3, 8, 9, 7, 3)  
- Cycle 5: (4, 8, 2, 6, 4)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (3, 8)  
- Cycle 2 has no chords.  
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 3)  
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (8, 7)  
- Cycle 5 has no chords.  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
There are two chordless cycles in the graph.  

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [2].  
The unique chordal 4-cycles are <1, 3, 4, 8> and <1, 7, 2, 6>.
