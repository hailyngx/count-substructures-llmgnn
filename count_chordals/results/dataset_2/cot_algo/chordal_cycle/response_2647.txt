Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 6-5-3-6 has chord (5, 3) 
- Cycle 2: 6-3-9-6 has chord (3, 9) 
- Cycle 6: 6-3-1-7-6 has chord (3, 7) 
- Cycle 7: 6-5-8-2-6 has chord (5, 2) 
- Cycle 9: 6-3-5-8-6 has chord (3, 8) 
- Cycle 31: 5-3-1-7-5 has chord (3, 7) 

Step 3:
Chordless cycles found:
- Cycle 4: <6, 9, 4, 1> 
- Cycle 5: <6, 0, 2, 9> 
- Cycle 10: <6, 8, 2, 9> 
- Cycle 11: <6, 8, 7, 0> 
- Cycle 12: <9, 3, 4, 0> 
- Cycle 13: <9, 6, 5, 3> 
- Cycle 14: <9, 2, 0, 6> 
- Cycle 15: <9, 4, 1, 3> 
- Cycle 16: <1, 4, 9, 6> 
- Cycle 17: <1, 3, 5, 6> 
- Cycle 18: <1, 8, 7, 6> 
- Cycle 19: <3, 1, 4, 9> 
- Cycle 22: <3, 5, 8, 2> 
- Cycle 23: <3, 4, 9, 1> 
- Cycle 24: <4, 9, 6, 0> 
- Cycle 25: <4, 1, 3, 9> 
- Cycle 26: <4, 0, 6, 9> 
- Cycle 27: <7, 1, 4, 9> 
- Cycle 29: <7, 8, 5, 6> 
- Cycle 30: <5, 6, 3, 9> 
- Cycle 33: <2, 9, 4, 1> 
- Cycle 34: <2, 8, 6, 0> 
- Cycle 35: <2, 0, 6, 9> 
- Cycle 36: <8, 6, 0, 2> 
- Cycle 37: <8, 1, 4, 9> 
- Cycle 38: <8, 7, 1, 3> 
- Cycle 39: <8, 5, 6, 3> 

So the number of chordal 4-cycles is [25].
