Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 13) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-8-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-7-8-4-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-14-2-1-5
- Cycle 4: 5-14-2-1-6-5
- Cycle 5: 5-7-8-4-9-5
- Cycle 6: 9-4-8-7-5-9
- Cycle 7: 9-4-0-10-1-9
- Cycle 8: 9-7-8-6-3-9
- Cycle 9: 9-14-2-11-3-9
- Cycle 10: 1-6-8-7-11-1
- Cycle 11: 1-2-14-9-5-1
- Cycle 12: 1-12-13-7-5-1
- Cycle 13: 3-11-2-14-5-3
- Cycle 14: 4-0-10-6-8-4
- Cycle 15: 8-7-13-12-6-8

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4: 5-14-2-1-6-5 -> Chords: (1, 5)
- Cycle 6: 9-4-8-7-5-9 -> Chords: (4, 8) or (4, 7) or (8, 7)
- Cycle 10: 1-6-8-7-11-1 -> Chords: (6, 7)
- Cycle 11: 1-2-14-9-5-1 -> Chords: (2, 9)
- Cycle 12: 1-12-13-7-5-1 -> Chords: (12, 7)
- Cycle 13: 3-11-2-14-5-3 -> Chords: (11, 14) or (11, 2)
- Cycle 15: 8-7-13-12-6-8 -> Chords: (7, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of 7 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <5, 14, 1, 6> with chord (1, 5)
2. <9, 4, 8, 7> with chord (4, 8) or (4, 7) or (8, 7)
3. <1, 6, 8, 7> with chord (6, 7)
4. <1, 2, 14, 9> with chord (2, 9)
5. <1, 12, 13, 7> with chord (12, 7)
6. <3, 11, 2, 14> with chord (11, 14) or (11, 2)
7. <8, 7, 13, 12> with chord (7, 12)
