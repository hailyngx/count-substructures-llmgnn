Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 3, 2, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 4, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 0, 9, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 9, 2, 3, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 2, 3, 6, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 2, 4, 7, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 0, 7, 4, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 0, 1, 8, 9)
- Cycle 11: (4, 6, 3, 2, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 6, 5, 7, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 6, 0, 2, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 6, 7, 5, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 7, 5, 9, 4)
- Cycle 16: (4, 7, 0, 6, 4)
- Cycle 17: (7, 0, 1, 8, 7)
- Cycle 18: (7, 0, 9, 5, 7)
- Cycle 19: (7, 5, 9, 0, 7)
- Cycle 20: (7, 5, 3, 6, 7)
- Cycle 21: (3, 2, 9, 0, 3)
- Cycle 22: (3, 2, 4, 6, 3)
- Cycle 23: (8, 1, 0, 7, 8)
- Cycle 24: (8, 1, 8, 1, 8)
- Cycle 25: (6, 0, 1, 8, 6)
- Cycle 26: (6, 0, 9, 5, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 7), 8>
- <2, (3, 6), 9>
- <3, (4, 7), 5>
- <4, (0, 7), 9>
- <5, (9, 5), 7>
- <6, (3, 6), 5>
- <7, (0, 9), 5>
- <8, (1, 8), 0>
- <9, (4, 7), 3>
- <10, (5, 7), 9>
- <11, (2, 3), 6>
- <12, (4, 6), 2>
- <13, (0, 2), 4>
- <14, (5, 7), 4>
- <15, (0, 6), 4>
- <16, (5, 9), 7>
- <17, (1, 8), 7>
- <18, (0, 7), 5>
- <19, (3, 6), 7>
- <20, (0, 9), 7>
- <21, (2, 9), 3>
- <22, (4, 6), 3>
- <23, (0, 7), 8>
- <24, (1, 8), 1>
- <25, (0, 1), 8>
- <26, (5, 9), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [26]
