- <9, 28, 26, 8> has a chord (28, 8)
- <9, 28, 26, 14> has a chord (28, 14)
- <0, 9, 28, 26> has a chord (9, 26)

- <27, 5, 10, 14> has a chord (5, 14)
- <27, 5, 19, 4> has a chord (5, 4)
- <27, 4, 22, 13> has a chord (4, 13)
- <10, 5, 0, 9> has a chord (5, 9)
- <10, 16, 3, 26> has a chord (16, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 

As there are 29 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [29].
