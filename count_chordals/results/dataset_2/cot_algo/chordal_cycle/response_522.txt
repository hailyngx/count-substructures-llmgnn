Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 1) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. (5, 9, 6, 2, 5)
2. (5, 1, 3, 7, 5)
3. (5, 2, 1, 4, 5)
4. (9, 6, 2, 7, 9)
5. (1, 3, 8, 0, 1)
6. (6, 2, 1, 0, 6)
7. (7, 3, 0, 4, 7)
8. (3, 8, 9, 6, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has no chords.
- Cycle 6 has no chords.
- Cycle 7 has no chords.
- Cycle 8 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are 8 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 9, 6, 2>
<5, 1, 3, 7>
<5, 2, 1, 4>
<9, 6, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 8, 0>
<6, 2, 1, 0>
<7, 3, 0, 4>
<3, 8, 9, 6>
