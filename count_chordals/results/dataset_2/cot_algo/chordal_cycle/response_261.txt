Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:

1. Cycle: 1 - 6 - 9 - 2 - 1
2. Cycle: 1 - 6 - 5 - 3 - 1
3. Cycle: 1 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 1
4. Cycle: 1 - 6 - 7 - 0 - 8 - 1
5. Cycle: 9 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 9
6. Cycle: 9 - 6 - 5 - 3 - 9
7. Cycle: 9 - 6 - 7 - 0 - 8 - 9
8. Cycle: 7 - 6 - 5 - 3 - 7
9. Cycle: 7 - 6 - 1 - 4 - 7
10. Cycle: 7 - 6 - 1 - 8 - 7

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Cycle: 1 - 6 - 9 - 2 - 1 (Chord: (1, 9))
2. Cycle: 1 - 6 - 5 - 3 - 1 (Chord: (1, 5))
3. Cycle: 1 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 1 (Chord: (1, 7))
4. Cycle: 1 - 6 - 7 - 0 - 8 - 1 (Chord: (0, 6))
5. Cycle: 9 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 9 (Chord: (4, 9))
6. Cycle: 9 - 6 - 5 - 3 - 9 (Chord: (3, 9))
7. Cycle: 9 - 6 - 7 - 0 - 8 - 9 (Chord: (8, 9))
8. Cycle: 7 - 6 - 5 - 3 - 7 (Chord: (3, 7))
9. Cycle: 7 - 6 - 1 - 4 - 7 (Chord: (4, 7))
10. Cycle: 7 - 6 - 1 - 8 - 7 (Chord: (1, 8))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, (1, 9)>
<2, (1, 5)>
<3, (1, 7)>
<4, (0, 6)>
<5, (4, 9)>
<6, (3, 9)>
<7, (8, 9)>
<8, (3, 7)>
<9, (4, 7)>
<10, (1, 8)>
