Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (0, 8, 12, 2)
- (5, 13, 10, 1)
- (7, 11, 12, 2)
- (4, 1, 10, 5)

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, only the cycle (0, 8, 12, 2) has exactly one chord which is the edge (8, 12). Thus, we found a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 3.

Therefore, the final answer is [3], and the unique chordal 4-cycle is <0, 8, 12, 2>.
