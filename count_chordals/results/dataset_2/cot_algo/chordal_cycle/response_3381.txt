Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 19) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 2) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 15) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) (18, 12) (18, 19) (17, 3) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 15) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 19) (10, 9) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 15) (15, 12) (15, 14) (15, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 9-5-13-3-9
- Cycle 2: 1-9-19-18-12-7-5-13-1
- Cycle 3: 2-9-1-0-8-14-16-11-19-2
- Cycle 4: 14-8-0-6-7-12-18-19-11-16-14

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <9, (5, 13), 3>
- Cycle 2: <1, (9, 19), 18>
- Cycle 3: <2, (9, 1), 0>
- Cycle 4: <14, (8, 0), 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<9, (5, 13), 3>
<1, (9, 19), 18>
<2, (9, 1), 0>
<14, (8, 0), 6>
