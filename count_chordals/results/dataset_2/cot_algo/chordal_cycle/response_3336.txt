Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 22) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 19) (27, 6) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 28) (17, 11) (7, 14) (7, 25) (7, 9) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 23) (20, 14) (20, 25) (20, 0) (25, 17) (25, 7) (25, 20) (25, 2) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 18) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 22) (2, 25) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 28) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 28) (26, 3) (28, 17) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 13) (28, 5) (5, 28) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 3) (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 10) (9, 7) (9, 8) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 13) (16, 4) (1, 29) (1, 18) (29, 1) (29, 18) (23, 21) (23, 5) (3, 26) (3, 5) (3, 12) (24, 27) (24, 22) (6, 27) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 22) (22, 15) (22, 8) (22, 24) (22, 12) (11, 17) (11, 18) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 29) (18, 11) (19, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. (25, 7, 14, 20, 25)
2. (2, 4, 14, 20, 2)
3. (8, 2, 4, 14, 8)
4. (13, 21, 0, 20, 25, 2, 28, 13)
5. (5, 28, 13, 21, 23, 5)
6. (17, 25, 2, 4, 16, 17)
7. (7, 25, 2, 8, 9, 7)
8. (18, 0, 21, 13, 28, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <25, (7, 14), 20, 25>
- <2, (4, 14), 20, 2>
- <8, (2, 4), 14, 8>
- <13, (21, 0), 20, 25, 2, 28, 13>
- <5, 28, 13, (21, 23), 5>
- <17, (25, 2), 4, 16, 17>
- <7, 25, (2, 8), 9, 7>
- <18, 0, 21, 13, (28, 18)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 0 chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final result is [0].
