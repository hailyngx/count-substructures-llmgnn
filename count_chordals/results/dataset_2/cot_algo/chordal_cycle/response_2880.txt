Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 17) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 17) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 15) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 12) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 15) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 4) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 2) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 7) (18, 9) (18, 7) (15, 11) (15, 17) (2, 0) (2, 7) (10, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
1. (5, 8, 3, 4, 5)
2. (1, 17, 5, 19, 1)
3. (1, 12, 4, 13, 1)
4. (17, 9, 18, 7, 17)
5. (4, 19, 14, 7, 4)
6. (16, 3, 11, 15, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (12, 5), 4>
2. <4, (13, 6), 1>
3. <17, (5, 19), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [3].
