Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 17) (12, 15) (12, 19) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 0) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 1) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 9) (9, 19) (16, 17) (16, 10) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (10, 2) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 15) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 3) (17, 7) (17, 16) (17, 11) (15, 12) (15, 0) (15, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-13-6-4-1-11
- Cycle 2: 0-5-13-19-12-15
- Cycle 3: 1-4-6-13-19-18
- Cycle 4: 2-10-14-3-2
- Cycle 5: 7-11-17-16-10

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has chord (1, 19).
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord in the given graph, which is <1, (4, 19), 18)>.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
