Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more without a chord in this graph.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more with exactly one chord in this graph.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
