Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 10) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- Cycle 1: 4-7-6-13-4
- Cycle 2: 4-7-10-13-4
- Cycle 3: 4-7-1-5-4
- Cycle 4: 4-7-1-10-4
- Cycle 5: 4-7-2-6-4
- Cycle 6: 4-12-9-14-4
- Cycle 7: 4-12-11-6-4
- Cycle 8: 7-6-13-10-7
- Cycle 9: 7-6-11-8-7
- Cycle 10: 7-6-2-9-7
- Cycle 11: 10-1-5-14-10
- Cycle 12: 10-1-7-4-10
- Cycle 13: 10-1-5-14-10
- Cycle 14: 10-9-14-0-10
- Cycle 15: 10-9-3-0-10
- Cycle 16: 1-7-6-2-1
- Cycle 17: 1-7-4-13-1
- Cycle 18: 11-8-0-12-11
- Cycle 19: 11-8-14-9-11
- Cycle 20: 11-8-12-4-11
- Cycle 21: 12-9-3-0-12
- Cycle 22: 12-9-14-8-12

Step 2: 
- The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
<4, (7, 6), 13)> 

Step 3:
- The final number of chordless cycles found is [21].
