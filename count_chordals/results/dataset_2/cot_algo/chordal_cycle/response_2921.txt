Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are as follows:

2. Cycle 1-9-0-4 
3. Cycle 1-9-7-8 
4. Cycle 1-3-2-8 
5. Cycle 1-3-6-5 
6. Cycle 1-5-4-0 
7. Cycle 1-5-6-7 
8. Cycle 2-9-7-8 
9. Cycle 2-3-8-4 
10. Cycle 2-3-6-5 
11. Cycle 2-4-8-7 
12. Cycle 3-6-5-0 
13. Cycle 3-1-5-4 
14. Cycle 3-1-9-7 
15. Cycle 4-8-7-2 
16. Cycle 4-8-3-1 
17. Cycle 4-0-5-6 
18. Cycle 5-6-7-2 
19. Cycle 5-0-4-8 
20. Cycle 6-7-2-3 
21. Cycle 7-8-4-0 

Step 2:  
Out of the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles are:  
1. Chordal 4-cycle <1, (9, 7), 8, 3>  
2. Chordal 4-cycle <1, (9, 0), 4, 5>  
3. Chordal 4-cycle <1, (3, 2), 8, 5>  
4. Chordal 4-cycle <1, (3, 6), 5, 7>  
5. Chordal 4-cycle <1, (5, 4), 0, 6>  
6. Chordal 4-cycle <1, (5, 6), 7, 3>  
7. Chordal 4-cycle <2, (9, 7), 8, 3>  
8. Chordal 4-cycle <2, (3, 8), 4, 5>  
9. Chordal 4-cycle <2, (3, 6), 5, 1>  
10. Chordal 4-cycle <2, (4, 8), 7, 3>  
11. Chordal 4-cycle <3, (6, 5), 0, 1>  
12. Chordal 4-cycle <4, (8, 7), 2, 3>  

Step 3:  
Total number of chordless 4-cycles found: [12]
