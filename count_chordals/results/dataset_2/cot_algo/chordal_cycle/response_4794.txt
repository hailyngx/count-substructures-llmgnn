Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 11) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 15) (11, 10) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 19) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 18) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 13) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 3) (5, 15) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 16) 

Response:
First, we need to list all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph. 

One of the cycles is <3, 4, 7, 8, 3>.
Another cycle is <3, 15, 11, 10, 3>.
Another cycle is <3, 5, 15, 11, 3>.
Another cycle is <3, 14, 13, 1, 3>.
Another cycle is <4, 9, 13, 1, 4>.
Another cycle is <4, 9, 6, 2, 4>.
Another cycle is <4, 19, 17, 10, 4>.
Another cycle is <7, 4, 9, 6, 7>.
Another cycle is <10, 17, 16, 8, 10>.
Another cycle is <10, 19, 17, 16, 10>.
Another cycle is <11, 15, 5, 3, 11>.
Another cycle is <12, 8, 7, 4, 12>.
Another cycle is <12, 2, 6, 9, 12>.
Another cycle is <13, 1, 18, 16, 13>.
Another cycle is <13, 19, 4, 3, 13>.
Another cycle is <14, 3, 5, 15, 14>.
Another cycle is <16, 17, 19, 13, 16>.
Another cycle is <16, 8, 12, 2, 16>.
Another cycle is <17, 19, 13, 1, 17>.
This is a list of cycles of length 4 or more that exist in the graph.
   
Let's identify the unique chordal 4-cycles:
<3, (15, 5), 11>
<3, (4, 7), 8>
<4, (9, 6), 2>
<4, (19, 17), 10>
<10, (17, 16), 8>
<10, (19, 17), 16>
<13, (19, 4), 3>
<16, (17, 19), 13>

A total of [8] unique chordal 4-cycles were found in the graph.
