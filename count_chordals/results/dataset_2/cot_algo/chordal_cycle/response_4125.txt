Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-0-4-5
- Cycle 3: 5-3-6-5
- Cycle 4: 9-6-5-9
- Cycle 5: 9-0-4-9
- Cycle 6: 6-1-8-6
- Cycle 7: 6-7-3-6
- Cycle 8: 6-4-0-6
- Cycle 9: 4-0-5-4
- Cycle 10: 4-6-5-4
- Cycle 11: 2-5-0-2
- Cycle 12: 2-1-6-2
- Cycle 13: 2-3-7-2
- Cycle 14: 2-7-6-2
- Cycle 15: 1-6-7-1
- Cycle 16: 1-8-6-1
- Cycle 17: 1-2-5-1
- Cycle 18: 1-7-3-1
- Cycle 19: 3-2-7-3
- Cycle 20: 3-5-6-3
- Cycle 21: 3-7-1-3
- Cycle 22: 7-6-1-7
- Cycle 23: 7-8-1-7
- Cycle 24: 7-2-3-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 4, 9, 6> (Chord: (5, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 0, 4, 6> (Chord: (0, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 3, 6, 9> (Chord: (3, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6, 1, 8, 7> (Chord: (1, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, 3, 7, 1> (Chord: (3, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, 4, 5, 0> (Chord: (4, 5))
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, 2, 3, 1> (Chord: (2, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <7, 6, 1, 8> (Chord: (6, 8))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final answer is [8].
