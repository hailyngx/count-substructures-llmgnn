Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 14) (27, 9) (14, 27) (14, 17) (14, 26) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (21, 5) (21, 22) (3, 20) (3, 26) (3, 22) (11, 19) (11, 4) (24, 10) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 3) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 23) (16, 10) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 20) (2, 7) (2, 0) (22, 21) (22, 3) (22, 6) (22, 1) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 29) (18, 13) (19, 11) (19, 18) (9, 27) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 4) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 18) (5, 12) (8, 7) (8, 10) (1, 28) (1, 22) (1, 25) (20, 3) (20, 28) (4, 11) (4, 9) (25, 1) (25, 6) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 12) (12, 17) (12, 28) (12, 5) (12, 23) (6, 22) (6, 25) (6, 10) (6, 0) (10, 24) (10, 16) (10, 8) (10, 6) (29, 16) (29, 18) (29, 0) (13, 18) (13, 23) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (15, 27, 14, 26, 15)
- Cycle 2: (7, 9, 18, 19, 11, 4, 9)
- Cycle 3: (21, 5, 18, 29, 16, 23, 12, 17, 5)
- Cycle 4: (3, 26, 14, 17, 12, 28, 1, 22, 3)
- Cycle 5: (22, 1, 28, 16, 29, 18, 5, 21, 22)
- Cycle 6: (10, 24, 10)
- Cycle 7: (0, 6, 22, 1, 28, 16, 10, 6, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (14, 26), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (18, 19), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (18, 29), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (14, 17), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (16, 29), 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (16, 28), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (1, 28), 22>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
