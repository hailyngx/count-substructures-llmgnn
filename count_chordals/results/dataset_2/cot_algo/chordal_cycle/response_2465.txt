Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 4, 13, 12, 7)
- Cycle 2: (11, 7, 6, 4, 10)
- Cycle 3: (5, 2, 1, 8, 4)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- For Cycle 1 <6, 4, 13, 12, 7>: Chords: (6, 12), (4, 7)
- For Cycle 2 <11, 7, 6, 4, 10>: Chords: (11, 4)
- For Cycle 3 <5, 2, 1, 8, 4>: Chords: (5, 1)

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [0]
