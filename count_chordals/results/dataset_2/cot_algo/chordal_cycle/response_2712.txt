Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (3, 4, 5, 9)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 14, 5)
- Cycle 3: (4, 0, 1, 14)
- Cycle 4: (10, 6, 13, 1)
- Cycle 5: (14, 0, 11, 8)
- Cycle 6: (2, 9, 8, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 11, 0, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord (5, 9) with chordless cycle <3, (5, 9), 4>
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 14) with chordless cycle <0, (1, 14), 5>
- Cycle 3 has a chord (0, 1) with chordless cycle <4, (0, 1), 14>
- Cycle 4 has a chord (6, 1) with chordless cycle <10, (6, 1), 13>
- Cycle 5 has a chord (0, 14) with chordless cycle <8, (0, 14), 11>
- Cycle 6 has a chord (9, 8) with chordless cycle <7, (9, 8), 7>
- Cycle 7 has a chord (0, 11) with chordless cycle <4, (0, 11), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
