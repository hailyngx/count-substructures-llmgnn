Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 1-3-6-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-6-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-8-7-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-2-4-1
- Cycle 5: 3-6-5-7-3
- Cycle 6: 3-7-6-4-3
- Cycle 7: 3-9-0-4-3
- Cycle 8: 4-0-9-2-4
- Cycle 9: 4-6-7-5-4
- Cycle 10: 8-1-5-7-8
- Cycle 11: 8-6-7-9-8
- Cycle 12: 8-7-3-6-8
- Cycle 13: 5-6-4-0-5
- Cycle 14: 5-7-6-3-5
- Cycle 15: 6-3-7-2-6
- Cycle 16: 6-4-0-3-6
- Cycle 17: 6-8-7-5-6
- Cycle 18: 6-5-1-8-6
- Cycle 19: 2-4-0-3-2
- Cycle 20: 2-9-7-5-2
- Cycle 21: 2-7-5-1-2
- Cycle 22: 7-3-0-4-7
- Cycle 23: 7-8-1-5-7
- Cycle 24: 7-5-6-8-7
- Cycle 25: 7-6-4-2-7
- Cycle 26: 7-2-9-3-7
- Cycle 27: 0-3-6-4-0
- Cycle 28: 0-4-6-8-0
- Cycle 29: 0-9-2-7-0
- Cycle 30: 9-1-8-7-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the listed cycles, the only chordal 4-cycle is:

<3, (1, 5), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [0] chordless cycles in this graph.
