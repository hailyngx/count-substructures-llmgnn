Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-3-13-0-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-11-9-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-2-13-1
- Cycle 4: 1-0-5-12-1
- Cycle 5: 1-0-9-14-1
- Cycle 6: 1-8-6-0-1
- Cycle 7: 3-11-9-13-3
- Cycle 8: 3-8-6-10-3
- Cycle 9: 3-13-9-0-3
- Cycle 10: 10-6-8-12-10
- Cycle 11: 10-2-14-9-10
- Cycle 12: 11-9-13-12-11
- Cycle 13: 8-6-0-13-8
- Cycle 14: 2-7-1-0-2
- Cycle 15: 2-14-9-11-2
- Cycle 16: 2-4-6-8-2
- Cycle 17: 2-13-0-5-2
- Cycle 18: 6-8-12-5-6
- Cycle 19: 6-0-1-7-6
- Cycle 20: 6-4-2-13-6
- Cycle 21: 13-9-11-3-13
- Cycle 22: 13-0-1-7-13
- Cycle 23: 0-5-12-9-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <1, 0, (5, 12), 1>
- <1, 3, (11, 9), 1>
- <1, 7, (2, 13), 1>
- <1, 8, (6, 0), 1>
- <3, 11, (9, 13), 3>
- <3, 8, (6, 10), 3>
- <3, 13, (9, 0), 3>
- <10, 6, (8, 12), 10>
- <10, 2, (14, 9), 10>
- <11, 9, (13, 12), 11>
- <8, 6, (0, 13), 8>
- <2, 7, (1, 0), 2>
- <2, 14, (9, 11), 2>
- <2, 4, (6, 8), 2>
- <2, 13, (0, 5), 2>
- <6, 8, (12, 10), 6>
- <6, 0, (1, 7), 6>
- <6, 4, (2, 13), 6>
- <13, 9, (11, 3), 13>
- <13, 0, (1, 7), 13>
- <0, 5, (2, 7), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [3]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are: 
<1, 3, (11, 9), 1>
<3, 8, (6, 10), 3>
<11, 9, (13, 12), 11>
