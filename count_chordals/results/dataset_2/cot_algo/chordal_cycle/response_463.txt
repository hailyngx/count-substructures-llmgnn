Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4: 
- (5, 2, 4, 7)
- (5, 8, 9, 7)
- (5, 1, 0, 9)
- (5, 7, 4, 8)
- (9, 8, 4, 7)
- (4, 7, 2, 5)
- (4, 8, 1, 5)
- (7, 5, 2, 4)
- (7, 9, 8, 4)
- (8, 5, 2, 7)
- (8, 9, 7, 4)
- (6, 3, 4, 7)
- (2, 5, 1, 8)
- (2, 4, 7, 1)
- (1, 5, 8, 9)
- (3, 4, 8, 1)
- (3, 8, 9, 7)
- (0, 9, 8, 5)
- (0, 6, 3, 4)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (5, 9), 8>
- <2, (4, 7), 5>
- <3, (1, 8), 3>
- <4, (2, 7), 5>

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles found: [15]
