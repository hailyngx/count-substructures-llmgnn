Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 17) (6, 14) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 7) (25, 19) (25, 8) (25, 18) (8, 25) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 27) (22, 3) (22, 9) (22, 28) (23, 26) (23, 16) (23, 20) (27, 13) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 28) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 21) (12, 1) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 10) (24, 20) (26, 23) (26, 24) (26, 0) (11, 28) (11, 5) (11, 20) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 11) (28, 2) (18, 25) (18, 27) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 24) (16, 10) (21, 12) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 19) (29, 15) (29, 1) (14, 6) (14, 27) (20, 23) (20, 24) (20, 11) (20, 1) (2, 7) (2, 28) (2, 0) (19, 25) (19, 1) (17, 15) (17, 9) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 16) (5, 4) (5, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle: <3, 15, 29, 1>
2. Cycle: <3, 15, 17, 9>
3. Cycle: <3, 15, 17, 7>
4. Cycle: <15, 17, 9, 22>
5. Cycle: <15, 17, 7, 27>
6. Cycle: <15, 17, 9, 22>
7. Cycle: <9, 22, 3, 15>
8. Cycle: <9, 22, 28, 4>
9. Cycle: <9, 22, 28, 11>
10. Cycle: <9, 22, 28, 2>
11. Cycle: <9, 17, 7, 27>
12. Cycle: <9, 17, 15, 3>
13. Cycle: <9, 17, 15, 29>
14. Cycle: <22, 28, 4, 8>
15. Cycle: <22, 28, 4, 10>
16. Cycle: <22, 28, 11, 5>
17. Cycle: <27, 13, 8, 25>
18. Cycle: <27, 14, 6, 17>
19. Cycle: <4, 8, 25, 19>
20. Cycle: <4, 28, 11, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles found:
1. Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 15, 29, 1> (Chord: (15, 1))
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <15, 17, 9, 22> (Chord: (17, 9))
3. Chordal 4-cycle: <15, 17, 7, 27> (Chord: (17, 7))
4. Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 22, 28, 4> (Chord: (22, 4))
5. Chordal 4-cycle: <27, 13, 8, 25> (Chord: (13, 25))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
