Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 18) (15, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (10, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 2) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (9, 17) (9, 4) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 17) (12, 11) (19, 7) (19, 16) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 16) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 8) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 2) (14, 5) (14, 7) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 7, 14, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 13, 2, 7, 14, 5)
- Cycle 3: (0, 17, 9, 4, 1, 11, 0)
- Cycle 4: (4, 1, 11, 12, 17, 9, 4)
- Cycle 5: (6, 7, 19, 16, 2, 13, 5, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- For Cycle 1, there is no chord.
- For Cycle 2, there is one chord: (13, 7).
- For Cycle 3, there is one chord: (17, 4).
- For Cycle 4, there is one chord: (11, 9).
- For Cycle 5, there is no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the number inside brackets is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (13, 7), 5, 6>
- <4, (17, 4), 9, 11>
- <6, 7, 14, 5>
