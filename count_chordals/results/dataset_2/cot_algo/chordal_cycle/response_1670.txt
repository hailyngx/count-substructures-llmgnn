Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more that can be found in the graph are:
- <1, 3, 7, 4>
- <3, 10, 11, 1>
- <3, 5, 11, 12>
- <3, 8, 10, 14>
- <5, 11, 1, 9>
- <9, 7, 3, 1>
- <9, 0, 11, 12>
- <9, 2, 10, 8>
- <10, 14, 12, 6>
- <12, 11, 0, 9>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, 3, 7, 4> with chord (3, 7)
- <3, 10, 11, 1> with chord (10, 1)
- <3, 5, 11, 12> with chord (5, 11)
- <5, 11, 1, 9> with chord (11, 1)
- <9, 7, 3, 1> with chord (7, 3)

Step 3:
There are a total of [5] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
