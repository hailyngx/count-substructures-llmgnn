Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (1, 5, 2, 6)
- (1, 5, 7, 3)
- (1, 5, 0, 2)
- (1, 5, 7, 8)
- (1, 0, 3, 7)
- (1, 0, 4, 6)
- (1, 0, 3, 9)
- (1, 8, 7, 3)
- (1, 8, 7, 5)
- (1, 8, 7, 6)
- (1, 8, 7, 5)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the cycle (1, 0, 3, 9) has exactly one chord (1, 9). Therefore, it is a unique chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle found, so the count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <1, (1, 9), 3>
