Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-6-2-0
- Cycle 2: 1-6-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-8-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-4-7-1
- Cycle 5: 1-9-4-3-1
- Cycle 6: 2-6-1-3-2
- Cycle 7: 2-6-5-4-2
- Cycle 8: 3-0-5-6-3
- Cycle 9: 4-3-1-7-4
- Cycle 10: 4-5-6-2-4
- Cycle 11: 5-0-3-4-5

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, only one cycle has exactly one chord which is a chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 4, 9, 7, 1>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have a total of [10] chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
