Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 13) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 26) (25, 15) (8, 27) (13, 3) (13, 17) (7, 21) (7, 12) (21, 7) (21, 16) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 12) (22, 1) (23, 3) (23, 29) (23, 0) (23, 9) (4, 24) (4, 16) (4, 26) (4, 2) (12, 7) (12, 22) (12, 1) (17, 13) (17, 29) (17, 15) (29, 23) (29, 17) (29, 6) (10, 6) (9, 22) (9, 23) (26, 25) (26, 4) (26, 0) (16, 21) (16, 4) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 27) (28, 5) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 24) (14, 27) (14, 24) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (0, 23) (0, 26) (11, 18) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 20) (24, 4) (24, 19) (24, 14) (24, 11) (24, 27) (1, 22) (1, 12) (1, 28) (1, 11) (6, 29) (6, 10) (20, 11) (20, 27) (27, 8) (27, 28) (27, 14) (27, 24) (27, 20) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 2) (2, 4) (2, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (3, 25, 15, 5, 22, 12, 7, 21, 16, 4, 26, 0, 23, 29, 17, 13, 3)
        
Step 2: Check the cycle for exactly one chord:
        This cycle has one chord: (12, 22)
        
Therefore, there is 1 chordal 4-cycle in the given graph.

Final Answer: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <(3, 25), (15, 5), (21, 16), (13, 3)>
