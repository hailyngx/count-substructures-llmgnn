Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 2) (27, 24) (27, 20) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 21) (22, 23) (22, 15) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 25) (23, 28) (2, 0) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 2) (18, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 17) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 4) (28, 10) (21, 3) (21, 28) (11, 17) (11, 29) (19, 5) (19, 24) (19, 13) (19, 20) (9, 2) (9, 29) (9, 10) (29, 11) (29, 9) (29, 25) (29, 4) (7, 18) (7, 16) (7, 15) (16, 7) (26, 23) (26, 8) (15, 0) (15, 22) (15, 7) (15, 25) (17, 6) (17, 11) (20, 27) (20, 19) (20, 14) (20, 10) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 14) (24, 0) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 25) (25, 23) (25, 29) (25, 15) (25, 24) (8, 1) (8, 26) (8, 12) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 10) (4, 5) (4, 28) (4, 29) (10, 28) (10, 9) (10, 20) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- Cycle 1: 0-15-22-23-26-8-1-3-21-28-6-5-19-24-27-20-10-9-2
- Cycle 2: 0-15-22-23-25-29-9-2-18-7-16-26-8-12-1
- Cycle 3: 0-15-25-23-28-6-5-19-24-27-20-10
- Cycle 4: 1-3-21-28-6-5-19-24-27-20-10-14-13
- Cycle 5: 16-7-18-2-9-29-25-24-19

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 2, 10, 24>
- <1, 21, 6, 28>
- <8, 26, 16, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 5 chordless cycles found. Therefore, the final number is [5].
