Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 20) (2, 11) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 1) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 27) (26, 7) (26, 0) (26, 4) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 25) (24, 21) (24, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (22, 6) (22, 29) (22, 1) (22, 8) (4, 26) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 3) (27, 19) (27, 4) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 8) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 25) (7, 10) (7, 5) (25, 21) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 15) (16, 0) (11, 2) (11, 24) (11, 8) (11, 17) (5, 7) (5, 23) (5, 17) (5, 10) (23, 5) (23, 29) (23, 20) (13, 21) (13, 9) (13, 10) (28, 10) (3, 4) (8, 22) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 15) (1, 18) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 25) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 12) (29, 19) (29, 22) (29, 23) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 23) (6, 22) (6, 25) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 28) (12, 9) (12, 17) (15, 25) (15, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 2-20-23-5-7-26-4-1-22-29-19-27
- Cycle 2: 0-26-7-25-6-22-1-18-19-27-4
- Cycle 3: 11-2-20-23-5-7-25-21-24
- Cycle 4: 0-26-4-1-18-19-27-4
- Cycle 5: 7-26-0-8-22-1-18-19-27
- Cycle 6: 0-26-7-5-23-20-18-19-27
- Cycle 7: 0-26-4-27-19-18-1-25-21
- Cycle 8: 0-7-25-21-24-11-8-22-29
- Cycle 9: 0-26-4-14-15-25-21-24
- Cycle 10: 7-25-1-18-19-27-4-14-8
- Cycle 11: 0-26-7-5-17-12-9-13
- Cycle 12: 0-26-7-10-5-17-11-8

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 4: 0-26-4-1-18-19-27-4 has a chord 1-18
- Cycle 5: 7-26-0-8-22-1-18-19-27 has a chord 1-18
- Cycle 11: 0-26-7-5-17-12-9-13 has a chord 5-12
- Cycle 12: 0-26-7-10-5-17-11-8 has a chord 7-11

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have a total of [8] chordless cycles.

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, 18, 4, 26>
<1, 18, 19, 27>
<5, 12, 17, 7>
<7, 11, 17, 5>
