Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (17, 13) (17, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 2) (5, 13) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 12) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 3) (15, 9) (16, 12) (16, 6) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 6) (12, 13) (12, 16) (3, 17) (3, 9) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 11) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 6) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 6) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 2) 

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <4, 7, 10, 0, 4>
- Cycle <4, 8, 10, 7, 4>
- Cycle <4, 8, 9, 1, 4>
- Cycle <4, 11, 1, 14, 4>
- Cycle <4, 11, 6, 16, 4>
- Cycle <4, 14, 0, 10, 4>
- Cycle <4, 14, 18, 19, 4>
- Cycle <7, 8, 10, 0, 7>
- Cycle <8, 9, 1, 14, 8>
- Cycle <8, 9, 3, 17, 8>
- Cycle <8, 9, 15, 9, 8>
- Cycle <8, 10, 0, 14, 8>
- Cycle <8, 10, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle <10, 0, 14, 18, 10>
- Cycle <14, 18, 6, 11, 14>
- Cycle <19, 18, 14, 1, 19>
- Cycle <19, 18, 6, 2, 19>
- Cycle <9, 1, 11, 6, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only <4, 8, 9, 1, 4> has exactly one chord (8, 1).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Therefore, we have found one unique chordal 4-cycle: <4, 8, 9, 1, 4> with chord (8, 1).
