Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 6) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 3) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 0-5-6-13-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-14-9-0
- Cycle 3: 0-7-12-8-0
- Cycle 4: 0-7-2-10-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1: One chord (6, 13)
- Cycle 2: One chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 3: No chord
- Cycle 4: One chord (7, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There is 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1]. 
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 7, 12, 8, 0>.
