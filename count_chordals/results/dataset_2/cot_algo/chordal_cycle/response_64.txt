Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 15) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 9) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 8) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 9) (1, 16) (5, 10) (5, 14) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 18) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 18) (17, 8) (17, 16) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 19) (9, 14) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (13, 19) (13, 3) (13, 18) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 13) (18, 0) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2: 
- There are no chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.

Step 3:
- The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
