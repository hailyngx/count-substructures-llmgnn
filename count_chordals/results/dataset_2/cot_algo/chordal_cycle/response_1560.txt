Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 20) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 20) (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 15) (5, 4) (9, 0) (9, 24) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 29) (17, 8) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (29, 17) (29, 14) (15, 22) (15, 20) (15, 2) (20, 11) (20, 16) (20, 15) (20, 27) (26, 13) (26, 3) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 7) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 21) (19, 10) (19, 27) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 21) (6, 1) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 6) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 24) (1, 6) (1, 25) (1, 8) (4, 22) (4, 5) (28, 18) (28, 24) (28, 23) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 27) (24, 9) (24, 2) (24, 28) (24, 8) (24, 23) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 14) (27, 20) (27, 19) (27, 8) (27, 3) (3, 10) (3, 26) (3, 27) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 25) (23, 28) (23, 24) (23, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (16, 20, 15, 22, 16)
- Cycle 2: (10, 21, 18, 14, 25, 10)
- Cycle 3: (10, 21, 6, 7, 12, 10)
- Cycle 4: (10, 21, 6, 1, 8, 10)
- Cycle 5: (10, 3, 26, 13, 18, 10)
- Cycle 6: (10, 3, 27, 20, 15, 10)
- Cycle 7: (10, 12, 7, 16, 20, 10)
- Cycle 8: (10, 12, 2, 24, 8, 10)
- Cycle 9: (13, 18, 14, 29, 17, 13)
- Cycle 10: (13, 18, 21, 10, 3, 13)
- Cycle 11: (13, 22, 4, 5, 4)
- Cycle 12: (15, 20, 16, 0, 7, 15)
- Cycle 13: (18, 21, 6, 1, 25, 18)
- Cycle 14: (18, 21, 10, 12, 2, 18)
- Cycle 15: (18, 21, 10, 3, 26, 18)
- Cycle 16: (18, 14, 25, 23, 28, 18)
- Cycle 17: (20, 27, 19, 10, 21, 20)
- Cycle 18: (23, 25, 14, 18, 21, 23)
- Cycle 19: (27, 19, 10, 12, 2, 27)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <16, 20, 15, 22, 16> has a chord (15, 22) as (20, 22) is the non-adjacent edge.
- <10, 12, 7, 16, 20, 10> has a chord (12, 16) as (7, 20) is the non-adjacent edge.
- <10, 21, 18, 14, 25, 10> has a chord (18, 25) as (21, 14) is the non-adjacent edge.
- <10, 21, 6, 1, 8, 10> has a chord (6, 8) as (21, 1) is the non-adjacent edge.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <10, 21, 18, 14, 25, 10>
