Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 11) (1, 9) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 5) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 5) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 13) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 18) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 18) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 6-10-15-8-6
- Cycle 2: 6-10-5-15-6
- Cycle 3: 6-13-12-16-6
- Cycle 4: 6-13-4-19-6
- Cycle 5: 6-8-11-9-6
- Cycle 6: 9-2-11-8-9
- Cycle 7: 9-11-12-14-9
- Cycle 8: 9-1-17-5-9
- Cycle 9: 9-1-17-5-15-10-6-8-9
- Cycle 10: 9-11-14-5-15-10-6-13-9
- Cycle 11: 9-11-14-12-16-18-15-10-5-9
- Cycle 12: 15-8-11-14-12-16-18-15
- Cycle 13: 15-8-11-9-1-17-5-15
- Cycle 14: 15-8-11-9-1-17-5-14-12-16-18-15
- Cycle 15: 15-10-6-13-12-16-18-15

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 9 <6, 13, 4, 19>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
