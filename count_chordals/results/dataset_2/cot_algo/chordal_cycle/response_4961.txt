Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 27) (1, 3) (1, 23) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 26) (3, 22) (7, 17) (21, 28) (21, 11) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 28) (11, 21) (11, 29) (11, 20) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 17) (8, 29) (19, 3) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 15) (26, 3) (26, 10) (26, 19) (26, 29) (28, 21) (28, 10) (28, 4) (28, 14) (5, 18) (5, 29) (13, 16) (13, 20) (25, 27) (25, 14) (25, 24) (25, 2) (27, 9) (27, 10) (27, 25) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 18) (2, 10) (2, 25) (2, 22) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 24) (22, 17) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 16) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 14) (14, 28) (14, 25) (14, 15) (23, 1) (23, 15) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 26) (29, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 24) (24, 25) (24, 22) (24, 12) (24, 20) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 22) (20, 11) (20, 13) (20, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle: <1, 3, 26, 10, 2>
2. Cycle: <1, 3, 22, 17, 0>
3. Cycle: <1, 3, 22, 24, 20>
4. Cycle: <1, 23, 15, 19, 26>
5. Cycle: <1, 23, 15, 14, 25>
6. Cycle: <1, 23, 29, 5, 18>
7. Cycle: <3, 1, 23, 15, 19>
8. Cycle: <3, 1, 23, 29, 5>
9. Cycle: <3, 26, 19, 18, 5>
10. Cycle: <3, 26, 19, 15, 23>
11. Cycle: <3, 19, 18, 16, 13>
12. Cycle: <3, 19, 26, 10, 2>
13. Cycle: <3, 22, 2, 10, 26>
14. Cycle: <3, 22, 24, 20, 11>
15. Cycle: <3, 22, 24, 25, 14>
16. Cycle: <7, 17, 22, 24, 12>
17. Cycle: <10, 26, 19, 18, 5>
18. Cycle: <10, 26, 19, 15, 23>
19. Cycle: <10, 2, 25, 14, 28>
20. Cycle: <11, 20, 24, 25, 14>
21. Cycle: <11, 21, 28, 4, 17>
22. Cycle: <11, 21, 28, 10, 26>
23. Cycle: <11, 29, 5, 18, 16>
24. Cycle: <13, 16, 0, 17, 22>
25. Cycle: <13, 16, 18, 5, 29>
26. Cycle: <15, 23, 1, 3, 26>
27. Cycle: <15, 23, 1, 23, 15>
28. Cycle: <15, 23, 29, 5, 18>
29. Cycle: <19, 3, 26, 10, 2>
30. Cycle: <19, 3, 26, 29, 11>
31. Cycle: <19, 18, 16, 13, 20>
32. Cycle: <21, 28, 10, 26, 19>
33. Cycle: <22, 2, 10, 26, 29>
34. Cycle: <22, 24, 20, 11, 21>
35. Cycle: <22, 24, 25, 14, 28>
36. Cycle: <24, 12, 0, 16, 18>
37. Cycle: <24, 12, 6, 9, 27>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

From the above list of cycles, we can identify the chordal 4-cycles as:

1. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 23, 15, 19> with chord {3, 26}
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 23, 29, 5> with chord {15, 18}
3. Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 22, 24, 20> with chord {1, 23}
4. Chordal 4-cycle: <10, 2, 25, 14> with chord {26, 28}

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 37 cycles listed and 4 of them are chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 37 - 4 = 33.

Final answer: [33]
