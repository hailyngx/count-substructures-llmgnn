Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 8, 6, 3)
- Cycle 3: (0, 3, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 4: (0, 4, 2, 9, 8)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 2, 9, 8)
- Cycle 6: (1, 4, 7, 6, 3)
- Cycle 7: (1, 8, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 8: (6, 7, 4, 2, 9)
- Cycle 9: (6, 7, 1, 8, 9)
- Cycle 10: (6, 8, 1, 4, 7)
- Cycle 11: (6, 8, 3, 0, 9)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1 (with chord (4, 2)): <1, 4, 7, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2 (with chord (1, 8)): <1, 8, 6, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3 (with chord (6, 7)): <6, 7, 4, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4 (with chord (1, 8)): <1, 8, 6, 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found which is 7.
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [4].
