Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 15) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 11) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 5) (4, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 15) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 15) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 18) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 16) (13, 2) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 4) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 18) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 18) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Here are the cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 14 - 11 - 10 - 1 - 14
- Cycle 2: 17 - 14 - 1 - 11 - 17
- Cycle 3: 3 - 17 - 14 - 1 - 3
- Cycle 4: 5 - 17 - 14 - 11 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the cycles listed above, only Cycle 1 (14 - 11 - 10 - 1 - 14) has exactly one chord: (11, 1).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <<11, 1, 14, 10>>
