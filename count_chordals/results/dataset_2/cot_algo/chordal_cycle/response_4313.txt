Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 7 - 4 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 7 - 4 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 8 - 5 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 8 - 9 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 9 - 2 - 3 - 0

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 7 - 4 - 5 - 0 (Chord: 4-5)
- Cycle 2: 0 - 7 - 4 - 9 - 0 (Chord: 4-9)
- Cycle 3: 0 - 8 - 5 - 2 - 0 (Chord: 5-2)
- Cycle 4: 0 - 8 - 9 - 4 - 0 (Chord: 9-4)
- Cycle 5: 0 - 9 - 2 - 3 - 0 (Chord: 2-3)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 7, 4, 5, 0> (Chord: (4, 5))
- <0, 7, 4, 9, 0> (Chord: (4, 9))
- <0, 8, 5, 2, 0> (Chord: (5, 2))
- <0, 8, 9, 4, 0> (Chord: (9, 4))
- <0, 9, 2, 3, 0> (Chord: (2, 3))
