Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 9) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (22, 26) (22, 9) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (9, 16) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 20) (28, 26) (28, 4) (28, 25) (17, 20) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 18) (20, 9) (20, 17) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (15, 26) (15, 10) (29, 16) (29, 6) (29, 3) (8, 21) (8, 6) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 13) (25, 28) (25, 23) (27, 7) (27, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 29) (6, 8) (6, 24) (6, 3) (24, 6) (24, 2) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 24) (1, 12) (1, 27) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 19) (18, 17) (18, 23) (18, 3) (23, 25) (23, 18) (23, 4) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 10) (4, 23) (3, 12) (3, 29) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 18) 

Response:
Step 1:  
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
   - Cycle 1: (11, 16, 29, 6) 
   - Cycle 2: (7, 21, 8, 6)
   - Cycle 3: (7, 21, 8, 6, 29)
   - Cycle 4: (12, 2, 10, 15)
   - Cycle 5: (12, 1, 27, 7)
   - Cycle 6: (0, 14, 7, 21)
   - Cycle 7: (22, 26, 28, 4)
   - Cycle 8: (17, 20, 9, 22)
   - Cycle 9: (19, 17, 20, 9)
   - Cycle 10: (25, 28, 26, 15)
   - Cycle 11: (5, 11, 16, 9)
   - Cycle 12: (6, 29, 16, 11)
   - Cycle 13: (24, 6, 29, 16)
   - Cycle 14: (2, 12, 7, 14)
   - Cycle 15: (2, 12, 13, 19)
   - Cycle 16: (4, 9, 22, 26)
   - Cycle 17: (3, 6, 8, 21)
   - Cycle 18: (3, 5, 11, 16)
   
Step 2:  
- Cycles with exactly one chord are:  
  - <1, (5, 17), 7, 21>  
  - <2, (10, 24), 12, 13>  
  - <3, (6, 18), 29, 16>  
  - <4, (23, 28), 26, 22>  
  - <8, (19, 27), 21, 7>  

Step 3:  
- Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
