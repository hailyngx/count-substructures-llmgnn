Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 1 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 7 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 3 - 1 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 4 (Chordal 4-cycle): 5 - 8 - 2 - 0 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 1 - 4 - 5 has no chords.
- Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 7 - 9 - 5 has no chords.
- Cycle 3: 5 - 3 - 1 - 4 - 5 has no chords.
- Cycle 4: 5 - 8 - 2 - 0 - 5 has one chord: (5, 2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 3 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, (8, 0), 2>.
