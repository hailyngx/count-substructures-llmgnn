The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 10) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-11-3-1-4
- Cycle 2: 4-7-11-8-2-4
- Cycle 3: 4-13-12-5-2-4
- Cycle 4: 4-2-9-0-6-4
- Cycle 5: 4-12-0-6-7-4
- Cycle 6: 7-6-0-3-11-7
- Cycle 7: 7-6-8-2-1-7
- Cycle 8: 1-3-5-2-4-1
- Cycle 9: 3-0-12-5-2-3
- Cycle 10: 3-11-8-6-7-3 
- Cycle 11: 1-13-12-0-3-1
- Cycle 12: 2-9-0-12-13-2
- Cycle 13: 2-10-14-8-11-2
- Cycle 14: 9-0-12-13-10-9
- Cycle 15: 5-2-9-4-13-5
- Cycle 16: 5-10-7-6-0-5
- Cycle 17: 14-10-13-4-9-14

Step 2:  
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (3, 11)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (7, 3)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (5, 12)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (9, 0)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (0, 3)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (2, 4)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (3, 2)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (12, 13)
- Cycle 13 has one chord: (11, 14)
- Cycle 14 has one chord: (0, 9)
- Cycle 15 has one chord: (2, 9)
- Cycle 16 has one chord: (10, 7)
- Cycle 17 has one chord: (4, 13)

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:  
There are 17 cycles with exactly one chord present.

Therefore, the final count is [17].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <4, 7, 11, 3>
- <2, 7, 11, 8>
- <4, 13, 12, 5>
- <4, 2, 9, 0>
- <4, 12, 0, 6>
- <7, 6, 0, 3>
- <7, 6, 8, 2>
- <1, 3, 5, 2>
- <3, 0, 12, 5>
- <3, 11, 8, 6>
- <1, 13, 12, 0>
- <2, 9, 0, 12>
- <2, 10, 14, 8>
- <9, 0, 12, 13>
- <5, 2, 9, 4>
- <5, 10, 7, 6>
- <14, 10, 13, 4>
