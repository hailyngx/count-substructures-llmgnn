Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 10) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 3) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (7, 5) (7, 16) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 19) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 9) (3, 18) (19, 10) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 2) (2, 19) (18, 14) (18, 3) (18, 11) (13, 15) (13, 0) (11, 5) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle (4, 5, 6, 1)
2. Cycle (4, 5, 11, 15)
3. Cycle (8, 3, 12, 0)
4. Cycle (8, 10, 6, 5)
5. Cycle (8, 10, 15, 13)
6. Cycle (5, 11, 18, 3)
7. Cycle (14, 18, 3, 8)
8. Cycle (14, 18, 11, 5)
9. Cycle (5, 6, 10, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

From the list above, the cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle (5, 6, 10, 15), which has chord (6, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <5, 6, 10, 15> with chord (6, 10).
