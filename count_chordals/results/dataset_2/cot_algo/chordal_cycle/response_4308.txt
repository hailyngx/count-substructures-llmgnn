Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-3-6-1-5
- Cycle 3: 5-3-1-6-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-6-3-5
- Cycle 5: 5-7-3-1-5
- Cycle 6: 5-7-4-6-5
- Cycle 7: 5-7-3-6-5
- Cycle 8: 5-7-4-6-1-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (6, 1)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (3, 6)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (6, 3)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (3, 1)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (4, 3)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (6, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:

There are [8] unique chordal 4-cycles found.

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (6, 1), 5>
<2, (3, 6), 5>
<3, (1, 6), 5>
<4, (6, 3), 5>
<5, (3, 1), 5>
<6, (7, 6), 5>
<7, (4, 3), 5>
<8, (6, 1), (7, 4)>
