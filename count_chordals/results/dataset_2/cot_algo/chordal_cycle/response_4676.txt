Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 0)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 7, 6)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 2, 3)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 6, 1)
- Cycle 5: (9, 7, 6, 1)
- Cycle 6: (4, 1, 8, 6)
- Cycle 7: (4, 3, 2, 7)
- Cycle 8: (4, 3, 0, 1)
- Cycle 9: (4, 0, 1, 8)
- Cycle 10: (7, 6, 1, 0)
- Cycle 11: (7, 6, 2, 3)
- Cycle 12: (7, 2, 3, 0)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord that connects vertices 9 and 0.
- Cycle 2 has a chord that connects vertices 9 and 6.
- Cycle 4 has a chord that connects vertices 7 and 6.
- Cycle 8 has a chord that connects vertices 0 and 3.
- Cycle 9 has a chord that connects vertices 4 and 1.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 7 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (9, 0), 4>
<2, (9, 6), 4>
<4, (7, 6), 6>
<10, (9, 1), 6>
<7, (0, 3), 4>
<8, (1, 4), 3>
<9, (4, 0), 6>
