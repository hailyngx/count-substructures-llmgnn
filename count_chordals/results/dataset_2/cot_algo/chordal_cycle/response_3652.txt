Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 19) (6, 5) (6, 10) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 2) (17, 7) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 12) (16, 7) (16, 1) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 8) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (12, 13) (12, 16) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 8) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 2) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 7) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 14) (2, 19) (4, 3) (4, 9) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4:
- (3, 4, 9, 19)
- (3, 10, 0, 18)
- (3, 15, 13, 12)
- (15, 19, 9, 4)
- (5, 6, 10, 0)
- (5, 11, 14, 8)
- (6, 10, 0, 18)
- (13, 15, 19, 9)
- (13, 12, 16, 1)
- (13, 2, 17, 7)
- (13, 18, 0, 10)
- (17, 2, 14, 8)
- (0, 10, 6, 5)
- (0, 18, 13, 15)
- (0, 1, 16, 12)
- (16, 12, 13, 15)
- (16, 7, 17, 2)
- (1, 0, 10, 6)
- (1, 16, 12, 13)
- (10, 6, 5, 11)
- (10, 18, 0, 1)
- (11, 5, 6, 10)
- (11, 14, 8, 7)
- (14, 5, 11, 14)
- (14, 8, 1, 0)
- (12, 13, 15, 19)
- (7, 17, 2, 13)
- (7, 16, 12, 13)
- (19, 15, 13, 12)
- (8, 14, 2, 17)

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <3, (4, 9), 19>
- <3, (10, 0), 18>
- <3, (15, 13), 12>
- <15, (19, 9), 4>
- <5, (6, 10), 0>
- <5, (11, 14), 8>
- <6, (10, 0), 18>
- <13, (15, 19), 9>
- <13, (12, 16), 1>
- <13, (2, 17), 7>
- <13, (18, 0), 10>
- <17, (2, 14), 8>
- <0, (10, 6), 5>
- <0, (18, 13), 15>
- <0, (1, 16), 12>
- <16, (12, 13), 15>
- <16, (7, 17), 2>
- <1, (0, 10), 6>
- <1, (16, 12), 13>
- <10, (6, 5), 11>
- <10, (18, 0), 1>
- <11, (5, 6), 10>
- <11, (14, 8), 7>
- <14, (5, 11), 14>
- <14, (8, 1), 0>
- <12, (13, 15), 19>
- <7, (17, 2), 13>
- <7, (16, 12), 13>
- <19, (15, 13), 12>
- <8, (14, 2), 17>

Step 3:
Finally, there are [29] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
