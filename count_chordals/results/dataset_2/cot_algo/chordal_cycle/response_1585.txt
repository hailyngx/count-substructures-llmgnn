Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-2-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-7-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-8-9-0
- Cycle 4: 1-6-3-2-1
- Cycle 5: 4-5-9-7-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Checking Cycle 1: 0-1-2-3-0 (no chord)
- Checking Cycle 2: 0-4-7-1-0 (chord: 4-1)
- Checking Cycle 3: 0-5-8-9-0 (chord: 5-8)
- Checking Cycle 4: 1-6-3-2-1 (no chord)
- Checking Cycle 5: 4-5-9-7-4 (chord: 9-4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 1, 4, 7> (chord: 4-1)
<0, 5, 8, 9> (chord: 5-8)
