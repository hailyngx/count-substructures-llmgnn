Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 1, 3, 8, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 13, 11, 0, 7, 14, 1, 6)
- Cycle 4: (9, 2, 14, 7, 0, 11, 13, 9)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 14, 7, 0, 11, 13, 1)
- Cycle 6: (2, 9, 12, 4, 5, 2)
- Cycle 7: (8, 3, 11, 0, 10, 8)
- Cycle 8: (11, 1, 14, 7, 0, 10, 13, 11)
- Cycle 9: (0, 11, 13, 10, 8, 3, 1, 0)
- Cycle 10: (7, 0, 4, 12, 9, 6, 1, 7)
- Cycle 11: (4, 12, 9, 2, 14, 5, 11, 4)
- Cycle 12: (10, 0, 4, 5, 8, 10)
- Cycle 13: (5, 14, 7, 0, 10, 8, 3, 5)
- Cycle 14: (14, 1, 6, 8, 10, 14)
- Cycle 15: (13, 6, 9, 12, 4, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (6, 1)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (2, 11)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (3, 1)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (11, 3)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (10, 1)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (0, 8)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (7, 1)
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (12, 9)
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: (5, 4)
- Cycle 13 has 1 chord: (14, 3)
- Cycle 14 has 1 chord: (6, 10)
- Cycle 15 has 1 chord: (9, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 15 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
- <6, 1, 3, 8, (2, 8)>
- <9, 2, 5, 8, (2, 11)>
- <1, 3, 14, 7, (3, 1)>
- <6, 13, 11, 0, 7, 14, 1, (6, 1)>
- <10, 0, 4, 5, 8, (5, 4)>
- <12, 9, 4, 6, 1, (9, 4)>
- <3, 11, 0, 10, 8, (11, 3)>
- <7, 0, 4, 12, 9, 6, 1, (7, 1)>
- <2, 9, 12, 4, 5, 2, (12, 9)>
- <5, 14, 7, 0, 10, 8, 3, (14, 3)>
- <11, 1, 14, 7, 0, 10, 13, (10, 1)>
- <0, 11, 13, 10, 8, 3, 1, (0, 8)>
- <14, 1, 6, 8, 10, 14, (6, 10)>
- <13, 6, 9, 12, 4, 13, (9, 12)>
