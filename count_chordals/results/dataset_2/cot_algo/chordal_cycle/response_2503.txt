Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

There are 21 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [21].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found are:
- <4, 2, 12, 8> with chord (8, 5)
- <4, 14, 0, 1> with chord (0, 1)
- <4, 14, 6, 13> with chord (6, 13)
- <4, 10, 12, 11> with chord (12, 11)
- <7, 5, 8, 12> with chord (5, 8)
- <13, 1, 0, 14> with chord (1, 0)
- <5, 13, 6, 14> with chord (13, 6)
