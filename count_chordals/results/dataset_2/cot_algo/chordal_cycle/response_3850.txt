Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 15) (15, 16) (15, 27) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 28) (27, 5) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 23) (7, 22) (18, 26) (18, 12) (22, 7) (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 21) (8, 0) (23, 7) (23, 8) (19, 16) (19, 6) (26, 18) (26, 13) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 24) (1, 20) (1, 25) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (20, 1) (20, 17) (20, 10) (10, 20) (10, 21) (10, 2) (21, 8) (21, 10) (21, 25) (21, 29) (2, 16) (2, 27) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 27) (5, 17) (5, 2) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 6) (25, 4) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 24) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 28) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 3) (6, 14) (24, 9) (24, 17) (24, 3) (24, 25) (12, 18) (13, 26) (13, 0) (13, 29) (29, 21) (29, 13) (28, 27) (28, 4) (28, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<16, 2, 27, 15, 16>
<16, 19, 6, 7, 4, 28, 15, 16>
<7, 6, 19, 16, 15, 14, 28, 4, 7>
<8, 23, 7, 6, 3, 24, 9, 8>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <16, 2, 27, 15, 16> has a chord: (2, 15)
- <16, 19, 6, 7, 4, 28, 15, 16> has a chord: (19, 4)
- <7, 6, 19, 16, 15, 14, 28, 4, 7> has a chord: (19, 14)
- <8, 23, 7, 6, 3, 24, 9, 8> has a chord: (6, 24)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
