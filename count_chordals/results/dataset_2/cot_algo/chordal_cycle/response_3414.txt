Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 6) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 10, 13, 11, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 11, 13, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 12, 6, 3, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 8, 10, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 2, 1, 4, 13, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 10, 3, 0, 12, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 13, 11, 7, 12, 9)
- Cycle 10: (4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 13, 11, 7, 0, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 10, 3, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 13: (7, 11, 13, 6, 12, 7)
- Cycle 14: (10, 3, 6, 13, 11, 10)
- Cycle 15: (8, 10, 3, 6, 12, 8)
- Cycle 16: (1, 2, 3, 6, 13, 1)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (5, 9), 4>
- <2, (5, 9), 13>
- <3, (5, 7), 11>
- <4, (5, 4), 1>
- <5, (5, 7), 12>
- <6, (5, 8), 10>
- <7, (9, 13), 4>
- <8, (9, 10), 12>
- <9, (9, 13), 11>
- <10, (4, 1), 2>
- <11, (4, 13), 0>
- <12, (4, 10), 6>
- <13, (7, 11), 13>
- <14, (10, 3), 6>
- <15, (8, 10), 3>
- <16, (1, 2), 13>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [16]
