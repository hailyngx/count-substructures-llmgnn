Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 1)

85. (1, 9, 14, 4, 1)
86. (1, 0, 7, 12, 1)
87. (1, 0, 7, 0, 1)

Next, we will check each cycle for exactly one chord (connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (9, 1), 2>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (9, 14), 4>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <12, (7, 0), 1>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <4, (8, 2), 10>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <8, (2, 11), 4>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, (7, 12), 1>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <7, (12, 14), 0>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, (8, 11), 3>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <13, (4, 8), 14>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, (1, 5), 14>

Finally, we count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 87 - 10 = 77. 

Therefore, the final number to be put inside brackets is [77].
