Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 7) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 8) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 3) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 5-11-7-10-6-9-12-5
- Cycle 2: 5-11-7-12-9-6-10-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<5, 11, 7, 10, 6, 9, 12, 5> with chord (5, 9)
<5, 11, 7, 12, 9, 6, 10, 5> with chord (5, 12)
