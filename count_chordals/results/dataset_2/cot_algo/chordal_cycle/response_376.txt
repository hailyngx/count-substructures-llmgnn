Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 12, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (1, 7, 12, 1)
- Cycle 3: (3, 0, 11, 6, 3)
- Cycle 4: (4, 5, 9, 10, 4)
- Cycle 5: (8, 9, 10, 2, 8)
- Cycle 6: (14, 3, 0, 11, 14)
- Cycle 7: (6, 11, 14, 6)
- Cycle 8: (2, 5, 9, 10, 2)
- Cycle 9: (13, 6, 11, 14, 13)
- Cycle 10: (7, 12, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 11: (4, 9, 10, 2, 13, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<4, 9, 10, 2, 13>, with chord (4, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 10 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
