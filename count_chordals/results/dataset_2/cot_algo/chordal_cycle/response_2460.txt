Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 4 - 11 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 7 - 14 - 0 - 6
- Cycle 3: 9 - 4 - 8 - 13 - 9
- Cycle 4: 9 - 7 - 1 - 11 - 9
- Cycle 5: 6 - 3 - 13 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 6: 6 - 5 - 1 - 0 - 6
- Cycle 7: 7 - 1 - 0 - 14 - 7
- Cycle 8: 4 - 11 - 13 - 5 - 4

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <Cycle 1, (9, 11)>
- <Cycle 2, (7, 14)>
- <Cycle 3, (4, 8)>
- <Cycle 4, (7, 1)>
- <Cycle 5, (3, 13)>
- <Cycle 6, (5, 1)>
- <Cycle 7, (0, 14)>
- <Cycle 8, (11, 13)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, there are [8] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
