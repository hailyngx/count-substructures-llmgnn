Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 18) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 18) (2, 17) (2, 5) (8, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 7) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 18) (9, 8) (9, 12) (15, 6) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 6) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (18, 1) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 16) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- <1, 4, 7, 1>
- <1, 4, 12, 5, 1>
- <1, 4, 3, 6, 16, 18, 1>
- <1, 5, 7, 4, 1>
- <1, 5, 2, 17, 11, 19, 1>
- <1, 5, 12, 9, 8, 9, 12, 5>
- <1, 18, 17, 11, 19, 5, 12, 9, 12, 4, 1>
- <3, 4, 12, 5, 2, 17, 11, 19, 7, 4, 3>
- <3, 4, 7, 5, 2, 17, 11, 19, 5, 12, 3>
- <3, 13, 0, 10, 11, 17, 18, 16, 6, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, 4, 7, 1> has 1 chord: (4, 7)
- <1, 4, 12, 5, 1> has 1 chord: (4, 5)
- <1, 5, 7, 4, 1> has 1 chord: (5, 4)
- <3, 13, 0, 10, 11, 17, 18, 16, 6, 3> has 1 chord: (10, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 0 chordless cycles found.

The final count of chordal 4-cycles is [0].
