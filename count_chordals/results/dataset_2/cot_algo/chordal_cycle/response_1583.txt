Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 3) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 15) (15, 10) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 2) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 0) (6, 4) (6, 19) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 19) (2, 0) (2, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 5, 7, 1>
- <0, 5, 17, 18>
- <0, 5, 8, 16>
- <0, 7, 15, 10>
- <0, 7, 1, 5>
- <1, 5, 8, 16>
- <1, 5, 0, 7>
- <1, 5, 17, 18>
- <2, 0, 7, 15>
- <2, 16, 8, 5>
- <3, 13, 11, 19>
- <3, 13, 16, 2>
- <3, 13, 16, 8>
- <3, 13, 18, 17>
- <3, 18, 17, 5>
- <3, 18, 4, 10>
- <3, 18, 14, 19>
- <4, 10, 15, 17>
- <4, 10, 11, 8>
- <4, 6, 19, 14>
- <4, 6, 18, 17>
- <5, 8, 16, 2>
- <5, 8, 12, 17>
- <5, 8, 12, 17>
- <5, 17, 18, 14>
- <6, 4, 10, 15>
- <6, 19, 14, 15>
- <7, 1, 5, 17>
- <7, 15, 14, 19>
- <8, 16, 2, 0>
- <8, 16, 13, 3>
- <10, 15, 14, 19>
- <11, 13, 16, 2>
- <11, 19, 14, 18>
- <13, 16, 2, 0>
- <13, 16, 8, 5>
- <13, 18, 17, 5>
- <13, 18, 4, 10>
- <14, 18, 17, 5>
- <14, 18, 3, 13>
- <14, 19, 6, 4>
- <14, 19, 11, 13>
- <15, 10, 4, 6>
- <15, 10, 11, 13>
- <15, 14, 18, 17>
- <15, 17, 5, 0>
- <16, 8, 5, 17>
- <16, 8, 12, 17>
- <17, 5, 0, 2>
- <17, 12, 8, 5>
- <17, 12, 8, 5>
- <18, 4, 6, 19>
- <18, 4, 10, 11>
- <18, 3, 13, 11>
- <18, 3, 0, 7>
- <19, 14, 18, 3>
- <19, 14, 15, 10>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 5, 8, (16, 2)>
- <1, 5, 17, (18, 7)>
- <3, 13, 11, (19, 16)>
- <4, 10, 15, (17, 6)>
- <8, 5, 17, (12, 16)>
- <13, 16, 2, (8, 0)>

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
