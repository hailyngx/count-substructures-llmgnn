Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 1) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (4, 8) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 19) (5, 11) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 14) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 11) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 2) (15, 4) (15, 14) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 15) (3, 4) (3, 16) (3, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 10, 6, 2, 7, 18, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 2, 6, 10, 17, 13, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 2, 14, 18, 7, 2, 6, 10, 17, 13, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 13, 17, 9, 11, 19, 12, 0)
- Cycle 5: (3, 4, 8, 18, 0, 16, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 4, 15, 14, 2, 6, 10, 17, 9, 11, 19, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 16, 9, 11, 13, 17, 16, 3)
- Cycle 8: (7, 2, 1, 0, 13, 11, 5, 7)
- Cycle 9: (11, 5, 7, 18, 14, 2, 6, 10, 17, 16, 3, 4, 15, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <0, 1, 10, 17, 13, 0> has a chord (1, 13) 
- <0, 1, 2, 6, 10, 17, 13, 0> has a chord (1, 13)
- <0, 1, 2, 14, 18, 7, 2, 6, 10, 17, 13, 0> has a chord (1, 13)
- <0, 13, 17, 9, 11, 19, 12, 0> has a chord (9, 17)
- <3, 4, 8, 18, 0, 16, 3> has a chord (4, 16)
- <3, 4, 15, 14, 2, 6, 10, 17, 9, 11, 19, 3> has a chord (4, 16)
- <7, 2, 1, 0, 13, 11, 5, 7> has a chord (1, 11)
- <11, 5, 7, 18, 14, 2, 6, 10, 17, 16, 3, 4, 15, 11> has a chord (5, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are [0] chordless 4-cycles found in the given graph.
