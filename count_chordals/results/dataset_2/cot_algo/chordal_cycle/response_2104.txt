Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 3) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 10) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 4) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 2) (1, 8) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 1) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 10) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 12) (4, 0) (4, 16) (12, 10) (12, 16) (7, 9) (7, 16) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 7) (16, 2) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 11) (2, 14) (2, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 3, 15, 10)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 14, 6)
- Cycle 3: (5, 19, 8, 17)
- Cycle 4: (5, 15, 9, 7)
- Cycle 5: (9, 10, 1, 17)
- Cycle 6: (9, 15, 3, 17)
- Cycle 7: (3, 15, 10, 1)
- Cycle 8: (3, 15, 9, 7)
- Cycle 9: (15, 10, 1, 8)
- Cycle 10: (8, 13, 0, 4)
- Cycle 11: (8, 13, 0, 16)
- Cycle 12: (8, 19, 11, 6)
- Cycle 13: (13, 0, 4, 16)
- Cycle 14: (0, 4, 16, 2)
- Cycle 15: (14, 3, 6, 11)
- Cycle 16: (14, 3, 17, 1)
- Cycle 17: (14, 6, 11, 1)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- <1, (5, 3), 10>
- <2, (5, 14), 6>
- <3, (5, 8), 17>
- <4, (5, 9), 7>
- <5, (10, 1), 17>
- <6, (9, 15), 17>
- <7, (3, 10), 1>
- <8, (3, 9), 7>
- <9, (10, 1), 8>
- <10, (8, 0), 4>
- <11, (8, 0), 16>
- <12, (8, 11), 19>
- <13, (13, 0), 16>
- <14, (0, 16), 2>
- <15, (6, 3), 11>
- <16, (3, 17), 1>
- <17, (6, 11), 14>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [17].
