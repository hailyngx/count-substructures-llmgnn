Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 7 - 8 - 6 - 5 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (0, 7)
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

List of unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, (0, 7), 6, 5)>
<1, 8, 9, 3, 0)>
