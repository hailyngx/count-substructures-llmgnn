Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-7-5-6-1-9-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-9-1-6-5-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-9-8-3-1-6-5-7-0
- Cycle 4: 0-3-9-8-5-7-4-0
- Cycle 5: 0-3-9-1-6-5-7-4-0
- Cycle 6: 1-9-8-5-7-4-0-3-1
- Cycle 7: 1-9-8-3-0-4-7-5-6-1
- Cycle 8: 1-3-0-4-7-5-6-1
- Cycle 9: 1-3-0-2-5-7-4-9-1
- Cycle 10: 1-6-5-7-2-0-3-1
- Cycle 11: 2-9-8-5-6-1-3-0-2
- Cycle 12: 2-9-8-3-0-4-7-5-6-2
- Cycle 13: 2-0-3-1-6-5-7-4-9-2

Step 2:
List of cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (4, 7), 5, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (4, 9), 1, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (3, 9), 8, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, (3, 9), 1, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (9, 8), 5, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (9, 8), 3, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, (3, 0), 4, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, (3, 0), 2, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <2, (9, 8), 5, 6>

Step 3: 
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [9].
