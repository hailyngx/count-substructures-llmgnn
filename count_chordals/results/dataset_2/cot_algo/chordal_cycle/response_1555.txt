Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 6) (16, 10) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 8) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 15) (5, 13) (5, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 2) (0, 16) (0, 8) (9, 7) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 6) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 4) (19, 3) (19, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (6, 16) (6, 18) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 6, 0, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 16, 10, 8, 11)
- Cycle 3: (11, 12, 7, 1, 11)
- Cycle 4: (11, 14, 17, 3, 11)
- Cycle 5: (11, 14, 4, 2, 11)
- Cycle 6: (16, 0, 8, 10, 16)
- Cycle 7: (16, 6, 18, 5, 16)
- Cycle 8: (14, 4, 3, 17, 14)
- Cycle 9: (7, 1, 17, 3, 7)
- Cycle 10: (7, 12, 15, 18, 7)
- Cycle 11: (5, 13, 19, 3, 5)
- Cycle 12: (13, 19, 3, 1, 13)
- Cycle 13: (15, 2, 4, 14, 15)
- Cycle 14: (9, 7, 1, 3, 9)
- Cycle 15: (16, 10, 8, 0, 16)
- Cycle 16: (18, 6, 16, 10, 18)
- Cycle 17: (15, 18, 6, 16, 15)
- Cycle 18: (14, 17, 1, 7, 14)

Step 2: Checking for a single chord in each cycle:

- Cycle 1: <1, (16, 0), 11>
- Cycle 2: <2, (11, 10), 8>
- Cycle 3: <3, (1, 11), 7>
- Cycle 4: <4, (3, 11), 14>
- Cycle 5: <5, (4, 11), 14>
- Cycle 6: <6, (8, 16), 0>
- Cycle 7: <7, (5, 16), 18>
- Cycle 8: <8, (3, 14), 4>
- Cycle 9: <9, (7, 17), 1>
- Cycle 10: <10, (12, 7), 15>
- Cycle 11: <11, (5, 13), 19>
- Cycle 12: <12, (13, 3), 1>
- Cycle 13: <13, (4, 14), 2>
- Cycle 14: <14, (3, 7), 9>
- Cycle 15: <15, (8, 16), 0>
- Cycle 16: <16, (18, 10), 6>
- Cycle 17: <17, (15, 16), 18>
- Cycle 18: <18, (7, 1), 17>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:

There are 18 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [18].
