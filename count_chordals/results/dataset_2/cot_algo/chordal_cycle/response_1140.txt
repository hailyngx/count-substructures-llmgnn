Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 2-9-6-8-2
- Cycle 2: 2-9-7-4-2
- Cycle 3: 2-9-7-11-2
- Cycle 4: 2-9-7-13-2
- Cycle 5: 2-9-10-6-2
- Cycle 6: 2-9-10-3-2
- Cycle 7: 2-9-10-4-2
- Cycle 8: 2-9-10-13-2
- Cycle 9: 2-9-6-14-2
- Cycle 10: 2-9-6-10-2
- Cycle 11: 2-7-9-6-2
- Cycle 12: 2-7-9-10-2
- Cycle 13: 2-7-4-11-2
- Cycle 14: 2-7-4-10-2
- Cycle 15: 2-7-4-12-2
- Cycle 16: 2-7-13-10-2
- Cycle 17: 2-7-13-1-2
- Cycle 18: 2-7-13-0-2
- Cycle 19: 2-4-7-9-2
- Cycle 20: 2-4-10-9-2
- Cycle 21: 2-4-10-6-2
- Cycle 22: 2-4-11-7-2
- Cycle 23: 2-4-11-12-2
- Cycle 24: 2-4-11-5-2
- Cycle 25: 2-4-12-11-2
- Cycle 26: 2-4-12-5-2
- Cycle 27: 2-14-6-10-2
- Cycle 28: 2-14-6-8-2
- Cycle 29: 2-14-3-10-2
- Cycle 30: 2-14-3-5-2
- Cycle 31: 2-14-5-7-2
- Cycle 32: 2-14-5-12-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <2, (9, 6), 8, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (7, 4), 11, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, (7, 9), 10, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (7, 13), 10, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, (4, 10), 9, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <2, (14, 6), 10, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <2, (14, 3), 5, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 32 cycles listed, and 7 of them are chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [25].
