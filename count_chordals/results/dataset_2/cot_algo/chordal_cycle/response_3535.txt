Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 16) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 11) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 18) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 14) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 12) (10, 16) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 19) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 16) (12, 15) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 19) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (4, 7, 3, 2, 6, 4)
- (6, 2, 3, 7, 11, 6)
- (7, 3, 2, 6, 11, 7)
- (13, 9, 14, 18, 11, 13)
- (15, 1, 18, 14, 12, 15)
- (17, 13, 14, 12, 15, 17)
- (19, 17, 16, 8, 14, 19)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
- <1, (15, 12), 18> with chord (15, 12)
- <2, (6, 11), 3> with chord (6, 11)
- <3, (7, 11), 2> with chord (7, 11)
- <4, (6, 2), 7> with chord (6, 2)
- <6, (2, 3), 7> with chord (2, 3)
- <9, (14, 18), 13> with chord (14, 18)
- <13, (9, 17), 14> with chord (9, 17)
- <17, (13, 14), 15> with chord (13, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- So, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
