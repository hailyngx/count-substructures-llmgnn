Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 4) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 1) (13, 17) (13, 4) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (18, 19) (18, 7) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 1) (0, 15) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 5) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 12) (1, 8) (1, 19) (11, 7) (11, 9) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 6) (7, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 14) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 5) (16, 8) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (3, 6, 17, 2)
- Cycle 2: (3, 6, 12, 14)
- Cycle 3: (3, 6, 7, 17)
- Cycle 4: (3, 19, 18, 7)
- Cycle 5: (15, 0, 2, 17)
- Cycle 6: (15, 0, 10, 5)
- Cycle 7: (15, 4, 13, 17)
- Cycle 8: (15, 4, 14, 3)
- Cycle 9: (2, 0, 10, 5)
- Cycle 10: (2, 8, 1, 19)
- Cycle 11: (8, 2, 17, 13)
- Cycle 12: (8, 16, 5, 10)
- Cycle 13: (13, 17, 6, 3)
- Cycle 14: (17, 13, 4, 14)
- Cycle 15: (17, 6, 12, 14)
- Cycle 16: (17, 7, 11, 9)
- Cycle 17: (18, 7, 6, 3)
- Cycle 18: (19, 3, 6, 17)
- Cycle 19: (19, 1, 8, 2)
- Cycle 20: (0, 15, 4, 14)
- Cycle 21: (0, 10, 5, 15)
- Cycle 22: (10, 0, 2, 17)
- Cycle 23: (6, 3, 19, 18)
- Cycle 24: (6, 12, 5, 10)
- Cycle 25: (7, 17, 13, 4)
- Cycle 26: (7, 6, 3, 19)
- Cycle 27: (7, 11, 9, 12)
- Cycle 28: (14, 3, 19, 18)
- Cycle 29: (14, 12, 6, 3)
- Cycle 30: (4, 15, 0, 10)
- Cycle 31: (5, 10, 0, 15)
- Cycle 32: (5, 17, 13, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (2, 17), 13>
- <2, (17, 6), 3>
- <3, (6, 12), 14>
- <3, (19, 18), 7>
- <4, (14, 12), 6>
- <5, (15, 0), 10>
- <7, (17, 13), 4>
- <7, (11, 9), 12>
- <8, (1, 19), 15>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
