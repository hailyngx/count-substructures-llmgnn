Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 9) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 6) (4, 16) (4, 10) (9, 17) (9, 12) (9, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 12, 2, 0> with edges (0, 7), (7, 12), (12, 2), (2, 0)
- Cycle 2: <1, 0, 7, 12, 1> with edges (1, 0), (0, 7), (7, 12), (12, 1)
- Cycle 3: <1, 0, 16, 8, 1> with edges (1, 0), (0, 16), (16, 8), (8, 1)
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 2, 10, 1> with edges (1, 6), (6, 2), (2, 10), (10, 1)
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 11, 14, 1> with edges (1, 6), (6, 11), (11, 14), (14, 1)
- Cycle 6: <1, 18, 3, 13, 1> with edges (1, 18), (18, 3), (3, 13), (13, 1)
- Cycle 7: <4, 10, 2, 6, 4> with edges (4, 10), (10, 2), (2, 6), (6, 4)
- Cycle 8: <11, 6, 2, 10, 11> with edges (11, 6), (6, 2), (2, 10), (10, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Only Cycle 3: <1, 0, 16, 8, 1> has exactly one chord (0, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordless cycles = [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (0, 8), 16>
