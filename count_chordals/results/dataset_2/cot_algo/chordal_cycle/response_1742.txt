Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 14) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <4, 5, 6, 3>
- <4, 5, 8, 1>
- <4, 14, 13, 1>
- <4, 3, 12, 13>
- <7, 2, 12, 0>
- <6, 5, 0, 1>
- <6, 3, 12, 13>
- <9, 8, 1, 13>
- <9, 11, 1, 13>
- <8, 11, 1, 13>
- <12, 13, 1, 0>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, 5, 6, 3> has chord (5, 3)
- <4, 5, 8, 1> has chord (5, 1)
- <4, 14, 13, 1> has chord (14, 1)
- <4, 3, 12, 13> has chord (3, 12)
- <7, 2, 12, 0> has chord (7, 12)
- <6, 5, 0, 1> has chord (5, 1)
- <6, 3, 12, 13> has chord (3, 12)
- <9, 8, 1, 13> has chord (8, 13)
- <9, 11, 1, 13> has chord (11, 13)
- <8, 11, 1, 13> has chord (11, 13)
- <12, 13, 1, 0> has chord (13, 0)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordless cycles is [11].
