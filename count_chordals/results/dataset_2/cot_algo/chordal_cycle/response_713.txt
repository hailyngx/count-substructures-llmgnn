Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2: 
- No chordal 4-cycles can be found since there are no cycles of length 4 or more.

Step 3:
- Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
