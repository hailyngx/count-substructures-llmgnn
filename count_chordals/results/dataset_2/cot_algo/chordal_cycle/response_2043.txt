Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (1, 9, 0, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 9, 2, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 9, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 6, 4, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 7, 6, 1)
- Cycle 6: (2, 9, 0, 5, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 9, 1, 3, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 9, 8, 5, 2)
- Cycle 9: (3, 1, 8, 6, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 6, 4, 1, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle 12: (4, 1, 9, 2, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 1, 3, 6, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 2, 9, 1, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 2, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 16: (5, 0, 9, 2, 5)
- Cycle 17: (5, 1, 9, 8, 5)
- Cycle 18: (6, 3, 1, 9, 6)
- Cycle 19: (6, 3, 4, 2, 6)
- Cycle 20: (6, 4, 1, 9, 6)
- Cycle 21: (7, 3, 1, 9, 7)
- Cycle 22: (7, 3, 6, 4, 7)
- Cycle 23: (8, 5, 1, 9, 8)
- Cycle 24: (8, 6, 3, 1, 8)
- Cycle 25: (8, 6, 4, 2, 8)
- Cycle 26: (8, 7, 3, 6, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (5, 8), 9, 0, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (2, 4), 9, 1, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (5, 8), 9, 8, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (3, 7), 6, 4, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (3, 7), 6, 3, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <2, (5, 0), 9, 2, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <2, (1, 3), 9, 8, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <3, (1, 8), 6, 4, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (1, 9), 2, 4, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <4, (2, 6), 1, 9, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [10].
