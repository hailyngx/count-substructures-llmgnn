Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-8-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-4-0-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (8, 6) connecting non-adjacent nodes 8 and 6.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (5, 0) connecting non-adjacent nodes 5 and 0.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (8, 6), 5, 1>
- <1, (5, 0), 4, 1>
