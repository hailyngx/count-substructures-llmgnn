Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
<5, 9, 8, 5>
<3, 9, 8, 3>
<5, 2, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 2, 4>
<9, 5, 7, 6>
<2, 5, 8, 3>
<0, 3, 4, 2>
<9, 4, 0, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<5, 9, (8), 5>
<3, 9, (8), 3>
<5, 2, (4), 9>
<0, 5, (2), 4>
<9, 5, (7), 6>
<2, 5, (8), 3>
<0, 3, (4), 2>
<9, 4, (0), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are a total of [0] chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
