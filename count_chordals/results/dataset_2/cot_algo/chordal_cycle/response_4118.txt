Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 6, 4>
2. Cycle <4, 7, 5, 8>
3. Cycle <9, 5, 4, 1>
4. Cycle <1, 0, 6, 9>
5. Cycle <6, 3, 2, 5>
6. Cycle <8, 0, 6, 4>
7. Cycle <2, 5, 8, 3>

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycle is:
- <5, 9, 6, 4> with chord (9, 6)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [6].
