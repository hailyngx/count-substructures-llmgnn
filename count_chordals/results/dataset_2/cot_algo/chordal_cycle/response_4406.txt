Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (7, 12, 11, 7)
- Cycle 2: (7, 12, 0, 7)
- Cycle 3: (7, 12, 14, 7)
- Cycle 4: (7, 12, 11, 8, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 12, 0, 2, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 12, 14, 5, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 12, 14, 6, 7)
- Cycle 8: (7, 12, 11, 4, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 12, 14, 4, 7)
- Cycle 10: (7, 12, 0, 14, 7)
- Cycle 11: (7, 12, 0, 2, 1, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 12, 11, 8, 5, 7)
- Cycle 13: (7, 12, 14, 5, 6, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 12, 14, 5, 13, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 12, 14, 6, 10, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 12, 14, 4, 11, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 4 has a chord: (11, 8)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (14, 4)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (2, 1)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (8, 5)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (6, 5)
- Cycle 14 has a chord: (13, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- Chordless cycles: [10]

Unique Chordal 4-cycles:
- <7, 12, 11, 7>
- <7, 12, 0, 7>
- <7, 12, 14, 7>
- <7, 12, 14, 6, 7>
- <7, 12, 11, 4, 7>
- <7, 12, 0, 2, 7>
- <7, 12, 14, 5, 7>
- <7, 12, 0, 14, 7>
- <7, 12, 14, 5, 6, 7>
- <7, 12, 14, 5, 13, 7>
