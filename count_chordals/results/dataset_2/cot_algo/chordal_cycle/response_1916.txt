Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 3) (2, 13) (2, 25) (29, 15) (29, 24) (8, 23) (8, 7) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 19) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 25) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 16) (5, 23) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 4) (5, 20) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 7) (10, 28) (22, 14) (22, 26) (22, 11) (22, 20) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 25) (21, 14) (21, 27) (21, 6) (21, 26) (18, 26) (18, 20) (15, 29) (15, 16) (15, 24) (16, 27) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 19) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (25, 17) (25, 2) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 13) (9, 24) (9, 3) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 9) (11, 22) (11, 0) (19, 23) (19, 16) (19, 0) (7, 8) (7, 6) (20, 5) (20, 22) (20, 18) (0, 11) (0, 19) (28, 27) (28, 10) (28, 24) (24, 29) (24, 15) (24, 9) (24, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (13, 2, 25, 17, 14)
- Cycle 2: (5, 25, 13, 12, 4)
- Cycle 3: (6, 21, 26, 22, 14)
- Cycle 4: (16, 27, 21, 14, 17)
- Cycle 5: (16, 27, 21, 6, 1)
- Cycle 6: (16, 27, 28, 10, 28)
- Cycle 7: (24, 9, 3, 17, 14)
- Cycle 8: (24, 9, 3, 4, 12)
- Cycle 9: (24, 9, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 10: (24, 9, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 11: (24, 9, 3, 4, 12)
- Cycle 12: (24, 9, 3, 4, 12)
- Cycle 13: (24, 9, 3, 4, 12)
- Cycle 14: (24, 9, 3, 4, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (14, 17), 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (5, 12), 25)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (14, 22), 21)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (16, 27), 21)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (9, 24), 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (16, 27), 21)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [6].
