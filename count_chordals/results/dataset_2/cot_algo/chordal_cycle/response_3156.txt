Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (12, 3) (12, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 0, 8, 1, 3, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (11, 0, 8, 1, 3, 7, 4, 11)
- Cycle 3: (14, 11, 0, 8, 4, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (0, 4)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (11, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- As we found 3 unique chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 9, 0, 8>
<11, 0, 4, 14>
<14, 11, 8, 4>
