Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 7, 9, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (6, 4, 5, 7, 6)
- Cycle 3: (2, 7, 8, 9, 2)
- Cycle 4: (0, 3, 6, 4, 0)
- Cycle 5: (1, 0, 3, 2, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (7, 9).
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (5, 7).
- Cycle 3 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (2, 8).
- Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (3, 4).
- Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (0, 3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 0 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <5, 7, 9, 8, (7, 9)>
2. <6, 4, 5, 7, (5, 7)>
3. <2, 7, 8, 9, (2, 8)>
4. <0, 3, 6, 4, (3, 4)>
5. <1, 0, 3, 2, (0, 3)>
