Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 11) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-2-13-3-4-12-9-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-2-14-3-13-12-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-8-7-12-9-11-1-14-3-13-6-7-0
- Cycle 4: 0-8-7-14-2-5-11-1-3-13-6-7-0
- Cycle 5: 0-8-1-11-2-14-7-12-9-0
- Cycle 6: 0-9-11-2-5-13-12-7-8-0
- Cycle 7: 0-9-12-7-14-2-11-1-8-0
- Cycle 8: 0-9-12-4-10-3-13-2-5-0

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 2, 5, 13, 12>
- <0, 2, 14, 7, 12>
- <0, 8, 7, 12, 9>
- <0, 8, 7, 14, 2>
- <0, 9, 11, 2, 5>
- <0, 9, 12, 7, 14>
- <0, 9, 12, 4, 10>
- <0, 9, 12, 7, 8>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found: [0]
