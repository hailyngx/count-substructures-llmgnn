Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 24) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 23) (1, 3) (1, 10) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 28) (21, 0) (21, 2) (21, 17) (12, 3) (12, 27) (12, 8) (27, 25) (27, 12) (27, 26) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 26) (8, 22) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (17, 21) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 5) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 13) (28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 0) (22, 8) (22, 26) (22, 16) (26, 27) (26, 8) (26, 22) (23, 7) (23, 20) (0, 21) (0, 28) (20, 23) (20, 13) (20, 18) (2, 4) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 14) (19, 24) (19, 13) (24, 15) (24, 19) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 16) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 16) (18, 6) (18, 20) (18, 14) (5, 29) (16, 25) (16, 22) (16, 9) (16, 14) (11, 4) (11, 9) (13, 29) (13, 6) (13, 20) (13, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 6, 28, 25, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 6, 28, 0, 21, 2, 4, 11, 9, 10, 1, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 15, 6, 13, 29, 7, 4, 2, 21, 17, 29, 5, 13)
- Cycle 4: (3, 15, 6, 13, 29, 7, 4, 8, 26, 27, 25, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 15, 24, 19, 13, 29, 7, 4, 2, 21, 17, 29, 5, 13, 20, 18, 6)
- Cycle 6: (15, 24, 19, 13, 29, 7, 4, 2, 21, 17, 29, 5, 13, 20, 18, 6, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (6, 25)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (1, 21)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (4, 13)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (6, 25)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (15, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, 15, 6, (25), 28>
- <3, (15), 6, 28, 0, 21, 2, 4, 11, 9, 10, 1>
- <3, 15, (6), 13, 29, 7, 4, 2, 21, 17, 29, 5>
- <3, 15, 6, 13, 29, 7, (4), 8, 26, 27, 25>
- <3, 15, 24, (19), 13, 29, 7, 4, 2, 21, 17, 29, 5, 13, 20, 18, 6>
- <15, 24, (19), 13, 29, 7, 4, 2, 21, 17, 29, 5, 13, 20, 18, 6, (15)>
