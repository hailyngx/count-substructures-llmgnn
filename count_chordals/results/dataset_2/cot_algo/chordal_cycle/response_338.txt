Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-3-6-5
- Cycle 2: 9-3-8-9
- Cycle 3: 9-7-1-5-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (7, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, 9, 6, 3>
- <9, 3, 8, 9>
- <9, 7, 1, 5>
