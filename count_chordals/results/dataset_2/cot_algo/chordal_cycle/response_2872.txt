      49. <28, 13, 17, 26, 18>
      50. <28, 13, 17, 7, 12>

Step 2:
      The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
      1. <0, 1, 15, 28, 27>
      2. <0, 1, 15, 22, 4>
      3. <0, 1, 29, 14, 28>
      4. <0, 11, 12, 8, 29>
      5. <0, 11, 12, 23, 4>
      6. <1, 0, 11, 12, 8>
      7. <1, 0, 11, 12, 23>
      8. <1, 29, 14, 28, 13>
      9. <4, 22, 8, 12, 7>
      10. <4, 22, 8, 29, 14>
      11. <4, 23, 12, 7, 17>
      12. <4, 23, 12, 8, 29>
      13. <7, 12, 8, 29, 14>

      16. <12, 7, 17, 13, 28>
      17. <12, 23, 18, 26, 17>
      18. <12, 23, 18, 20, 21>
      19. <12, 23, 10, 9, 24>
  
Step 3:
      There are 19 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [19].
