Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 5-9-8-5
- Cycle 2: 5-3-0-4
- Cycle 3: 5-3-1-7
- Cycle 4: 9-8-4-0
- Cycle 5: 9-2-6-0
- Cycle 6: 4-7-3-0
- Cycle 7: 7-1-3-0
- Cycle 8: 3-5-9-2
- Cycle 9: 3-4-8-0
- Cycle 10: 3-7-1-3 (this is a self-loop)

Step 2:
Checking the cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 < (5, 9),  (5, 8) > has one chord: (5, 2)
- Cycle 2 < (5, 3), (4, 0) > has one chord: (3, 4)
- Cycle 3 < (5, 3), (3, 1) > has one chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 4 < (9, 8), (4, 0) > has one chord: (8, 0)
- Cycle 5 < (9, 2), (6, 0) > has one chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 6 < (4, 7), (4, 0) > has one chord: (7, 0)
- Cycle 7 < (7, 1), (7, 3) > has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 8 < (3, 5), (9, 2) > has one chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 9 < (3, 4), (8, 0) > has one chord: (4, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have 9 chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the final count is [9]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <5, 9, 8, 2>
- <5, 3, 4, 0>
- <5, 3, 1, 7>
- <9, 8, 4, 0>
- <9, 2, 6, 0>
- <4, 7, 3, 0>
- <7, 1, 3, 0>
- <3, 5, 9, 2>
- <3, 4, 8, 0>
