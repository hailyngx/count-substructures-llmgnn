Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 14, 11, 1)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 14, 0, 3)
- Cycle 3: (4, 10, 6, 1, 11)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 1, 11, 14)
- Cycle 5: (4, 8, 3, 0, 14)
- Cycle 6: (2, 5, 9, 14, 11)
- Cycle 7: (2, 5, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 8: (2, 6, 10, 7, 3)
- Cycle 9: (2, 6, 11, 1, 8)
- Cycle 10: (2, 6, 13, 9, 7)
- Cycle 11: (2, 13, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 12: (0, 4, 10, 6, 1)
- Cycle 13: (0, 4, 8, 1, 11)
- Cycle 14: (0, 4, 8, 3, 0)
- Cycle 15: (0, 3, 7, 9, 14)
- Cycle 16: (0, 14, 11, 1, 6)
- Cycle 17: (14, 5, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 18: (14, 5, 12, 8, 1)
- Cycle 19: (14, 0, 3, 7, 9)
- Cycle 20: (8, 4, 10, 6, 2)
- Cycle 21: (8, 4, 2, 6, 13)
- Cycle 22: (8, 4, 2, 13, 9)
- Cycle 23: (8, 3, 0, 14, 5)
- Cycle 24: (8, 12, 5, 9, 7)
- Cycle 25: (3, 0, 14, 11, 1)
- Cycle 26: (3, 0, 4, 8, 12)
- Cycle 27: (3, 7, 9, 5, 12)
- Cycle 28: (3, 7, 10, 6, 2)
- Cycle 29: (7, 9, 13, 2, 6)
- Cycle 30: (7, 3, 0, 14, 5)
- Cycle 31: (1, 11, 14, 0, 4)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (11, 14), 6>
- <2, (9, 14), 5>
- <3, (0, 14), 7>
- <4, (8, 1), 11>
- <5, (8, 3), 0>
- <6, (10, 6), 1>
- <7, (10, 6), 4>
- <8, (4, 2), 6>
- <9, (2, 13), 6>
- <10, (2, 6), 11>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
