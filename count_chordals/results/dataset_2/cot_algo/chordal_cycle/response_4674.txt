Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
        - Cycle 1: (1, 6, 0, 3, 1)
        - Cycle 2: (1, 4, 5, 3, 1)
        - Cycle 3: (1, 4, 0, 3, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (1, 3, 5, 4, 1)
        - Cycle 5: (3, 5, 4, 1, 3)
        - Cycle 6: (3, 4, 0, 1, 3)
        - Cycle 7: (0, 4, 5, 3, 0)
        - Cycle 8: (0, 4, 1, 6, 0)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: (1, 6, 0, 3, 1) has a chord 0-6
        - Cycle 2: (1, 4, 5, 3, 1) has a chord 5-4
        - Cycle 3: (1, 4, 0, 3, 1) has a chord 0-4
        - Cycle 4: (1, 3, 5, 4, 1) has a chord 5-3
        - Cycle 5: (3, 5, 4, 1, 3) has a chord 4-5
        - Cycle 6: (3, 4, 0, 1, 3) has a chord 0-4
        - Cycle 7: (0, 4, 5, 3, 0) has a chord 5-4
        - Cycle 8: (0, 4, 1, 6, 0) has a chord 1-4

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
