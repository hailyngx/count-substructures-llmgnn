- Cycle 25: (7, 3, 5, 1, 7)
- Cycle 26: (7, 9, 1, 5, 7)
- Cycle 27: (9, 1, 5, 3, 9)
- Cycle 28: (9, 3, 5, 1, 9)
- Cycle 29: (9, 4, 0, 3, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 2 has chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 3 has chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 4 has chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 5 has chord (0, 8)
- Cycle 6 has chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 7 has chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 8 has chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 9 has chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 10 has chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 11 has chord (0, 8)
- Cycle 12 has chord (3, 7)
- Cycle 13 has chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 14 has chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 15 has chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 16 has chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 17 has chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 18 has chord (9, 3)
- Cycle 19 has chord (0, 8)
- Cycle 20 has chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 21 has chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 22 has chord (0, 8)
- Cycle 23 has chord (3, 5)
- Cycle 24 has chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 25 has chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 26 has chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 27 has chord (3, 5)
- Cycle 28 has chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 29 has chord (0, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 29 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [29].
Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (2, 7), 5)>
<1, (5, 3), 7)>
<1, (7, 1), 9)>
<1, (9, 5), 3)>
<2, (0, 8), 7)>
<2, (5, 3), 6)>
<3, (1, 5), 6)>
<3, (2, 8), 7)>
<5, (0, 8), 2)>
<6, (1, 5), 3)>
<6, (2, 7), 5)>
<7, (0, 8), 2)>
<7, (1, 5), 3)>
<7, (1, 7), 9)>
<8, (3, 9), 4)>
<9, (3, 1), 5)>
<9, (1, 7), 4)>
