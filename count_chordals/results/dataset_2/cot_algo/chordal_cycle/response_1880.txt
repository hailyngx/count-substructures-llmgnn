Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 14) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 18) (2, 29) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 24) (7, 16) (7, 22) (7, 8) (21, 0) (21, 5) (21, 4) (6, 25) (6, 0) (9, 20) (0, 2) (0, 21) (0, 6) (0, 20) (20, 9) (20, 0) (20, 13) (1, 24) (26, 29) (26, 23) (26, 25) (17, 29) (17, 28) (3, 11) (4, 27) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 25) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 23) (12, 29) (12, 18) (23, 16) (23, 26) (23, 19) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 22) (22, 7) (22, 14) (22, 24) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 13) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 12) (10, 13) (5, 21) (5, 4) (25, 6) (25, 26) (25, 8) (24, 2) (24, 29) (24, 1) (24, 22) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the given graph are:
1. (11, 16, 8, 11)
2. (11, 14, 15, 27, 18, 14)
3. (2, 29, 17, 28, 2)
4. (16, 8, 7, 22, 14, 16)
5. (16, 8, 19, 4, 21, 0, 6, 25, 8)
6. (16, 8, 25, 6, 0, 2, 29, 24, 16)
7. (16, 8, 25, 26, 29, 2, 0, 6, 25)
8. (16, 8, 25, 26, 29, 24, 1, 24, 16)
9. (16, 8, 25, 26, 29, 24, 22, 7, 16)
10. (16, 14, 22, 7, 8, 11, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the cycles listed above, we find that the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <11, 14, 15, 27, 18, 14, 11>	with chord (27, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Since we found 1 chordal 4-cycle, the final count is [1].
