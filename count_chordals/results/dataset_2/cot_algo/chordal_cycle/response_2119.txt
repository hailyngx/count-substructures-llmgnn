Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 14) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-13-5-3-2-8-1
- Cycle 2: 1-9-7-8-2-3-1
- Cycle 3: 1-8-11-7-6-5-13-1
- Cycle 4: 1-13-0-6-7-8-1
- Cycle 5: 3-2-6-7-8-11-3
- Cycle 6: 3-5-13-0-6-2-3
- Cycle 7: 3-10-9-7-11-4-5-3
- Cycle 8: 5-13-0-12-10-4-5
- Cycle 9: 5-6-7-8-11-4-10-5
- Cycle 10: 6-5-4-11-8-7-6
- Cycle 11: 6-7-11-4-10-14-2-6
- Cycle 12: 8-7-6-2-3-10-9-8
- Cycle 13: 8-11-4-10-9-7-8
- Cycle 14: 9-1-13-0-6-7-11-9
- Cycle 15: 9-8-7-6-0-12-10-9
- Cycle 16: 10-3-2-6-7-9-12-10

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle [1]:
  <1, (13, 5), 3>

Thus, the final answer is [1].
