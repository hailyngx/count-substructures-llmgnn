Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <1, 2, 21, 13>
        - <1, 2, 12, 6>
        - <1, 2, 12, 6, 21>
        - <1, 2, 12, 6, 25>
        - <1, 2, 23, 15>
        - <1, 11, 3, 7>
        - <1, 11, 3, 8>
        - <1, 11, 3, 7, 14>
        - <1, 11, 3, 8, 15>
        - <1, 29, 17, 14>
        - <1, 29, 17, 28>
        - <2, 12, 6, 25>
        - <2, 12, 6, 21>
        - <2, 12, 6, 25, 28>
        - <2, 12, 6, 21, 13>
        - <2, 21, 13, 22>
        - <2, 21, 13, 18>
        - <2, 21, 13, 22, 26>
        - <2, 21, 13, 18, 25>
        - <2, 23, 15, 8>
        - <2, 23, 15, 8, 7>
        - <3, 7, 14, 17>
        - <3, 7, 14, 29>
        - <3, 7, 14, 17, 29>
        - <3, 7, 14, 28>
        - <3, 8, 15, 23>
        - <3, 8, 15, 23, 2>
        - <3, 11, 1, 29>
        - <3, 11, 1, 2>
        - <3, 11, 1, 29, 17>
        - <4, 18, 13, 21>
        - <4, 18, 13, 22>
        - <4, 18, 13, 21, 6>
        - <4, 18, 13, 22, 26>
        - <4, 15, 23, 2>
        - <4, 15, 23, 2, 21>
        - <4, 15, 23, 2, 12>
        - <4, 15, 23, 15>
        
Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, 2, 12, 6> has a chord (2, 6)
        - <1, 2, 12, 6, 21> has a chord (2, 21)
        - <1, 11, 3, 7> has a chord (11, 7)
        - <1, 29, 17, 14> has a chord (29, 14)
        - <2, 21, 13, 22> has a chord (21, 22)
        - <2, 23, 15, 8> has a chord (23, 8)
        - <3, 7, 14, 17> has a chord (7, 17)
        - <4, 18, 13, 21> has a chord (18, 21)
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        [7]
