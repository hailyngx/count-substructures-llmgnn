Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 1-4-8-5-1
        - Cycle 2: 1-4-2-0-1
        - Cycle 3: 1-4-2-0-3-1
        - Cycle 4: 1-4-7-3-1
        - Cycle 5: 1-4-7-9-1
        - Cycle 6: 1-4-8-9-1
        - Cycle 7: 1-5-8-6-1
        - Cycle 8: 1-5-6-1
        - Cycle 9: 1-6-8-5-1
        - Cycle 10: 1-6-5-8-1
        - Cycle 11: 1-8-4-7-1
        - Cycle 12: 1-8-4-2-1
        - Cycle 13: 1-8-4-2-0-1
        - Cycle 14: 1-8-4-7-3-1
        - Cycle 15: 1-9-8-4-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - The cycle <1, 4, 8, 5, 1> has one chord: (8, 5)
        - The cycle <1, 4, 2, 0, 1> has one chord: (4, 2)
        - The cycle <1, 4, 2, 0, 3, 1> has no chords
        - The cycle <1, 4, 7, 3, 1> has no chords
        - The cycle <1, 4, 7, 9, 1> has no chords
        - The cycle <1, 4, 8, 9, 1> has one chord: (8, 9)
        - The cycle <1, 5, 8, 6, 1> has no chords
        - The cycle <1, 5, 6, 1> has no chords
        - The cycle <1, 6, 8, 5, 1> has no chords
        - The cycle <1, 6, 5, 8, 1> has no chords
        - The cycle <1, 8, 4, 7, 1> has no chords
        - The cycle <1, 8, 4, 2, 1> has one chord: (4, 2)
        - The cycle <1, 8, 4, 2, 0, 1> has one chord: (4, 2)
        - The cycle <1, 8, 4, 7, 3, 1> has no chords
        - The cycle <1, 9, 8, 4, 1> has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 8 chordal 4-cycles in the graph: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <1, 4, 2, 0, 3, 1>
        <1, 4, 7, 3, 1>
        <1, 4, 7, 9, 1>
        <1, 5, 8, 6, 1>
        <1, 5, 6, 1>
        <1, 6, 8, 5, 1>
        <1, 6, 5, 8, 1>
        <1, 8, 4, 7, 1>
