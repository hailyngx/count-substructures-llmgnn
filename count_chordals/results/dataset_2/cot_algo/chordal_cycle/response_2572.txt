Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <8, 6, 16, 21, (8, 22)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <8, 15, 11, 2, (8, 6)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <8, 28, 1, 13, (8, 15)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, 22, 15, 11, (8, 28)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        - Number of chordless cycles: [36]
