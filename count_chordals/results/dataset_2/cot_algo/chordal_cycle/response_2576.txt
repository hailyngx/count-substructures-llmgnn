Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 6-9-4-0-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-3-1-6
- Cycle 3: 6-9-3-5-6
- Cycle 4: 6-9-4-5-6
- Cycle 5: 6-0-1-3-6
- Cycle 6: 6-0-1-5-6
- Cycle 7: 6-0-4-3-6
- Cycle 8: 6-0-4-5-6
- Cycle 9: 9-4-0-6-9
- Cycle 10: 9-4-5-6-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (9, 0).
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (9, 1).
- Cycle 3 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (9, 5).
- Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (9, 4).
- Cycle 5 is chordless.
- Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (0, 1).
- Cycle 7 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (0, 4).
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (0, 3).
- Cycle 9 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (4, 6).
- Cycle 10 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (4, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There is 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [9], and the unique chordal 4-cycles found are <6, (9, 0)>, <6, (9, 1)>, <6, (9, 5)>, <6, (9, 4)>, <6, 0, 1, 5>, <6, (0, 1)>, <6, (0, 4)>, <6, (0, 3)>, <9, (4, 6)>, <9, (4, 9)>.
