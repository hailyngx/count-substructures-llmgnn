Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <4, 5, 6, 0>
- <4, 5, 6, 2>
- <4, 6, 2, 9>
- <4, 6, 2, 0>
- <4, 6, 0, 9>
- <4, 6, 0, 2>
- <4, 9, 1, 7>
- <4, 9, 1, 3>
- <4, 9, 0, 6>
- <4, 9, 0, 2>
- <4, 9, 2, 6>
- <4, 9, 2, 0>
- <4, 2, 6, 0>
- <4, 2, 9, 1>
- <4, 2, 9, 0>
- <4, 2, 6, 5>
- <4, 2, 6, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle from Step 1:
- <4, 6, 2, 9> (Chord: (4, 2))
- <4, 6, 2, 0> (Chord: (4, 2))
- <4, 6, 0, 9> (Chord: (4, 0))
- <4, 6, 0, 2> (Chord: (4, 0))
- <4, 9, 1, 7> (Chord: (4, 7))
- <4, 9, 1, 3> (Chord: (4, 3))
- <4, 9, 0, 6> (Chord: (4, 6))
- <4, 9, 0, 2> (Chord: (4, 2))
- <4, 9, 2, 6> (Chord: (4, 6))
- <4, 9, 2, 0> (Chord: (4, 0))
- <4, 2, 6, 0> (Chord: (4, 6))
- <4, 2, 9, 1> (Chord: (4, 9))
- <4, 2, 9, 0> (Chord: (4, 9))
- <4, 2, 6, 5> (Chord: (4, 6))
- <4, 2, 6, 3> (Chord: (4, 6))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [15]
