Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 4, 8, 5, 0>
2. Cycle <1, 7, 5, 8, 4, 1>
3. Cycle <2, 9, 8, 5, 7, 2>
4. Cycle <3, 1, 2, 6, 5, 7, 3>
5. Cycle <4, 8, 9, 2, 4>
6. Cycle <5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 5>
7. Cycle <6, 2, 9, 8, 5, 7, 6>
8. Cycle <7, 5, 6, 2, 9, 8, 4, 7>
9. Cycle <8, 9, 2, 1, 7, 5, 6, 8>
10. Cycle <9, 2, 1, 3, 7, 5, 8, 9>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <3, 1, 2, 6, 5, 7, 3> with a chord (3, 5)
- <4, 8, 9, 2, 4> with a chord (4, 2)
- <5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 5> with a chord (5, 9)
- <6, 2, 9, 8, 5, 7, 6> with a chord (6, 9)
- <7, 5, 6, 2, 9, 8, 4, 7> with a chord (7, 9)
- <8, 9, 2, 1, 7, 5, 6, 8> with a chord (8, 6)
- <9, 2, 1, 3, 7, 5, 8, 9> with a chord (9, 7)

Step 3:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
