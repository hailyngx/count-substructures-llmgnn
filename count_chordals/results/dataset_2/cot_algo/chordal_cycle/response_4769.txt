The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 28) (2, 29) (2, 18) (29, 2) (29, 8) (29, 14) (3, 15) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 11) (15, 16) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (8, 29) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 27) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 28) (4, 5) (4, 8) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 1) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 11) (28, 9) (28, 13) (28, 24) (20, 27) (20, 22) (17, 24) (17, 27) (1, 8) (1, 18) (24, 28) (24, 17) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 23) (7, 6) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 22) (10, 21) (10, 12) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 14) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 12) (23, 26) (23, 12) (12, 21) (12, 10) (12, 22) (12, 23) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 16) (0, 6) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 19) (11, 5) (11, 15) (11, 21) (11, 0) (11, 27) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 0) (27, 8) (27, 20) (27, 17) (27, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 13, 8, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (6, 13, 8, 4, 6)
  
Step 2:
Check for chords:
- In Cycle 1: (13, 4) is a chord
- In Cycle 2: (13, 8) is a chord

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, 13, 4, 8> 
<6, 13, 8, 4>
