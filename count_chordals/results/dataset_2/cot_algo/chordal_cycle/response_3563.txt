Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-2-1-6
- Cycle 2: 6-7-2-1-6
- Cycle 3: 6-8-4-1-6
- Cycle 4: 6-4-1-9-6
- Cycle 5: 6-1-3-2-6
- Cycle 6: 6-1-5-4-6
- Cycle 7: 6-1-4-9-6
- Cycle 8: 6-1-0-5-6

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (2, 6)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (7, 6)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle: <4, (1, 9), 6>
- Cycle 5 is chordal 4-cycle: <1, (2, 3), 6>
- Cycle 6 has multiple (2) chords (1, 5) and (4, 6)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle: <0, (1, 5), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- The unique chordal 4-cycles found are <4, (1, 9), 6>, <1, (2, 3), 6>, and <0, (1, 5), 6>.
- Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
