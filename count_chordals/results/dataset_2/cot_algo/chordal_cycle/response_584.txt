Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 12) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle: 5-9-8-5
2. Cycle: 5-13-12-5
3. Cycle: 5-14-12-5
4. Cycle: 9-0-10-9
5. Cycle: 0-11-12-0
6. Cycle: 7-8-9-7
7. Cycle: 7-1-9-7
8. Cycle: 1-10-14-1
9. Cycle: 1-11-12-1
10. Cycle: 3-6-11-3
11. Cycle: 3-10-14-3
12. Cycle: 11-6-0-11
13. Cycle: 13-2-1-13
14. Cycle: 13-11-0-13
15. Cycle: 14-5-4-14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

1. Cycle: 5-9-8-5 (Chord: 9-8)
   Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (9-8), 5>
2. Cycle: 5-13-12-5 (Chord: 13-12)
   Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (13-12), 5>
3. Cycle: 5-14-12-5 (Chord: 14-12)
   Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (14-12), 5>
4. Cycle: 9-0-10-9 (Chord: 0-10)
   Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (0-10), 9>
5. Cycle: 0-11-12-0 (Chord: 11-12)
   Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (11-12), 0>
6. Cycle: 7-8-9-7 (Chord: 8-9)
   Chordal 4-cycle: <7, (8-9), 7>
7. Cycle: 7-1-9-7 (Chord: 1-9)
   Chordal 4-cycle: <7, (1-9), 7>
8. Cycle: 1-10-14-1 (Chord: 10-14)
   Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (10-14), 1>
9. Cycle: 1-11-12-1 (Chord: 11-12)
   Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (11-12), 1>
10. Cycle: 3-6-11-3 (Chord: 6-11)
    Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (6-11), 3>
11. Cycle: 3-10-14-3 (Chord: 10-14)
    Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (10-14), 3>
12. Cycle: 11-6-0-11 (Chord: 6-0)
    Chordal 4-cycle: <11, (6-0), 11>
13. Cycle: 13-2-1-13 (Chord: 2-1)
    Chordal 4-cycle: <13, (2-1), 13>
14. Cycle: 13-11-0-13 (Chord: 11-0)
    Chordal 4-cycle: <13, (11-0), 13>
15. Cycle: 14-5-4-14 (Chord: 5-4)
    Chordal 4-cycle: <14, (5-4), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since all identified cycles are chordal, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
