Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 4) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 7) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 11) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (16, 13) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 1) (1, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <3, 0, 13, 12>
- Cycle 2: <5, 15, 8, 14>
- Cycle 3: <5, 15, 18, 17>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 7, 6>
- Cycle 5: <5, 9, 7, 14>
- Cycle 6: <5, 10, 0, 11>
- Cycle 7: <9, 7, 14, 12>
- Cycle 8: <13, 17, 18, 15>
- Cycle 9: <13, 17, 18, 14>
- Cycle 10: <13, 17, 2, 11>
- Cycle 11: <13, 0, 11, 2>
- Cycle 12: <8, 15, 18, 17>
- Cycle 13: <8, 15, 18, 1>
- Cycle 14: <8, 19, 4, 3>
- Cycle 15: <8, 19, 4, 2>
- Cycle 16: <8, 19, 4, 14>
- Cycle 17: <9, 7, 14, 18>
- Cycle 18: <16, 13, 17, 18>
- Cycle 19: <16, 13, 17, 2>
- Cycle 20: <17, 18, 14, 2>


Step 2:
Among these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal 4-Cycle 1: <5, 15, 8, 14>, chord is (18, 17)
- Chordal 4-Cycle 2: <13, 0, 11, 2>, chord is (17, 14)
- Chordal 4-Cycle 3: <8, 19, 4, 3>, chord is (19, 4)
- Chordal 4-Cycle 4: <8, 19, 4, 14>, chord is (19, 4)


Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [16].
