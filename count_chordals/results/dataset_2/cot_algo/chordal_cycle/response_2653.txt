Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 7, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 0, 5, 4)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 2, 8, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 6, 1, 4, 3)
- Cycle 5: (5, 4, 1, 8, 5)
- Cycle 6: (8, 0, 3, 6, 8)
- Cycle 7: (9, 7, 3, 2, 9)
- Cycle 8: (5, 3, 7, 9, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 <1, (9, 7), 5)>
- Cycle 2 <2, (8, 0), 4)>
- Cycle 4 <3, (6, 1), 4)>
- Cycle 5 <5, (1, 8), 5)>
- Cycle 6 <6, (3, 6), 8)>
- Cycle 7 <7, (3, 2), 9)>
- Cycle 8 <8, (7, 9), 5)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless cycles found.
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
