Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (6, 3) (6, 27) (9, 17) (9, 10) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 29) (18, 20) (18, 24) (26, 10) (26, 25) (26, 4) (15, 7) (15, 23) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 2) (11, 23) (11, 8) (23, 15) (23, 11) (23, 4) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 24) (4, 26) (4, 23) (4, 2) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 28) (3, 8) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 22) (28, 2) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 29) (25, 26) (25, 1) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 24) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 27) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 28) (2, 24) (13, 16) (13, 21) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 25) (20, 18) (27, 6) (27, 8) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 29) (29, 0) (29, 21) (29, 22) (24, 18) (24, 19) (24, 10) (24, 2) (24, 22) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 25, 26, 10, 9, 17, 19, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 5, 19, 17, 16, 21, 29, 22, 24, 18, 20, 24, 2)
- Cycle 3: (3, 8, 7, 12, 14, 0, 29, 21, 16, 2, 28, 8, 11, 23, 4, 26, 25, 1, 14, 0, 12, 7, 15, 23, 11, 8, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 5, 19, 24, 18, 20, 24, 22, 29, 21, 16, 17, 9, 10, 26, 4, 2, 5)
- Cycle 5: (3, 28, 2, 5, 19, 24, 22, 29, 0, 12, 7, 15, 23, 4, 26, 10, 9, 17, 16, 21, 13, 16, 17, 19, 5, 1, 25, 26, 4, 23, 11, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 25, 26, 10, 9, 17, 19, 5> (Chord: (17, 9))
- <2, 5, 19, 17, 16, 21, 29, 22> (Chord: (16, 17))
- <3, 5, 19, 24, 18, 20, 24, 22> (Chord: (19, 17))
- <3, 28, 2, 5, 19, 24, 22, 29> (Chord: (5, 19))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- We found 4 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [4].
