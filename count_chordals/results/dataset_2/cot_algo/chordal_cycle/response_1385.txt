Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 3) (26, 28) (26, 3) (11, 16) (11, 23) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 19) (16, 14) (16, 27) (18, 22) (18, 17) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 0) (22, 8) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 17) (27, 16) (27, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 20) (28, 26) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 10) (5, 13) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 25) (5, 17) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 24) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (19, 16) (19, 4) (25, 5) (25, 21) (25, 10) (29, 9) (29, 16) (29, 21) (2, 12) (2, 4) (24, 13) (24, 8) (15, 9) (15, 0) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 9) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) (21, 13) (21, 25) (21, 29) (21, 4) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 21) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 8) (10, 25) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 5) (14, 16) (14, 23) (20, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
<5, 25, 10, 6> - Cycle of length 4
<5, 25, 21, 29> - Cycle of length 4
<21, 29, 16, 11> - Cycle of length 4
<21, 29, 9, 15> - Cycle of length 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
<5, 25, 10, 6> - Chord: (10, 25) 
<5, 25, 21, 29> - Chord: (5, 29)
<21, 29, 16, 11> - Chord: (16, 21)
<21, 29, 9, 15> - Chord: (9, 21)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
