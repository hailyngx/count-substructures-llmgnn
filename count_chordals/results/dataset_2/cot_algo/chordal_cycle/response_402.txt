Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 4) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 19) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 2) (15, 4) (15, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 6) (8, 1) (8, 11) (19, 1) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 12) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 10) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 18) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (18, 10) (18, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 6, 17, 13>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 4, 17>
- Cycle 3: <6, 17, 4, 15>
- Cycle 4: <6, 2, 14, 12>
- Cycle 5: <6, 13, 3, 7>
- Cycle 6: <16, 0, 10, 18>
- Cycle 7: <16, 7, 3, 13>
- Cycle 8: <16, 12, 14, 2>
- Cycle 9: <7, 3, 13, 17>
- Cycle 10: <17, 4, 15, 16>
- Cycle 11: <17, 6, 2, 7>
- Cycle 12: <2, 14, 12, 16>
- Cycle 13: <2, 6, 17, 4>
- Cycle 14: <10, 0, 16, 7>
- Cycle 15: <10, 12, 14, 2>
- Cycle 16: <10, 18, 11, 5>
- Cycle 17: <3, 13, 17, 6>
- Cycle 18: <3, 7, 16, 12>
- Cycle 19: <13, 17, 4, 15>
- Cycle 20: <13, 3, 7, 16>
- Cycle 21: <14, 2, 6, 5>
- Cycle 22: <12, 14, 2, 6>
- Cycle 23: <12, 16, 7, 3>
- Cycle 24: <4, 9, 11, 1>
- Cycle 25: <4, 17, 13, 3>
- Cycle 26: <15, 4, 17, 6>
- Cycle 27: <15, 16, 7, 3>
- Cycle 28: <18, 10, 0, 16>
- Cycle 29: <18, 11, 1, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 6, 17, 13> with chord (6, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <16, 0, 10, 18> with chord (0, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [27]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are <5, 6, 17, 13> and <16, 0, 10, 18>.
