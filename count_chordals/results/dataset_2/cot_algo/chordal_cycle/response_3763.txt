Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 11) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 6-5-4-8-6
- Cycle 2: 6-7-13-7-6
- Cycle 3: 6-2-12-8-6
- Cycle 4: 6-0-8-4-6
- Cycle 5: 9-6-5-4-9
- Cycle 6: 9-7-13-7-9
- Cycle 7: 9-0-8-4-9
- Cycle 8: 1-7-13-7-1
- Cycle 9: 11-9-6-5-11
- Cycle 10: 11-14-1-7-11
- Cycle 11: 11-3-11
- Cycle 12: 11-12-2-7-11
- Cycle 13: 2-6-5-4-2
- Cycle 14: 2-7-13-7-2
- Cycle 15: 2-10-4-5-2
- Cycle 16: 2-12-8-4-2
- Cycle 17: 12-8-4-5-12
- Cycle 18: 12-2-10-4-12
- Cycle 19: 14-6-5-11-14

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <1, (7, 13), 7)>
- <11, (9, 6), 5)>
- <11, (1, 7), 14)>
- <2, (6, 5), 4)>
- <2, (7, 13), 4)>
- <2, (4, 8), 12)>
- <4, (6, 5), 2)>
- <4, (8, 12), 2)>
- <5, (6, 4), 2)>
- <5, (12, 8), 2)>
- <9, (6, 5), 4)>
- <9, (7, 13), 4)>
- <12, (8, 4), 5)>

Step 3:
There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final answer is [13].
