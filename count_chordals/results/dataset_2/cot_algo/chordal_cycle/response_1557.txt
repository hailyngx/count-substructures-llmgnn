Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 14) (4, 13) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 1) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 2) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 14) (12, 16) (12, 15) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 7) (18, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-16-12-15-11-9-8-10-17-3-19-6-5-18-7-1-2-13-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-16-14-19-5-18-7-1-2-17-10-8-9-11-15-12-16-0
- Cycle 3: 8-10-15-12-16-19-14-10-17-3-19-5-18-7-0-2-9-11-15-10-8
- Cycle 4: 10-17-2-13-4-0-2-1-7-0-6-19-16-14-10
- Cycle 5: 17-2-1-7-18-5-19-3-17

Step 2:
By checking each cycle, we find that Cycle 1 has a unique chord (9,13).
Hence, [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 16, 14, 19>, chord (16, 14)
<10, 8, 9, 11>, chord (8, 9)
<10, 15, 12, 16>, chord (15, 12)
<8, 9, 11, 15>, chord (9, 11)
