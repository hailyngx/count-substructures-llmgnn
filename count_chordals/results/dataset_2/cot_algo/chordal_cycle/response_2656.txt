Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 27) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 19) (21, 20) (21, 18) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 24) (29, 26) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 25) (13, 27) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 20) (5, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 15) (25, 29) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 10) (25, 11) (16, 17) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 19) (20, 21) (20, 29) (20, 5) (20, 7) (9, 29) (9, 15) (2, 22) (2, 4) (22, 0) (22, 14) (22, 2) (3, 17) (3, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (11, 0) (11, 25) (11, 6) (11, 8) (19, 14) (19, 16) (15, 7) (15, 9) (23, 1) (23, 16) (23, 27) (10, 25) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (18, 21) (18, 5) (8, 26) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 10) (4, 25) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 10) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are a total of 4-cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 7, 20, 29, 25, 11, 0, 14)
- Cycle 2: (3, 10, 25, 11, 6, 14, 19, 16)
- Cycle 3: (4, 10, 25, 11, 0, 14, 6, 11)
- Cycle 4: (5, 20, 29, 26, 24, 17, 3, 10)
- Cycle 5: (8, 26, 29, 20, 7, 1, 23, 16)
- Cycle 6: (8, 26, 24, 17, 3, 10, 8, 0)
- Cycle 7: (8, 11, 6, 14, 19, 16, 23, 27)
- Cycle 8: (8, 10, 4, 2, 22, 14, 19, 16)
- Cycle 9: (16, 19, 14, 22, 2, 4, 10, 3)
- Cycle 10: (20, 29, 26, 8, 0, 14, 22, 2)
- Cycle 11: (27, 23, 16, 4, 25, 11, 6, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (0, 14), 7, 25>
- <3, (10, 25), 11, 6>
- <4, (10, 25), 11, 0>
- <5, (20, 29), 26, 24>
- <8, (26, 24), 17, 3>
- <11, (6, 14), 19, 16>
- <13, (22, 14), 19, 16>
- <16, (9, 22), 2, 14>
- <19, (27, 23), 16, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
