Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 10) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-4-9-13-5
- Cycle 2: 9-4-1-10-9
- Cycle 3: 1-12-11-3-1
- Cycle 4: 13-5-11-3-13
- Cycle 5: 4-8-10-14-4
- Cycle 6: 0-9-14-6-0
- Cycle 7: 11-5-13-8-11
- Cycle 8: 6-7-11-12-6

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 5, 9, 13> has the chord (1, 9)
- <9, 4, 1, 10> has the chord (4, 10)
- <1, 12, 11, 3> has the chord (1, 11)
- <13, 5, 11, 3> has the chord (5, 11)
- <4, 8, 10, 14> has the chord (8, 14)
- <0, 9, 14, 6> has the chord (9, 14)
- <11, 5, 13, 8> has the chord (5, 13)
- <6, 7, 11, 12> has the chord (7, 11)

Step 3: 
Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
