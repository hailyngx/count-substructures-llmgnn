Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (1, 4) (1, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 18) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 18) (15, 17) (15, 0) (8, 14) (8, 17) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 18) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (7, 5) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 10) (2, 9) (2, 11) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-13-9-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-17-14-8-5
- Cycle 3: 5-7-16-3-5
- Cycle 4: 9-4-3-16-9
- Cycle 5: 9-13-18-1-9
- Cycle 6: 14-17-15-0-14
- Cycle 7: 14-19-18-1-14
- Cycle 8: 14-17-8-6-10-12-0-15-14
- Cycle 9: 17-15-0-12-6-11-2-9-13-17
- Cycle 10: 17-5-7-16-18-13-9-0-15-17

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (14, 8)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (7, 16)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (4, 3)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (13, 18)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (0, 15)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (19, 18)
- Cycle 8 has no chords
- Cycle 9 has no chords
- Cycle 10 has no chords

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, (9, 5)>
<17, (14, 8)>
<16, (7, 16)>
<9, (4, 3)>
<13, (13, 18)>
