Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 3 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 3: 2 - 5 - 9 - 2
- Cycle 4: 6 - 1 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 5: 6 - 1 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 6: 7 - 2 - 5 - 7
- Cycle 7: 7 - 3 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 8: 7 - 3 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 9: 8 - 1 - 3 - 8
- Cycle 10: 8 - 7 - 3 - 8

Step 2:
Identifying the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4: 6 - 1 <2, 3> 6
- Cycle 5: 6 - 8 <1, 3> 6

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, 4, 6, 0>
- <1, 3, 7, 1>
- <2, 5, 9, 2>
- <7, 2, 5, 7>
- <7, 3, 1, 7>
- <7, 3, 6, 7>
- <8, 1, 3, 8>
- <8, 7, 3, 8>
