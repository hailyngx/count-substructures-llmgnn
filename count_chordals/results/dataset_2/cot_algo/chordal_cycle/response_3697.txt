Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 

List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-9-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-4-6-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-9-4-1
- Cycle 4: 0-4-6-8-0
- Cycle 5: 0-4-9-3-0
- Cycle 6: 0-5-8-6-0
- Cycle 7: 0-5-2-1-0
- Cycle 8: 2-1-3-4-2
- Cycle 9: 2-1-7-9-2

Step 2:

Checking cycles for a single chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord, 3-9
- Cycle 2 has one chord, 3-4
- Cycle 3 has one chord, 7-9
- Cycle 4 has one chord, 4-8
- Cycle 5 has one chord, 4-9
- Cycle 6 has one chord, 5-8
- Cycle 7 has one chord, 5-2
- Cycle 8 has one chord, 1-4
- Cycle 9 has one chord, 1-9

Step 3:

Count of chordal 4-cycles: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <1, 3, 9, 4> (chord: (3, 9))
2. <1, 3, 4, 6> (chord: (3, 4))
3. <1, 7, 9, 4> (chord: (7, 9))
4. <0, 4, 6, 8> (chord: (4, 8))
5. <0, 4, 9, 3> (chord: (4, 9))
6. <0, 5, 8, 6> (chord: (5, 8))
7. <0, 5, 2, 1> (chord: (5, 2))
8. <2, 1, 3, 4> (chord: (1, 4))
9. <2, 1, 7, 9> (chord: (1, 9))
