Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 19) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (3, 5) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 7) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 12) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 12) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 19) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 19) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 13, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 3, 15, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 13, 5, 3, 15, 4, 13, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 10, 0, 17, 1, 12, 2)
- Cycle 5: (4, 8, 12, 1, 13, 4)
- Cycle 6: (6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 7, 6)
- Cycle 7: (7, 17, 0, 10, 2, 19, 6, 7)
- Cycle 8: (9, 8, 12, 6, 19, 16, 11, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (5, 4)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (5, 15)
- Cycle 3 has two chords: (13, 3) and (15, 1)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (10, 1)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (8, 1)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (8, 14)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (17, 10)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (8, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (5, 4)>
<2, (5, 15)>
<3, (13, 3), (15, 1)>
<4, (10, 1)>
<5, (8, 1)>
<6, (8, 14)>
<7, (17, 10)>
<8, (8, 16)>
