Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 12) (16, 7) (16, 15) (3, 1) (15, 16) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 7) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 13) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 1) (14, 2) (14, 4) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 13) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 0, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 0, 13, 18, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 0, 12, 11, 6, 8, 2, 14, 4, 5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 0, 12, 11, 6, 19, 18, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 0, 13, 18, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 3, 0, 12, 11, 6, 8, 2, 15, 16, 7, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal cycles found:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <1, 3, 0, 13, 18, 1> with chord (0, 5)
- Chordal Cycle 2: <1, 3, 0, 12, 11, 6, 8, 2, 15, 16, 7, 1> with chord (14, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2]. The unique chordal 4-cycles found are <1, 3, 0, 13, 18, 1> and <1, 3, 0, 12, 11, 6, 8, 2, 15, 16, 7, 1>.
