Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-3-9-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-7-11-4-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-14-12-0-1
- Cycle 4: 3-13-12-5-3
- Cycle 5: 3-13-12-0-5-3
- Cycle 6: 10-7-11-2-10
- Cycle 7: 10-7-3-1-10
- Cycle 8: 10-5-12-0-10
- Cycle 9: 8-1-14-12-0-8
- Cycle 10: 8-1-3-9-2-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: Chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 2: Chord (7, 11)
- Cycle 3: Chord (14, 12)
- Cycle 4: Chord (13, 12)
- Cycle 5: Chord (13, 12)
- Cycle 6: Chord (7, 11)
- Cycle 7: Chord (3, 1)
- Cycle 8: Chord (5, 12)
- Cycle 9: Chord (1, 14)
- Cycle 10: Chord (3, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 1 chordless cycle found, so the final count is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1-14-12-0-1>
