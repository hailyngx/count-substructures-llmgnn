Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: {5, 9, 6, 5}
- Cycle 2: {5, 4, 8, 5}
- Cycle 3: {5, 6, 9, 8, 5}
- Cycle 4: {9, 8, 4, 5, 9}
- Cycle 5: {9, 2, 1, 8, 9}
- Cycle 6: {4, 8, 7, 0, 4}
- Cycle 7: {4, 6, 5, 9, 4}
- Cycle 8: {7, 0, 4, 8, 7}
- Cycle 9: {7, 8, 9, 6, 7}
- Cycle 10: {7, 8, 1, 2, 7}
- Cycle 11: {6, 5, 4, 8, 6}
- Cycle 12: {8, 9, 2, 3, 8}
- Cycle 13: {8, 7, 0, 2, 8}
- Cycle 14: {8, 1, 2, 3, 8}
- Cycle 15: {2, 9, 5, 6, 2}
- Cycle 16: {2, 1, 8, 9, 2}
- Cycle 17: {2, 3, 8, 1, 2}
- Cycle 18: {0, 4, 5, 6, 0}
- Cycle 19: {0, 7, 8, 4, 0}
- Cycle 20: {0, 2, 9, 3, 0}
- Cycle 21: {0, 3, 8, 7, 0}
- Cycle 22: {3, 9, 6, 5, 3}
- Cycle 23: {3, 8, 7, 0, 3}
- Cycle 24: {3, 2, 9, 8, 3}
- Cycle 25: {1, 2, 9, 5, 1}
- Cycle 26: {1, 8, 4, 5, 1}
- Cycle 27: {1, 0, 7, 8, 1}

Step 2: Identify chordal 4-cycles:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (0, 2), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (3, 9), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (0, 8), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (5, 8), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (6, 9), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
  
  There are [5] chordal 4-cycles found.
