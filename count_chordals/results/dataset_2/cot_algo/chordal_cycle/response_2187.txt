Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 19) (2, 29) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 14) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 1) (22, 19) (22, 11) (23, 8) (23, 6) (23, 10) (23, 0) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 15) (8, 17) (18, 9) (18, 0) (6, 3) (6, 23) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 27) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 6) (26, 14) (26, 15) (26, 16) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 11) (27, 6) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 10) (27, 20) (17, 8) (17, 13) (20, 8) (20, 27) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 19) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 27) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 1) (19, 9) (19, 22) (19, 13) (19, 24) (7, 29) (11, 22) (11, 4) (11, 21) (1, 25) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (16, 9) (16, 26) (16, 12) (24, 3) (24, 19) (24, 21) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 0) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 18) (0, 15) (10, 2) (10, 23) (10, 27) (21, 11) (21, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <2, 29, 7, 0>
2. <3, 25, 1, 6>
3. <6, 23, 8, 28>
4. <4, 27, 6, 1>
5. <8, 20, 27, 6>
6. <13, 17, 8, 28>
7. <14, 27, 6, 1>
8. <19, 13, 17, 8>
9. <1, 25, 3, 6>
10. <9, 18, 0, 29>
11. <11, 22, 19, 13>
12. <12, 16, 26, 14>
13. <15, 26, 14, 29>
14. <16, 26, 14, 29>
15. <20, 27, 6, 1>
16. <21, 11, 22, 19>
17. <23, 8, 28, 6>
18. <24, 21, 11, 4>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
1. <2, 29, 7, 0> with chord (29, 7)
2. <6, 23, 8, 28> with chord (23, 8)
3. <19, 13, 17, 8> with chord (13, 17)
4. <9, 18, 0, 29> with chord (9, 18)
5. <12, 16, 26, 14> with chord (16, 26)
6. <15, 26, 14, 29> with chord (26, 14)
7. <21, 11, 22, 19> with chord (11, 22)

Step 3:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [7].
