Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, but we are interested in cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-4-9-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-4-7-1
- Cycle 3: 1-2-5-6-1
- Cycle 4: 1-0-5-2-1
- Cycle 5: 3-4-11-14-3
- Cycle 6: 5-6-7-8-5
- Cycle 7: 5-6-10-2-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

From the cycles listed above, we have found one unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, (3, 9), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
