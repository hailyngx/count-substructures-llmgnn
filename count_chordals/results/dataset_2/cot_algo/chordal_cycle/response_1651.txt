Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 6 - 9 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 6 - 9 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 6 - 3 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 6 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 6 - 8 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 6: 0 - 6 - 8 - 5 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has a chord (6, 5).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (6, 0).
- Cycle 5 has a chord (6, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
1. <1, (4, 0), 3, 6>
2. <2, (5, 8), 6, 9>
3. <4, (1, 0), 5, 9>
