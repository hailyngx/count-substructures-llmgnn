Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <8, 11, 1, 17>
2. <8, 11, 19, 25>
3. <8, 6, 5, 0>
4. <8, 6, 10, 25>
5. <8, 6, 10, 9>
6. <8, 6, 5, 18>
7. <8, 6, 10, 25, 19>
8. <8, 6, 10, 25, 23>
9. <8, 6, 10, 9, 22, 29>
10. <8, 6, 10, 25, 19, 4>
11. <8, 11, 19, 25, 23>
12. <8, 11, 19, 25, 10>
13. <8, 11, 1, 2>
14. <8, 11, 1, 17, 21>
15. <8, 11, 19, 25, 23, 15>
16. <8, 11, 19, 25, 10, 6>
17. <8, 11, 19, 25, 10, 9>
18. <8, 11, 19, 4, 13, 24>
19. <8, 11, 12, 18, 29, 22>
20. <8, 11, 12, 18, 29, 17>
21. <8, 11, 12, 7, 24, 13>
22. <8, 11, 12, 7, 26, 22>
23. <8, 11, 12, 18, 29, 17, 1>
24. <8, 11, 19, 4, 13, 22>
25. <8, 11, 19, 25, 23, 15, 26>
26. <8, 11, 19, 25, 10, 9, 22>
27. <8, 11, 12, 7, 26, 15>
28. <8, 6, 10, 25, 19, 4, 13>
29. <8, 11, 12, 7, 24, 13, 4>

Step 2: Identify chordal 4-cycles:

- Out of the cycles listed above, the following are chordal 4-cycles because they have exactly one chord:
    1. <8, 11, 1, 17> with chord (8, 1)
    2. <8, 11, 19, 25> with chord (11, 19)
    3. <8, 6, 5, 0> with chord (6, 5)
    4. <8, 11, 1, 17, 21> with chord (11, 21)
    5. <8, 6, 5, 18> with chord (6, 18)
    6. <8, 11, 12, 7, 26, 22> with chord (7, 22)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [23]
