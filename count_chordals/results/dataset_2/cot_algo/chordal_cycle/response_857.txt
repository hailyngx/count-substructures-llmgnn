Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 6, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 3, 7, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 0, 5, 1>
- Cycle 5: <3, 6, 7, 0, 3>
- Cycle 6: <3, 7, 1, 5, 3>
- Cycle 7: <4, 8, 5, 0, 4>
- Cycle 8: <4, 9, 2, 6, 4>
- Cycle 9: <8, 5, 0, 7, 8>
- Cycle 10: <0, 7, 6, 2, 0>

Step 2:
- Out of the 10 cycles listed, there are 3 chordal 4-cycles:
    - <1, (3, 7), 6, 1>
    - <1, (5, 8), 1>
    - <4, (2, 9), 6, 4>
  
Step 3:
- The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [7].
