Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (10, 17) (10, 18) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 11) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 0) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 15) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 7) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 1) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 19) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 19) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 15) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 1) (14, 6) (2, 4) (2, 13) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 11) (12, 6) (12, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<1, 4, 8, 9>  
<1, 4, 3, 17>  
<1, 4, 3, 8>  
<1, 4, 2, 13>

<1, 11, 15, 5>  
<1, 11, 15, 0>  
<1, 19, 3, 17>  
<1, 19, 7, 16>

<3, 8, 4, 1>  
<3, 8, 4, 2>  
<3, 8, 18, 10>  
<3, 19, 7, 1>  
<4, 1, 7, 19>  
<4, 2, 13, 5>  
<4, 2, 13, 16>  
<5, 17, 10, 18>  
<5, 17, 3, 4>  
<5, 13, 16, 0>

<7, 19, 1, 4>  
<8, 9, 6, 14>  
<8, 18, 10, 17>  
<9, 6, 14, 6>  
<10, 17, 5, 13>  
<10, 18, 12, 6>  
<11, 17, 10, 18>  
<11, 17, 3, 4>  
<11, 15, 0, 16>  
<12, 6, 9, 8>  
<12, 18, 10, 17>  
<13, 17, 3, 4>  
<13, 2, 4, 1>  
<13, 5, 17, 10>  
<13, 5, 15, 11>  
<13, 16, 0, 15>  
<14, 6, 9, 8>  
<15, 5, 13, 2>  
<15, 5, 17, 11>

<16, 0, 15, 11>  
<16, 7, 19, 3>  
<17, 5, 13, 2>  
<17, 5, 15, 11>  
<17, 10, 18, 12>  
<17, 11, 1, 4>  
<17, 3, 4, 1>  
<17, 3, 19, 7>  
<18, 10, 17, 11>  
<18, 10, 17, 5>  
<18, 8, 3, 4>  
<18, 8, 4, 2>  
<19, 7, 16, 13>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
<[1, 4, 2, 13], (1, 4)>  
<[1, 7, 19, 3], (1, 19)>  
<[1, 11, 15, 0], (1, 15)>  
<[2, 4, 3, 17], (2, 3)>  
<[2, 13, 16, 0], (2, 16)>  
<[3, 17, 10, 18], (3, 10)>  
<[7, 1, 4, 3], (7, 4)>  
<[7, 16, 13, 5], (7, 13)>  
<[8, 9, 6, 14], (8, 6)>  
<[10, 17, 5, 13], (10, 5)>  
<[12, 6, 9, 8], (12, 9)>  
<[13, 2, 4, 1], (13, 4)>  
<[13, 5, 17, 10], (13, 17)>  
<[15, 0, 16, 7], (15, 16)>  
<[17, 5, 13, 2], (17, 13)>  
<[17, 10, 18, 12], (17, 18)>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 15 chordal 4-cycles in total, therefore the final count is [15].
