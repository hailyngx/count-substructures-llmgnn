Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-1-0-4
- Cycle 2: 4-6-3-9-4
- Cycle 3: 7-6-2-8-7
- Cycle 4: 1-9-3-8-1
- Cycle 5: 2-8-0-9-2
- Cycle 6: 0-1-7-8-0
- Cycle 7: 9-3-6-4-9

Step 2:
Checking for the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-1-0-4 with chord (7, 1)
- Cycle 2: 4-6-3-9-4 with chord (6, 3)
- Cycle 3: 7-6-2-8-7 with chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 4: 1-9-3-8-1 with chord (9, 3)
- Cycle 5: 2-8-0-9-2 with chord (8, 9)
- Cycle 6: 0-1-7-8-0 with chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 7: 9-3-6-4-9 with chord (3, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
The chordal 4-cycle found is <4, (7, 1)> with the chord (7, 1).
