Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

In this graph, we have the following cycles:

Cycle 1: (4, 1, 2, 4)
Cycle 2: (4, 2, 3, 6, 4)
Cycle 3: (4, 2, 3, 0, 2, 4)
Cycle 4: (4, 2, 1, 6, 4)
Cycle 5: (7, 6, 3, 2, 7)
Cycle 6: (7, 6, 3, 0, 2, 7)
Cycle 7: (7, 6, 1, 2, 4, 7)
Cycle 8: (7, 6, 1, 2, 0, 3, 6)
Cycle 9: (6, 1, 2, 4, 7, 6)
Cycle 10: (6, 1, 2, 0, 3, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

In these cycles, we find one unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, (4, 2), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Since we found one unique chordal 4-cycle, the final count is [1].
