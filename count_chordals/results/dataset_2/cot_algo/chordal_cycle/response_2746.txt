Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

- Cycle 1: (0, 2, 1, 5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 2, 4, 3, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 4, 3, 0)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 4, 2, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 2, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 6: (3, 4, 2, 7, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 4, 6, 8, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 6, 8, 9, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 9, 8, 6, 4)
- Cycle 10: (5, 4, 6, 3, 5)
- Cycle 11: (5, 4, 9, 8, 5)
- Cycle 12: (6, 8, 7, 3, 6)
- Cycle 13: (7, 8, 9, 4, 7)
- Cycle 14: (8, 6, 4, 2, 8)
- Cycle 15: (8, 6, 3, 7, 8)
- Cycle 16: (9, 8, 6, 4, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 

- <0, (1, 2), 5> has one chord (1, 2)
- <0, (3, 4), 5> has one chord (3, 4)
- <1, (2, 4), 5> has one chord (2, 4)
- <3, (6, 8), 4> has one chord (6, 8)
- <4, (6, 8), 9> has one chord (6, 8)
- <5, (6, 8), 4> has one chord (6, 8)
- <6, (7, 3), 8> has one chord (7, 3)
- <7, (8, 9), 4> has one chord (8, 9)
- <8, (6, 2), 4> has one chord (6, 2)
- <9, (6, 8), 4> has one chord (6, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found. 

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
