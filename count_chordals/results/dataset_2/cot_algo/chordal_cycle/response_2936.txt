Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 4) (9, 3) (26, 1) (26, 0) (3, 9) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 5) (0, 26) (0, 27) (0, 17) (27, 0) (27, 17) (2, 6) (2, 14) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 14) (29, 4) (20, 25) (20, 13) (20, 18) (20, 5) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 4) (11, 16) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 28) (1, 26) (1, 15) (1, 11) (21, 28) (21, 4) (8, 5) (8, 24) (8, 18) (23, 18) (23, 12) (28, 16) (28, 21) (28, 22) (28, 10) (19, 3) (19, 24) (22, 3) (22, 28) (22, 17) (7, 29) (7, 17) (24, 8) (24, 19) (5, 15) (5, 20) (5, 8) (5, 14) (18, 20) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 6) (4, 9) (4, 29) (4, 25) (4, 21) (4, 17) (12, 23) (12, 14) (13, 29) (13, 20) (6, 2) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 10) (10, 28) (10, 6) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 22) (17, 7) (17, 4) (14, 2) (14, 29) (14, 5) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles in the graph of length 4 or more. We will list all of them:

1. Cycle 1: 9 - 3 - 15 - 25 - 9
2. Cycle 2: 26 - 0 - 27 - 17 - 26
3. Cycle 3: 2 - 6 - 25 - 15 - 2
4. Cycle 4: 29 - 7 - 17 - 27 - 29
5. Cycle 5: 11 - 1 - 26 - 0 - 11
6. Cycle 6: 8 - 5 - 15 - 1 - 8
7. Cycle 7: 23 - 18 - 20 - 25 - 23
8. Cycle 8: 11 - 1 - 15 - 3 - 11
9. Cycle 9: 8 - 5 - 20 - 13 - 8
10. Cycle 10: 26 - 1 - 11 - 16 - 26
11. Cycle 11: 28 - 16 - 11 - 1 - 28
12. Cycle 12: 4 - 29 - 14 - 2 - 4
13. Cycle 13: 12 - 23 - 18 - 14 - 12
14. Cycle 14: 6 - 25 - 20 - 13 - 6
15. Cycle 15: 10 - 28 - 21 - 4 - 10

Step 2:
We will check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has chord <3, 25>
- Cycle 2 has chord <0, 27>
- Cycle 3 has chord <6, 15>
- Cycle 4 has chord <7, 27>
- Cycle 5 has chord <1, 26>
- Cycle 6 has chord <5, 15>
- Cycle 7 has chord <18, 25>
- Cycle 8 has chord <1, 15>
- Cycle 9 has chord <5, 20>
- Cycle 10 has chord <1, 16>
- Cycle 11 has chord <1, 16>
- Cycle 12 has chord <2, 14>
- Cycle 13 has chord <18, 23>
- Cycle 14 has chord <6, 20>
- Cycle 15 has chord <4, 21>

Step 3:
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find that there are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
