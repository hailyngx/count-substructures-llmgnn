Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-4-1-3-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-5-8-6-0
        - Cycle 3: 1-3-4-0-1
        - Cycle 4: 2-5-8-0-2
        - Cycle 5: 2-6-7-8-2
        - Cycle 6: 2-7-9-1-2
        - Cycle 7: 3-4-1-9-3
        - Cycle 8: 5-6-7-2-5
        - Cycle 9: 5-8-9-7-5

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Cycle <0, (3, 1), 4, 0>
        - Cycle <0, (8, 6), 5, 0>
        - Cycle <1, (4, 9), 3, 1>
        - Cycle <2, (5, 8), 0, 2>
        - Cycle <2, (7, 1), 9, 2>
        - Cycle <2, (6, 8), 5, 2>
        - Cycle <3, (1, 9), 4, 3>
        - Cycle <5, (7, 2), 6, 5>
        - Cycle <5, (9, 7), 8, 5>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are [9] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

        The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        <0, (3, 1), 4, 0>
        <0, (8, 6), 5, 0>
        <1, (4, 9), 3, 1>
        <2, (5, 8), 0, 2>
        <2, (7, 1), 9, 2>
        <2, (6, 8), 5, 2>
        <3, (1, 9), 4, 3>
        <5, (7, 2), 6, 5>
        <5, (9, 7), 8, 5>
