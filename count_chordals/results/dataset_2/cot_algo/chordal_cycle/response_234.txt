Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- (3, 5, 2, 6, 3)
- (3, 5, 2, 8, 3)
- (3, 6, 8, 2, 3)
- (3, 6, 8, 3, 4)
- (3, 6, 7, 4, 3)
- (3, 7, 4, 0, 3)
- (3, 7, 4, 1, 3)
- (3, 1, 9, 7, 3)
- (4, 0, 9, 5, 4)
- (4, 0, 5, 2, 4)
- (4, 1, 9, 7, 4)
- (4, 1, 3, 5, 4)
- (5, 3, 7, 9, 5)
- (5, 2, 8, 6, 5)
- (5, 0, 4, 1, 5)
- (6, 3, 1, 9, 6)
- (6, 2, 8, 3, 6)
- (7, 4, 1, 9, 7)
- (7, 4, 0, 9, 7)
- (8, 2, 5, 0, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, 5, 2, 6, 3> has exactly one chord (5, 6): <3, (5, 6), 2, 6, 3>
- <3, 6, 8, 2, 3> has exactly one chord (6, 8): <3, 6, (6, 8), 2, 3>
- <3, 7, 4, 1, 3> has exactly one chord (7, 1): <3, 7, (7, 1), 4, 3>
- <4, 0, 9, 5, 4> has exactly one chord (0, 5): <4, (0, 5), 9, 5, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [4]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <3, (5, 6), 2, 6, 3>
- <3, 6, (6, 8), 2, 3>
- <3, 7, (7, 1), 4, 3>
- <4, (0, 5), 9, 5, 4>
