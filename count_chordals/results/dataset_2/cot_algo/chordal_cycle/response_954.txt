Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 13) (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 2) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 14, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 8, 0, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 1, 3, 13, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 2, 12, 1, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 4, 14, 0, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 8, 0, 13, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 1, 3, 11, 9)
- Cycle 8: (1, 3, 13, 0, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 11, 14, 4, 1)
- Cycle 10: (3, 13, 0, 6, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 11, 14, 2, 3)
- Cycle 12: (8, 0, 13, 2, 8)
- Cycle 13: (10, 6, 7, 3, 10)
- Cycle 14: (11, 1, 12, 6, 11)
- Cycle 15: (11, 14, 0, 7, 11)
- Cycle 16: (4, 2, 12, 6, 4)
- Cycle 17: (6, 10, 13, 0, 6)
- Cycle 18: (6, 7, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 19: (7, 12, 2, 14, 7)
- Cycle 20: (12, 6, 10, 13, 12)
- Cycle 21: (0, 9, 5, 1, 0)
- Cycle 22: (0, 13, 3, 7, 0)
- Cycle 23: (0, 6, 7, 12, 0)
- Cycle 24: (0, 14, 4, 9, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycles with exactly one chord are: 
    <1, (4, 9), 5)>
    <2, (5, 8), 9)>
    <3, (9, 5), 1)>
    <4, (12, 1), 5)>
    <5, (0, 9), 4)>
    <6, (9, 13), 8)>
    <7, (3, 9), 1)>
    <8, (0, 1), 3)>
    <9, (4, 14), 0)>
    <10, (6, 0), 3)>
    <11, (3, 14), 11)>
    <12, (13, 8), 0)>
    <13, (10, 3), 6)>
    <14, (11, 1), 12)>
    <15, (7, 0), 11)>
    <16, (2, 6), 4)>
    <17, (0, 10), 6)>
    <18, (1, 7), 3)>
    <19, (2, 14), 7)>
    <20, (13, 12), 10)>
    <21, (1, 5), 9)>
    <22, (0, 13), 3)>
    <23, (7, 12), 0)>
    <24, (4, 9), 0)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 24 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final answer is [24].
