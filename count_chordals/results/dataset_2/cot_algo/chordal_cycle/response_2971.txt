Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 12) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 25) (15, 28) (15, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 20) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 22) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 29) (12, 26) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 25) (29, 8) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 21) (21, 29) (21, 13) (21, 5) (21, 18) (28, 15) (28, 18) (0, 7) (0, 10) (20, 4) (20, 11) (20, 10) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 20) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 11) (13, 24) (13, 19) (19, 13) (19, 24) (19, 6) (23, 24) (23, 27) (16, 26) (16, 1) (14, 26) (14, 5) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 1) (11, 20) (11, 13) (11, 6) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 23) (1, 16) (1, 25) (1, 2) (1, 22) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 1) (18, 8) (18, 21) (18, 28) (22, 8) (22, 1) (5, 21) (5, 14) (27, 3) (27, 23) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (15, 3, 2, 1, 25, 15)
- Cycle 2: (8, 4, 12, 10, 0, 7, 29, 17, 25, 1, 2, 3, 15, 10, 12, 7, 29, 21, 18, 8)
- Cycle 3: (13, 17, 29, 21, 18, 28, 15, 25, 17, 13, 11, 20, 10, 15)
- Cycle 4: (24, 13, 17, 29, 21, 5, 14, 26, 12, 4, 20, 11, 6, 19, 24)
- Cycle 5: (2, 3, 15, 25, 17, 29, 7, 12, 4, 8, 6, 19, 24, 23, 27, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 8).
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (15, 18).
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (4, 13).
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (7, 12).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 1 chordless cycle, so the final answer is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <<8, (1, 25)>>
