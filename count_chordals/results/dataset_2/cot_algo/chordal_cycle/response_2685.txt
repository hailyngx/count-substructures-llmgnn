Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 0) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 16) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (13, 5) (13, 17) (15, 1) (15, 4) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 16) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 19) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 17) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 12, 10, 3, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 12, 10, 11, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 12, 10, 14, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 15, 4, 14, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 10, 14, 4, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 10, 11, 0, 3)
- Cycle 7: (4, 14, 10, 12, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 14, 10, 11, 4)
- Cycle 9: (5, 17, 16, 3, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 17, 13, 5)
- Cycle 11: (6, 8, 5, 17, 6)
- Cycle 12: (9, 12, 1, 15, 9)
- Cycle 13: (9, 12, 10, 14, 9)
- Cycle 14: (11, 0, 2, 16, 11)
- Cycle 15: (16, 2, 7, 2, 16)
- Cycle 16: (16, 2, 0, 11, 16)
- Cycle 17: (16, 17, 5, 8, 16)
- Cycle 18: (16, 17, 13, 5, 16)
- Cycle 19: (16, 17, 13, 17, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <1, (12, 10), 3, 1>
- <1, (12, 10), 11, 1>
- <1, (12, 10), 14, 1>
- <1, (15, 4), 14, 1>
- <3, (10, 14), 4, 3>
- <10, (14, 12), 1, 10>
- <10, (14, 11), 4, 10>
- <5, (17, 16), 3, 5>
- <5, 17, 13, 5>
- <6, (8, 5), 17, 6>
- <9, (12, 1), 15, 9>
- <9, (12, 10), 14, 9>
- <11, 0, (2, 16), 11>
- <16, 2, (7, 2), 16>
- <16, (2, 0), 11, 16>
- <16, 17, 5, 8, 16>
- <16, 17, 13, 5, 16>
- <16, (17, 13), 17, 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordal 4-cycles found. Hence, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
