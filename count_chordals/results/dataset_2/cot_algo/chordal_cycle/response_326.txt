Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 5, 6, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 3, 6, 8, 4)
- Cycle 3: (7, 9, 2, 3, 7)
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 1, 8, 5)
- Cycle 5: (6, 4, 3, 0, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1: Chord (7, 5) -> <1, (7, 5), 6, 4>
- Cycle 2: Chord (3, 8) -> <2, (3, 8), 6, 4>
- Cycle 3: Chord (9, 2) -> <3, (9, 2), 3, 7>
- Cycle 4: Chord (1, 8) -> <4, (1, 8), 5, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- There are 1 chordless cycle: (5, 6, 1, 8, 5)

Putting this final number inside brackets, the answer is [1].
