Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 7, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 2, 9, 3, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 4, 8, 7, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 2, 3, 7, 0, 9)
- Cycle 5: (4, 6, 2, 3, 8, 4)
- Cycle 6: (7, 1, 2, 3, 8, 7)
- Cycle 7: (8, 4, 0, 9, 2, 8)
- Cycle 8: (0, 7, 1, 5, 6, 0)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (5, 7), 3>
- <2, (1, 9), 3>
- <3, (4, 8), 7>
- <4, (2, 3), 6>
- <5, (1, 7), 3>
- <6, (0, 8), 7>
- <7, (0, 2), 8>
- <8, (5, 6), 0>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]
