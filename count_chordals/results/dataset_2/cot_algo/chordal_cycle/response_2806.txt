Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 8) (13, 21) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 7) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 19) (2, 27) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 0) (29, 3) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 6) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 8) (20, 22) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 12) (20, 24) (25, 20) (25, 14) (3, 29) (3, 17) (3, 27) (8, 13) (8, 21) (8, 24) (8, 17) (6, 7) (6, 18) (28, 2) (28, 4) (10, 9) (15, 26) (15, 11) (4, 28) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 20) (12, 4) (12, 0) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 15) (26, 11) (16, 5) (16, 9) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 11) (14, 25) (24, 20) (24, 8) (24, 27) (24, 19) (19, 9) (19, 24) (19, 1) (19, 27) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 24) (27, 19) (1, 19) (1, 23) (1, 0) (23, 21) (23, 1) (11, 15) (11, 4) (11, 26) (11, 17) (11, 18) (18, 6) (18, 11) (0, 22) (0, 2) (0, 29) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (13, 8, 21, 7, 22, 20, 26, 5, 9, 16)
- Cycle 2: (2, 0, 29, 3, 27)
- Cycle 3: (21, 23, 1, 19, 24, 20, 22)
- Cycle 4: (4, 28, 2, 0, 12)
- Cycle 5: (11, 15, 26, 20, 22)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (13, 21), 4, 5> - Chord: (13, 21)
- <2, (6, 22), 0, 1> - Chord: (6, 22)
- <3, (16, 9), 20, 26> - Chord: (16, 9)
- <4, (0, 29), 3, 2> - Chord: (0, 29)
- <5, (20, 22), 26, 15> - Chord: (20, 22)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
