Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 4) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 10) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 11) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 0-9-4-14-0
- Cycle 2: 0-13-12-5-4-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (0, 4)
- Cycle 2 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, 4, 9, 14>
