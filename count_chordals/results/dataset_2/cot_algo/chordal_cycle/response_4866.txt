Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 4-9-5-3-4
- Cycle 2: 1-9-5-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-9-7-3-1
- Cycle 4: 1-4-8-6-1
- Cycle 5: 3-7-9-6-3
- Cycle 6: 2-5-9-1-2
- Cycle 7: 2-5-3-0-2
- Cycle 8: 0-6-8-4-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (5, 1)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (5, 3)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (6, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
- <4, 9, 5, 3, (9, 3)>
- <1, 9, 5, 2, (9, 5)>
- <1, 9, 7, 3, (9, 3)>
- <1, 4, 8, 6, (4, 8)>
- <3, 7, 9, 6, (9, 6)>
- <2, 5, 9, 1, (5, 1)>
- <2, 5, 3, 0, (5, 3)>
- <0, 6, 8, 4, (6, 8)>
