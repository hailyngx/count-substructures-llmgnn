Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 20) (22, 18) (22, 5) (22, 25) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 26) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 26) (10, 2) (17, 8) (17, 10) (4, 24) (4, 28) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 20) (26, 25) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 28) (15, 11) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 21) (0, 9) (0, 21) (0, 24) (0, 23) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 20) (7, 16) (25, 22) (25, 26) (25, 21) (3, 8) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 29) (28, 4) (28, 15) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 5) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 2) (24, 4) (24, 0) (24, 5) (24, 23) (1, 19) (1, 12) (29, 3) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 16) (20, 3) (20, 19) (21, 9) (21, 0) (21, 25) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 6) (19, 1) (19, 20) (19, 2) (6, 11) (6, 2) (14, 28) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 24) (23, 0) (23, 24) (23, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 8-13-26-25-22-5-28-4-24-0-9-18-22-25-26-10-17-8
- Cycle 2: 15-28-4-24-0-9-18-22-25-26-20-16-7-16-8-17-10-15
- Cycle 3: 26-25-22-18-20-19-2-11-15-28-3-29-3-8-17-10
- Cycle 4: 15-10-17-8-16-20-3-29-3-28-14-28-5-24-0-21-25

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (8, 26)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (15, 16)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (26, 10)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (15, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
