26. (0, 17, 2, 1, 15, 12, 0)
27. (7, 0, 13, 1, 3, 8, 7)
28. (15, 1, 9, 1, 3, 13, 15)
29. (8, 3, 13, 1, 15, 12, 8)
30. (8, 6, 1, 15, 12, 5, 8)
31. (8, 17, 0, 6, 5, 12, 8)
32. (9, 1, 3, 8, 6, 5, 9)
33. (10, 5, 13, 1, 15, 12, 10)
34. (10, 15, 1, 3, 8, 17, 10)
35. (10, 19, 3, 8, 6, 5, 10)
36. (4, 17, 0, 7, 6, 5, 4)
37. (16, 18, 11, 2, 1, 13, 16)
38. (16, 14, 13, 1, 3, 8, 16)
39. (18, 16, 14, 13, 1, 3, 18)
40. (18, 11, 2, 1, 15, 12, 18)
41. (19, 3, 1, 15, 12, 5, 19)
42. (14, 13, 1, 15, 12, 5, 14)
43. (2, 1, 15, 12, 5, 13, 2)
44. (2, 16, 14, 13, 1, 3, 2)
45. (2, 17, 0, 6, 8, 3, 2)
46. (11, 18, 16, 14, 13, 1, 11)

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles among them are:
1. <1, (9), 3, 13, 1>
2. <1, (15), 12, 5, 13, 1>
3. <3, (8), 6, 1, 9, 3>
4. <5, (12), 15, 1, 3, 13, 5>
5. <6, (8), 3, 1, 15, 12, 6>
6. <0, (17), 2, 1, 15, 12, 0>
7. <4, (17), 0, 7, 6, 5, 4>
8. <16, (14), 13, 1, 3, 8, 16>
9. <18, (11), 2, 1, 15, 12, 18>

Step 3:
There are 9 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [9].
