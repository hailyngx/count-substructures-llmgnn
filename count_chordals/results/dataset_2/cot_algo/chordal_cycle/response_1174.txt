Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (6, 5, 4, 6)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 4, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (9, 4), forming a chordal 4-cycle: <1, (9, 4), 5>
- Cycle 2 has no chords and is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 has no chords and is not a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
