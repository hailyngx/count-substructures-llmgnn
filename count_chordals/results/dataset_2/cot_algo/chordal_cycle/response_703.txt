Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 23) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 3) (21, 23) (21, 17) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 14) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 25) (12, 11) (27, 4) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 17) (17, 21) (17, 27) (17, 0) (29, 22) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 26) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 22) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 11) (22, 29) (22, 8) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 0) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 28) (11, 5) (13, 26) (13, 19) (26, 2) (26, 13) (26, 6) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 24) (10, 5) (15, 9) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 13) (28, 11) (28, 18) (28, 5) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 28) (5, 25) (20, 16) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 16) (6, 26) (6, 10) (6, 18) (24, 7) (24, 10) (18, 10) (18, 28) (18, 6) (25, 12) (25, 5) (16, 14) (16, 20) (16, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <1, 12, 27, 4>
- <1, 12, 27, 3>
- <1, 12, 25, 5>
- <1, 19, 8, 2>
- <21, 17, 0, 3>
- <21, 17, 27, 3>
- <4, 7, 0, 3>
- <4, 7, 14, 0>
- <4, 7, 14, 16>
- <4, 27, 12, 11>
- <2, 8, 19, 1>
- <2, 8, 22, 29>
- <7, 0, 17, 27>
- <7, 14, 16, 20>
- <7, 14, 16, 23>
- <12, 27, 17, 21>
- <12, 25, 5, 11>
- <17, 21, 23, 1>
- <17, 27, 12, 11>
- <14, 7, 0, 17>
- <14, 7, 27, 17>
- <14, 0, 17, 21>
- <14, 0, 3, 27>
- <8, 19, 1, 12>
- <8, 22, 29, 18>
- <0, 7, 4, 27>
- <0, 17, 27, 3>
- <0, 3, 27, 12>
- <14, 0, 3, 27>

Step 2: Identify the chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 12, 27, 4> (Chord: 12-27)
- <1, 12, 25, 5> (Chord: 12-25)
- <2, 8, 19, 1> (Chord: 8-19)
- <21, 17, 0, 3> (Chord: 17-0)
- <4, 7, 0, 3> (Chord: 7-0)
- <7, 0, 17, 27> (Chord: 0-17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
