Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 7) (2, 18) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 1) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 8) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 9) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 4) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 16) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 16) (17, 13) (17, 16) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 19) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 17) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 12) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 7) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 12) (6, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 7, 18, 2, 15, 0, 7)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 18, 7, 0, 15, 2, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 3, 11, 19, 12, 4, 1, 5)
  
Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (7, 18).  
So, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (7, 18), 2)>.

Step 3:
Since there is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
