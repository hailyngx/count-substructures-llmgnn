Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 18) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 12) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 4) (5, 19) (5, 4) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 16) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (13, 14) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 0) (16, 15) (16, 19) (16, 18) (16, 13) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 13) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 1-10-17-18-1
- Cycle 2: 1-2-8-15-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-5-19-1
- Cycle 4: 1-4-6-7-1
- Cycle 5: 1-4-0-12-1
- Cycle 6: 2-8-15-16-2
- Cycle 7: 2-14-18-16-2
- Cycle 8: 3-7-6-4-3
- Cycle 9: 3-7-6-11-3
- Cycle 10: 3-19-5-4-3
- Cycle 11: 3-19-16-18-3
- Cycle 12: 10-1-4-6-10
- Cycle 13: 10-17-18-16-10
- Cycle 14: 14-3-7-6-14
- Cycle 15: 14-2-8-12-14
- Cycle 16: 14-10-1-2-14
- Cycle 17: 14-18-16-13-14
- Cycle 18: 16-15-8-2-16
- Cycle 19: 16-18-17-11-16
- Cycle 20: 16-18-14-2-16

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <2, 15, 8>
- Cycle 10 has a chord: <3, 4, 5>
- Cycle 13 has a chord: <10, 18, 17>
- Cycle 16 has a chord: <14, 2, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 16 chordless cycles found.

Final answer: [16]
