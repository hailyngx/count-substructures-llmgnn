Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 18) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (0, 20) (0, 29) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 6) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 15) (18, 21) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 17) (18, 29) (28, 22) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (26, 12) (26, 17) (6, 21) (6, 20) (6, 4) (6, 25) (8, 14) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 27) (16, 9) (16, 24) (16, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 23) (14, 24) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 25) (19, 25) (19, 23) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 27) (5, 2) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 24) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 14) (24, 5) (22, 28) (22, 5) (17, 18) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 12) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 15) (25, 19) (29, 0) (29, 18) (29, 5) (10, 13) (12, 11) (12, 26) (12, 17) (23, 7) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 27) (27, 20) (27, 9) (27, 2) (27, 23) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are multiple cycles in the graph, but we are interested in cycles of length 4. We find the following cycles:
- Cycle 1: 7 - 21 - 6 - 25 - 7
- Cycle 2: 1 - 3 - 13 - 11 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 25 - 6 - 20 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 9 - 27 - 23 - 1
- Cycle 5: 4 - 18 - 21 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 6: 4 - 15 - 9 - 27 - 4
- Cycle 7: 18 - 24 - 5 - 29 - 18
- Cycle 8: 14 - 23 - 19 - 25 - 14
- Cycle 9: 16 - 24 - 5 - 29 - 16
- Cycle 10: 17 - 26 - 12 - 11 - 17
- Cycle 11: 17 - 12 - 26 - 16 - 17
- Cycle 12: 25 - 6 - 20 - 27 - 25
- Cycle 13: 27 - 23 - 7 - 21 - 27
- Cycle 14: 13 - 11 - 14 - 23 - 13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Among these cycles, we find that only cycle 5: <4, 18, 21, 6> has exactly one chord: (4, 6).
Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, 18, 21, 6> with a chord (4, 6).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since we found only one chordal 4-cycle, the number of chordless cycles is [13].
