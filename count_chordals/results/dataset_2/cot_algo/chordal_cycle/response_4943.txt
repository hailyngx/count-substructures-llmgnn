Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 16) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 18) (6, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 9) (8, 3) (8, 19) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 16) (0, 16) (0, 9) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 0) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 13, 4)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 6, 18)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 13, 17)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 6, 18, 9)
- Cycle 5: (1, 5, 13, 17, 16)
- Cycle 6: (1, 5, 6, 18, 9, 0)
- Cycle 7: (1, 10, 2, 18)
- Cycle 8: (1, 10, 2, 18, 9)
- Cycle 9: (1, 10, 2, 18, 6)
- Cycle 10: (1, 10, 2, 18, 9, 0)
- Cycle 11: (1, 10, 2, 18, 6, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (5, 13), 4>
- <1, (5, 6), 18>
- <1, (5, 13), 17>
- <1, (5, 6), 18, 9>
- <1, (5, 13), 17, 16>
- <1, (5, 6), 18, 9, 0>
- <1, (10, 2), 18>
- <1, (10, 2), 18, 9>
- <1, (10, 2), 18, 6>
- <1, (10, 2), 18, 9, 0>
- <1, (10, 2), 18, 6, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
