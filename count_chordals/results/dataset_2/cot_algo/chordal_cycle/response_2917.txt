Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-5-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-9-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-7-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-6-8-5-0
- Cycle 5: 1-2-9-3-1
- Cycle 6: 2-4-6-8-2
- Cycle 7: 2-7-4-0-2
- Cycle 8: 3-9-5-1-3
- Cycle 9: 5-8-6-4-5
- Cycle 10: 7-2-6-4-7

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 1-8
- Cycle 2 has a chord 3-9
- Cycle 3 has a chord 4-7
- Cycle 4 has a chord 5-8
- Cycle 5 has a chord 2-9
- Cycle 6 has a chord 4-6
- Cycle 7 has a chord 2-4
- Cycle 8 has a chord 1-3
- Cycle 9 has a chord 4-6
- Cycle 10 has a chord 2-6

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have 10 cycles with exactly one chord:
Therefore, the final count is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (1-8), 5>
<2, (3-9), 0>
<3, (4-7), 0>
<4, (5-8), 0>
<5, (2-9), 1>
<6, (4-6), 2>
<7, (2-4), 0>
<8, (1-3), 9>
<9, (4-6), 0>
<10, (2-6), 7>
