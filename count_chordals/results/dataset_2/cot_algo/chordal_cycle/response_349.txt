Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 18) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 22) (27, 18) (8, 13) (8, 20) (8, 25) (13, 8) (13, 23) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 23) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 19) (12, 9) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 26) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 15) (28, 17) (28, 1) (28, 4) (26, 17) (26, 10) (3, 16) (3, 23) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 20) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 19) (21, 10) (21, 25) (18, 0) (18, 27) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 16) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 15) (25, 27) (25, 8) (25, 21) (25, 22) (10, 26) (10, 21) (10, 2) (10, 14) (4, 28) (4, 11) (24, 5) (24, 2) (24, 23) (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 23) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 24) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 19) (14, 6) (14, 10) (9, 12) (22, 27) (22, 25) (22, 20) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 20) (20, 8) (20, 11) (20, 22) (20, 16) (23, 13) (23, 7) (23, 3) (23, 24) (23, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. Here are some of them:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 27 - 25 - 22 - 0
- Cycle 2: 7 - 12 - 9 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 3: 17 - 29 - 15 - 19 - 17
- Cycle 4: 4 - 28 - 1 - 23 - 4

Step 2:
Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <0, (25, 22), 27>
- Cycle 2: <7, (9, 6), 12>
- Cycle 3: <17, (15, 19), 29>
- Cycle 4: <4, (1, 23), 28>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is a total of [4] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
