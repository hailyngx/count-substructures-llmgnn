Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 12) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph: 
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 10, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (3, 10, 14, 2, 3)
- Cycle 3: (10, 11, 8, 7, 10)
- Cycle 4: (4, 13, 2, 5, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 14, 0, 5)
- Cycle 6: (0, 12, 4, 13, 2, 0)
- Cycle 7: (14, 1, 5, 0, 14)
- Cycle 8: (11, 9, 7, 8, 11)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (3, 5) making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (3, 5)>
