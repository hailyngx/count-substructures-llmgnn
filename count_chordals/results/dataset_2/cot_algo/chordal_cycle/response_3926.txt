Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 18) (10, 16) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 2) (13, 19) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 15) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 19) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 15) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 15) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (16, 10) (16, 19) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (7, 4, 7)
- Cycle 2: (7, 0, 1, 11, 2, 8, 2, 11, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 3: (7, 0, 11, 2, 8, 2, 11, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 4: (7, 15, 5, 3, 1, 11, 2, 8, 2, 11, 1, 3, 5, 15, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 9, 6, 3, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 6: (11, 14, 6, 3, 1, 0, 11)
- Cycle 7: (6, 14, 11, 2, 8, 2, 11, 14, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 13, 19, 16, 10, 16, 19, 12, 5, 15, 18, 17, 18, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 9, 7, 15, 5, 12, 19, 16, 10, 16, 19, 12, 5, 3, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 18, 17, 18, 15, 5, 3, 1, 0, 11, 14, 6)
- Cycle 11: (15, 5, 3, 1, 0, 11, 14, 6, 13, 19, 12, 5, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 14, 11, 2> (Chord: 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordless cycles: [10]
