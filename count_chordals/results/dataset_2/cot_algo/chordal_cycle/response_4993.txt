Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 16) (7, 21) (7, 23) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 27) (21, 12) (21, 25) (10, 17) (10, 4) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 26) (18, 0) (18, 8) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 6) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 12) (22, 25) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 23) (3, 19) (26, 18) (26, 12) (6, 8) (6, 27) (24, 29) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 23) (29, 24) (29, 1) (0, 18) (0, 3) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 14) (25, 21) (25, 22) (20, 27) (20, 4) (20, 23) (20, 28) (19, 2) (19, 3) (27, 21) (27, 6) (27, 20) (12, 21) (12, 22) (12, 26) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 28) (13, 14) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 22) (14, 5) (14, 16) (14, 13) (4, 10) (4, 20) (15, 17) (23, 7) (23, 3) (23, 1) (23, 20) (28, 20) (28, 13) 

Response:
[4]

<5, 9, 22, 11>
Step 1: (5, 9, 22, 11)
Step 2: (5, 22) is a chord.
Step 3: Chordal 4-cycle found: <5, 9, 22, 11> with chord (5, 22).
