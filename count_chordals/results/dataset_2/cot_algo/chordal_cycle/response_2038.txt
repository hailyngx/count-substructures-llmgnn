19. <5, 11, 15, 21, 4>
20. <5, 11, 22, 20, 0>
21. <5, 11, 22, 1, 9>
22. <5, 23, 2, 7, 14>
23. <5, 23, 17, 22, 1>
24. <5, 23, 17, 13, 28>
25. <5, 25, 4, 18, 9>
26. <5, 25, 16, 8, 5>
27. <6, 29, 23, 2, 7>
28. <7, 14, 20, 0, 18>
29. <9, 0, 20, 14, 10>
30. <10, 14, 7, 22, 1>
31. <11, 5, 25, 16, 8>
32. <13, 28, 27, 3, 10>
33. <13, 28, 27, 29, 6>
34. <17, 22, 1, 9, 0>
35. <19, 18, 0, 20, 14>
36. <19, 24, 13, 28, 27>
37. <21, 15, 11, 22, 20>
38. <23, 29, 27, 3, 10>
39. <24, 19, 18, 4, 21>

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 18, 19, 24, 22> (18, 24)
- <3, 12, 16, 25, 5> (12, 25)
- <3, 27, 29, 28, 13> (27, 28)
- <5, 11, 22, 20, 0> (11, 20)
- <5, 23, 17, 13, 28> (23, 13)
- <5, 23, 17, 22, 1> (23, 22)
- <9, 0, 20, 14, 10> (0, 20)
- <10, 14, 7, 22, 1> (14, 22)
- <17, 22, 1, 9, 0> (22, 9)
- <19, 24, 13, 28, 27> (24, 28)

Step 3:
Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles, there are [10] such cycles.
