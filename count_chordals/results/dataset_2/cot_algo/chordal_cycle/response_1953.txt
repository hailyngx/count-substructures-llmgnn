Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-3-9-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-2-9-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-8-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-0-4-1
- Cycle 5: 1-3-9-2-1
- Cycle 6: 3-5-8-7-3
- Cycle 7: 3-1-6-0-3
- Cycle 8: 3-1-9-2-3
- Cycle 9: 5-8-6-0-5
- Cycle 10: 5-4-0-6-5
- Cycle 11: 5-8-7-3-5
- Cycle 12: 9-6-0-4-9
- Cycle 13: 9-1-6-8-9
- Cycle 14: 9-3-7-8-9
- Cycle 15: 4-8-7-3-4

Step 2:
Only Cycle 6: 3-5-8-7-3 has exactly one chord, which is (5, 7).

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle is <3, (5, 7), 8>.
