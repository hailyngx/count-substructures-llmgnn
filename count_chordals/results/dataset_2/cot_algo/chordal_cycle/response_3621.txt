Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1 - 9 - 4 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 2: 3 - 1 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 3: 7 - 1 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 4: 7 - 1 - 3 - 7
- Cycle 5: 2 - 7 - 0 - 2
- Cycle 6: 5 - 4 - 9 - 5

Step 2:
Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 9, (2, 4), 1>
- <3, 1, (5, 3), 3>
- <7, 1, (2, 7), 7>
- <7, 1, (3, 7), 7>
- <2, 7, (0, 2), 2>
- <5, 4, (9, 5), 4>

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]
