Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-3-9-1-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-6-8-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-7-3-5-0
- Cycle 4: 1-4-7-3-9-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-8-7-2-1
- Cycle 6: 2-7-4-1-9-2
- Cycle 7: 0-8-6-4-7-0
- Cycle 8: 3-5-7-2-8-3
- Cycle 9: 4-6-1-9-7-4
- Cycle 10: 3-7-4-6-8-3
- Cycle 11: 0-3-9-1-4-0
- Cycle 12: 0-8-2-7-3-0
- Cycle 13: 1-9-8-6-4-1
- Cycle 14: 5-3-7-4-0-5

Step 2: Check cycles for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 3, 5, 7, 2, 8, 0> (Chord: (3, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 4, 1, 9, 7, 4, 0> (Chord: (1, 7))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final result is [2].
