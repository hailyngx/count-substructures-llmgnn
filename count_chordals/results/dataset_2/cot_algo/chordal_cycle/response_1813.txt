Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 15) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (18, 6) (19, 3) (19, 14) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 11) (0, 8) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (7, 1) (7, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 9) (8, 0) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 17) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 13) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 5, 16, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 11, 5, 6, 15>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 12, 4, 10>
- Cycle 4: <2, 11, 0, 8, 5>
- Cycle 5: <3, 12, 2, 11, 0>
- Cycle 6: <4, 10, 16, 5, 11>
- Cycle 7: <5, 16, 4, 12, 2>
- Cycle 8: <6, 15, 4, 12, 2>
- Cycle 9: <9, 14, 3, 12, 4>
- Cycle 10: <11, 0, 8, 5, 11>
- Cycle 11: <13, 6, 15, 4, 12>
- Cycle 12: <13, 11, 2, 12, 4>
- Cycle 13: <13, 11, 2, 5, 16>
- Cycle 14: <13, 7, 1, 10, 16>
- Cycle 15: <13, 11, 5, 6, 15>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Only Cycle 1: <0, 11, 5, 16, 4> has exactly one chord (11, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the answer is [1]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 11, 5, 16, 4> with chord (11, 5).
