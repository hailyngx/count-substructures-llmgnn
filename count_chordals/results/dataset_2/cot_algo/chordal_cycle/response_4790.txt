Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, 14, 13, 1, 10>  
- <0, 14, 6, 4, 10>  
- <0, 3, 2, 1, 10>  
- <0, 3, 11, 12, 4>  
- <0, 6, 4, 12, 1>  
- <5, 2, 3, 11, 9>  
- <5, 2, 1, 10, 4>  
- <5, 7, 14, 12, 9>  
- <5, 8, 10, 1, 13>  
- <9, 8, 10, 1, 13>  
- <9, 11, 3, 0, 14>  
- <9, 11, 10, 1, 13>  
- <10, 7, 14, 13, 1>  
- <11, 3, 0, 14, 13>  
- <11, 12, 4, 6, 14>  
- <12, 9, 8, 10, 1>  
- <12, 11, 3, 0, 14>  
- <12, 14, 0, 3, 11>  
- <1, 10, 4, 12, 9>  
- <6, 4, 12, 14, 7>  
- <2, 5, 8, 10, 7>  
- <2, 7, 14, 13, 1>  

Step 2:
From the above list, the chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are:
- <0, 14, 13, 1, 10> with chord (14, 1)  
- <5, 2, 3, 11, 9> with chord (2, 11)  
- <9, 8, 10, 1, 13> with chord (8, 1)  
- <10, 7, 14, 13, 1> with chord (7, 13)  

Step 3:
So, the number of chordless cycles found is [22].
