Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 3) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (1, 13, 10, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 6, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 8, 4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 14, 13, 7, 3)
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 6, 3, 4)
- Cycle 6: (8, 14, 13, 7, 8)
- Cycle 7: (9, 10, 13, 7, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (13, 10), 4, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
