Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 4-7-5-1-4
        - Cycle 2: 4-9-2-3-4
        - Cycle 3: 4-1-0-6-4
        - Cycle 4: 4-3-2-9-4
        - Cycle 5: 7-5-0-6-7
        - Cycle 6: 7-3-2-8-7
        - Cycle 7: 6-9-2-8-6
        - Cycle 8: 6-1-0-5-6
        - Cycle 9: 9-2-3-0-9
        - Cycle 10: 0-6-8-2-0
        - Cycle 11: 0-1-5-7-0
        (Note: Listing more cycles is redundant and not required for this question)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Observing the cycles, we can see that Cycle 11 (0-1-5-7-0) has exactly one chord (1, 5) connecting non-adjacent nodes 1 and 5.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There is one chordless 4-cycle found.

Final answer: [1]
Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 1, 5, 7>
