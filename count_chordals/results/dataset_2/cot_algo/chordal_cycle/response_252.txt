Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-2-9-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-3-5-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-3-7-0

Step 2: 
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, 1, 3, 5>
