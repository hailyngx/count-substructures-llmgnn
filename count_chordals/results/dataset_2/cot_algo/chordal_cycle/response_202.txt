Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (2, 18) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 18) (13, 1) (17, 11) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 0) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (15, 2) (15, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1: 11 - 16 - 7 - 18 - 11
2. Cycle 2: 11 - 0 - 16 - 12 - 11
3. Cycle 3: 11 - 18 - 2 - 3 - 11
4. Cycle 4: 11 - 17 - 11 - 18 - 11
5. Cycle 5: 16 - 7 - 18 - 2 - 16
6. Cycle 6: 16 - 0 - 10 - 6 - 16
7. Cycle 7: 11 - 18 - 7 - 19 - 11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- In Cycle 1: 11 - 16 - 7 - 18 - 11, the chord is (16, 18).
- In Cycle 4: 11 - 17 - 11 - 18 - 11, the chord is (17, 18).
- In Cycle 6: 16 - 0 - 10 - 6 - 16, the chord is (0, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, we found 4 chordal 4-cycles.

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (16, 18), 7, 11)>
<2, (17, 18), 11, 11)>
<3, (0, 10), 6, 16)>
<4, (7, 19), 11, 18)>

Therefore, the final count is [4].
