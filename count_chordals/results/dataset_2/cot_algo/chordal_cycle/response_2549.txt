Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 10) (15, 27) (15, 12) (15, 24) (15, 16) (27, 15) (27, 8) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 29) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 11) (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 9) (21, 18) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 23) (20, 28) (1, 17) (1, 26) (1, 5) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 8) (26, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 27) (8, 14) (8, 26) (29, 14) (29, 17) (29, 28) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 24) (28, 20) (28, 29) (3, 13) (3, 7) (11, 22) (11, 17) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 25) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 20) (23, 26) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 26) (12, 16) (12, 6) (9, 21) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 25) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 1) (24, 15) (24, 19) (24, 10) (10, 22) (10, 19) (10, 24) (4, 0) (4, 6) (25, 16) (25, 18) (6, 12) (6, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-2-14-8-27-15-12-26-1-17-29-28-20-23-7-3-13-18-21-9-0
- Cycle 2: 0-2-14-8-27-15-12-26-1-17-29-28-20-23-7-21-18-13-3-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-1-17-29-28-20-23-7-21-18-13-3-22-11-17-1-5-0
- Cycle 4: 0-5-22-13-18-21-9-0
- Cycle 5: 0-4-6-12-15-27-8-26-23-20-28-29-17-11-22-5-1-4
- Cycle 6: 0-4-6-12-15-24-19-10-22-13-18-25-16-12-2-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 2, 14, 8, 27, 15, 12, 26, 1, 17, (29, 28), 20, 23, 7, 3, 13, 18, 21, 9, 0>
- <0, 5, 1, 17, (29, 28), 20, 23, 7, 21, 18, 13, 3, 22, 11, 17, 1, 5, 0>
- <0, 4, 6, 12, 15, (27, 8), 26, 23, 20, 28, 29, 17, 11, 22, 5, 1, 4>
- <0, 5, 22, 13, 18, 21, 9, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordless cycles, so the answer is [4].
