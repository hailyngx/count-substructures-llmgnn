Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 26) (3, 12) (3, 18) (15, 0) (15, 9) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 23) (22, 27) (22, 6) (22, 12) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (23, 18) (23, 8) (23, 7) (23, 27) (1, 8) (26, 3) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 0) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 25) (17, 8) (17, 13) (4, 12) (4, 29) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 4) (12, 29) (5, 26) (5, 20) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 14) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 6) (14, 21) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 24) (14, 2) (29, 4) (29, 12) (29, 19) (7, 23) (7, 28) (7, 24) (20, 26) (20, 5) (20, 9) (20, 16) (0, 15) (0, 26) (0, 21) (27, 22) (27, 23) (25, 28) (25, 16) (24, 28) (24, 14) (24, 7) (6, 22) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 16) (9, 15) (9, 21) (9, 20) (9, 10) (2, 14) (16, 20) (16, 25) (16, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <3, 26, 5, 20, 26, 3>
- Cycle 2: <15, 0, 21, 28, 25, 16, 20, 5, 26, 0>
- Cycle 3: <18, 3, 12, 4, 29, 19, 14, 21, 0, 15, 9, 20, 5, 26, 20, 9, 21, 14, 29, 19>
- Cycle 4: <22, 27, 23, 28, 21, 0, 15, 9, 20, 26, 3, 12, 22>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (20, 5)
<3, (5, 20), 26>
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (21, 0)
<15, (0, 21), 28, 25, 16, 20, 5, 26, 0>
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (21, 14)
<18, 3, 12, 4, 29, 19, (14, 21), 0, 15, 9, 20, 5, 26, 20, 9, 21, 29, 19>
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (28, 23)
<22, 27, 23, (28, 21), 0, 15, 9, 20, 26, 3, 12, 22>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, there are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
