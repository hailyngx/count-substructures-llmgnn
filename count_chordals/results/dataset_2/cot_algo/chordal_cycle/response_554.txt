Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-2-0-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-3-4-5
- Cycle 3: 5-6-7-1-5

Step 2: Check for chordal 4-cycles:

- Checking Cycle 1: 5-9-2-0-5
  - Chord (2, 0) present
  - <5, (2, 0), 9>

- Checking Cycle 2: 5-9-3-4-5
  - Chord (3, 4) present
  - <5, (3, 4), 9>

- Checking Cycle 3: 5-6-7-1-5
  - No chords present

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, (2, 0), 9>
- <5, (3, 4), 9>
