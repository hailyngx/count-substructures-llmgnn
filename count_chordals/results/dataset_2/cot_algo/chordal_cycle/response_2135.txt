Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1 -> 7 -> 2 -> 1 (Chords: 1-2)
- Cycle 2: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 (Chords: 1-2)
- Cycle 3: 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 (Chords: 1-2)
- Cycle 4: 1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 1 (Chords: 1-5)
- Cycle 5: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 (Chords: 1-3)
- Cycle 6: 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 1 (Chords: 1-4)
- Cycle 7: 1 -> 7 -> 0 -> 1 (Chords: 1-0)
- Cycle 8: 1 -> 7 -> 4 -> 1 (Chords: 1-4)
- Cycle 9: 1 -> 7 -> 9 -> 1 (Chords: 1-9)
- Cycle 10: 1 -> 7 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 (Chords: 1-2, 1-5)
- Cycle 11: 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 7 -> 1 (Chords: 1-4, 1-7)
- Cycle 12: 1 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 (Chords: 1-2, 1-3)
- Cycle 13: 1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 6 -> 1 (Chords: 1-5, 1-6)
- Cycle 14: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 1 (Chords: 1-3, 1-8)

Step 2: 
Let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (1-2)
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (1-2)
- Cycle 3 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (1-2)
- Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (1-5)
- Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (1-3)
- Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (1-4)
- Cycle 7 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (1-0)
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (1-4)
- Cycle 9 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (1-9)
- Cycle 10 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 11 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 12 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 13 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 14 is not a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [9].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 7, 2, 1>
<1, 3, 2, 1>
<1, 5, 2, 1>
<1, 0, 5, 1>
<1, 2, 3, 1>
<1, 0, 4, 1>
<1, 7, 0, 1>
<1, 7, 4, 1>
<1, 7, 9, 1>
