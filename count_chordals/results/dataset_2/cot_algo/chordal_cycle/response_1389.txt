Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles in the graph, but we are interested in cycles of length 4 or more. 

Potential cycles of length 4:  
- Cycle 1: 6-9-1-6 
- Cycle 2: 6-4-7-0-6 
- Cycle 3: 9-8-7-0-9 
- Cycle 4: 1-3-5-7-1 
- Cycle 5: 3-0-7-8-3 
- Cycle 6: 4-7-8-9-4 
- Cycle 7: 7-5-0-3-7 
- Cycle 8: 0-2-9-8-0 

Step 2: 
Checking for each cycle if it has exactly one chord: 
- Cycle 1 (6-9-1-6) has no chords
- Cycle 2 (6-4-7-0-6) has no chords
- Cycle 3 (9-8-7-0-9) has no chords
- Cycle 4 (1-3-5-7-1) has no chords
- Cycle 5 (3-0-7-8-3) has no chords
- Cycle 6 (4-7-8-9-4) has no chords
- Cycle 7 (7-5-0-3-7) has no chords
- Cycle 8 (0-2-9-8-0) has no chords

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:  
There are 8 chordless cycles.
Thus, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<6, (1, 9), 6>
<6, (4, 7), 0>
<9, (7, 8), 0>
<1, (3, 5), 7>
<3, (0, 7), 8>
<4, (7, 8), 9>
<7, (0, 3), 5>
<0, (2, 9), 8>
