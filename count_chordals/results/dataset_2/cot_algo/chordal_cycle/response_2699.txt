Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Among the listed cycles, the following cycles have exactly one chord:

1. Cycle 4: <2, (6, 27), 7>
2. Cycle 10: <2, (12, 22), 26>
3. Cycle 14: <7, (3, 17), 12>
4. Cycle 37: <20, (9, 27), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 36 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [36].
