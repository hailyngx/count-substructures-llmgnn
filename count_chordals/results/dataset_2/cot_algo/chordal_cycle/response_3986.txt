Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 2) (6, 19) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 18) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 11) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 17) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 15) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 12) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (2, 6) (15, 7) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 9) (9, 15) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (4, 10, 1, 17, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 10, 1, 13, 3, 12, 11, 4)
        - Cycle 3: (4, 10, 1, 13, 17, 16, 4)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 11, 12, 3, 13, 1, 10, 4)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 11, 19, 6, 2, 14, 10, 4)
        - Cycle 6: (5, 7, 16, 4, 10, 1, 17, 5)
        - Cycle 7: (5, 15, 18, 14, 12, 3, 13, 1, 17, 5)
        - Cycle 8: (5, 15, 18, 8, 1, 13, 3, 14, 12, 11, 19, 6, 2, 7, 15)
        - Cycle 9: (6, 2, 14, 10, 1, 17, 16, 7, 5, 15, 18, 19, 11, 12, 3, 13, 6)
        - Cycle 10: (7, 16, 17, 13, 1, 10, 14, 18, 15, 5, 7)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - <1, (13, 17)>
        - <2, (3, 13)>
        - <3, (13, 17)>
        - <4, (1, 13)>
        - <5, (10, 14)>
        - <6, (4, 10)>
        - <7, (5, 18)>
        - <8, (12, 15)>
        - <9, (2, 16)>
        - <10, (1, 18)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        [10]
