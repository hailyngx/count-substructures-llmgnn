Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 2) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 6-7-3-1-6
- Cycle 2: 6-7-0-3-6
- Cycle 3: 6-4-2-9-6
- Cycle 4: 6-4-2-8-6

- Cycle 8: 9-2-8-10-9
- Cycle 9: 9-2-1-3-9

- Cycle 28: 11-5-0-7-11
- Cycle 29: 11-5-2-8-11
- Cycle 30: 11-8-2-5-11
- Cycle 31: 8-2-4-6-8
- Cycle 32: 8-12-10-11-8
- Cycle 33: 13-3-0-14-13
- Cycle 34: 13-9-6-4-13
- Cycle 35: 13-9-2-1-13
- Cycle 36: 7-0-14-9-7
- Cycle 37: 7-12-10-11-7
- Cycle 38: 7-3-1-6-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <1, (3, 7), 6> with chord (3, 7)
- <1, (3, 0), 10> with chord (3, 0)
- <1, (2, 9), 6> with chord (2, 9)
- <10, (12, 8), 11> with chord (12, 8)
- <10, (12, 5), 11> with chord (12, 5)
- <10, (5, 0), 6> with chord (5, 0)
- <11, (5, 2), 8> with chord (5, 2)
- <13, (9, 2), 6> with chord (9, 2)
- <13, (14, 0), 9> with chord (14, 0)
- <7, (0, 14), 9> with chord (0, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [10].
