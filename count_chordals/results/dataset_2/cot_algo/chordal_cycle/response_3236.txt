- Cycle 16: (11, 14, 17, 22, 4)
- Cycle 17: (11, 27, 26, 28, 6)
- Cycle 18: (11, 20, 10, 12, 4)
- Cycle 19: (11, 29, 0, 20, 10)
- Cycle 20: (12, 4, 22, 17, 14)

- Cycle 23: (14, 17, 22, 4, 6)
- Cycle 24: (14, 29, 0, 16, 5)
- Cycle 25: (16, 0, 20, 11, 29)
- Cycle 26: (16, 5, 25, 1, 28)
- Cycle 27: (16, 9, 2, 25, 26)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <3, (15, 23), 28, 1>
- <3, 15, (14, 17), 22>
- <14, (17, 22), 4, 12>
- <14, 11, (27, 26), 28>
- <14, (29, 0), 20, 11>
- <15, (23, 24), 28, 6>
- <4, 22, (17, 14), 29>
- <4, (12, 21), 19, 27>
- <4, 6, (28, 26), 25>
- <4, (29, 0), 10, 12>
- <5, 13, (25, 2), 18>
- <5, (16, 0), 20, 11>
- <5, 4, 22, (17, 14)>
- <5, 9, (8, 20), 11>
- <11, 14, (17, 22), 4>
- <11, (27, 26), 28, 6>
- <11, 20, (10, 12), 4>
- <11, (29, 0), 20, 10>
- <12, 4, 22, (17, 14)>
- <12, (21, 19), 27, 11>
- <12, 10, 7, (19, 21)>
- <14, 17, 22, (4, 6)>
- <14, 29, 0, (16, 5)>
- <16, 0, 20, (11, 29)>
- <16, 5, (25, 1), 28>
- <16, 9, (2, 25), 26>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we get [27].
