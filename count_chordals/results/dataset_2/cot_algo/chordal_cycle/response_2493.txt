- Cycle 3: (3, 1, 11, 4)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 11, 7)
- Cycle 5: (3, 1, 11, 2)
- Cycle 6: (3, 26, 14, 6)
- Cycle 7: (20, 25, 7, 5)
- Cycle 8: (0, 29, 24, 27)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 12, 21)
- Cycle 10: (6, 14, 26, 3)
- Cycle 11: (6, 15, 26, 14)
- Cycle 12: (6, 15, 17, 24)
- Cycle 13: (6, 22, 27, 24)
- Cycle 14: (11, 3, 26, 14)
- Cycle 15: (11, 4, 8, 12)
- Cycle 16: (11, 7, 25, 20)
- Cycle 17: (11, 2, 19, 4)
- Cycle 18: (11, 29, 24, 17)
- Cycle 19: (7, 5, 15, 28)
- Cycle 20: (7, 11, 3, 26)
- Cycle 21: (7, 25, 20, 13)
- Cycle 22: (16, 28, 15, 6)
- Cycle 23: (16, 26, 14, 6)
- Cycle 24: (16, 18, 21, 12)
- Cycle 25: (24, 17, 15, 5)
- Cycle 26: (24, 27, 22, 6)
- Cycle 27: (24, 29, 0, 23)
- Cycle 28: (18, 20, 14, 6)
- Cycle 29: (18, 21, 12, 5)
- Cycle 30: (18, 16, 26, 14)
- Cycle 31: (18, 23, 13, 20)
- Cycle 32: (23, 0, 29, 24)
- Cycle 33: (23, 19, 2, 11)
- Cycle 34: (19, 4, 11, 3)
- Cycle 35: (19, 27, 22, 6)
- Cycle 36: (29, 0, 23, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (15, 14), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (19, 4), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (1, 11), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (8, 12), 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (7, 25), 20>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (15, 26), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (25, 20), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (12, 21), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (29, 0), 23>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The final count is [27].
