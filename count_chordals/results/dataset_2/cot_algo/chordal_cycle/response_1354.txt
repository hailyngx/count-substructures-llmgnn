5. Cycle <1, 3, 11, 2, 1> has one chord (3, 11) 
6. Cycle <1, 6, 12, 0, 2, 1> has one chord (6, 12) 
7. Cycle <2, 0, 12, 6, 1, 2> has one chord (0, 12) 
8. Cycle <2, 0, 12, 10, 2> has one chord (0, 12) 
9. Cycle <3, 1, 6, 12, 0, 3> has one chord (1, 6) 
10. Cycle <3, 5, 11, 2, 3> has one chord (5, 11)
