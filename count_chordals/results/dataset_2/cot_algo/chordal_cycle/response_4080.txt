Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 4) (13, 1) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 5, 7, 11, 0>
2. Cycle <1, 2, 10, 7, 1>
3. Cycle <1, 4, 6, 13, 1>
4. Cycle <4, 5, 12, 6, 4>
5. Cycle <7, 6, 12, 5, 7>
6. Cycle <9, 14, 10, 7, 9>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle, we find that the following cycles have exactly one chord:
1. <0, 5, 7, 11, 0> has one chord (5, 11)
2. <1, 2, 10, 7, 1> has one chord (2, 7)
3. <1, 4, 6, 13, 1> has one chord (4, 13)
4. <7, 6, 12, 5, 7> has one chord (6, 5)
5. <9, 14, 10, 7, 9> has one chord (10, 14)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 5, 7, 11, 0> with chord (5, 11)
<1, 2, 10, 7, 1> with chord (2, 7)
<1, 4, 6, 13, 1> with chord (4, 13)
<7, 6, 12, 5, 7> with chord (6, 5)
<9, 14, 10, 7, 9> with chord (10, 14)
