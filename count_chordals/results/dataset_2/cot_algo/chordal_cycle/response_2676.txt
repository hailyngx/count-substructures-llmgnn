Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 7) (16, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 16) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 14) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) (18, 10) (18, 17) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 17) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 19) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:

1. Cycle 1-6-8-16-7-2-11-13-9-4-1
2. Cycle 1-6-8-14-10-15-13-11-12-17-2-7-16
3. Cycle 1-3-14-10-15-13-11-12-17-2-7-16
4. Cycle 1-3-14-8-6-1
5. Cycle 0-5-4-9-13-11-12-17-2
6. Cycle 0-5-4-1-6-8-14-10-15
7. Cycle 15-14-8-6-1-3-14
8. Cycle 13-10-14-8-6-1-3

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles satisfying the condition of exactly one chord are:
1. <1, 3, 14, 10>
2. <1, 6, 8, (16, 7)>
3. <1, 6, 8, (14, 10)>
4. <1, 6, 8, (14, 3)>
5. <0, 5, 4, (9, 13)>
6. <0, 5, 4, (1, 6)>
7. <15, 14, 8, (6, 1)>
8. <13, 10, 14, (1, 6)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
