The edges are as follows: (6, 21) (6, 20) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 20) (14, 15) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 4) (0, 6) (0, 27) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 26) (27, 5) (20, 6) (20, 14) (20, 25) (20, 13) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 12) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 29) (28, 17) (28, 29) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 13) (29, 5) (21, 6) (21, 24) (13, 20) (13, 29) (13, 12) (13, 16) (26, 27) (26, 15) (7, 25) (7, 2) (7, 22) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 26) (11, 8) (11, 12) (23, 24) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 3) (5, 27) (5, 29) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 4) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 19) (12, 25) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 24) (24, 21) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 1) (1, 9) (1, 24) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 16) (22, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

1. (6, 20, 14, 17, 6)
2. (6, 20, 14, 10, 3, 9, 1, 24, 21, 6)
3. (6, 20, 14, 10, 17, 28, 29, 13, 20)
4. (6, 20, 25, 7, 22, 7, 2, 10, 14, 20)
5. (6, 0, 27, 26, 15, 14, 20, 6)
6. (6, 0, 27, 5, 29, 18, 15, 26, 15, 14, 20, 6)
7. (6, 0, 27, 5, 29, 13, 16, 4, 17, 14, 20, 6)
8. (9, 3, 10, 14, 20, 6, 21, 24, 1, 9)
9. (9, 3, 10, 14, 20, 25, 12, 24, 1, 9)
10. (9, 3, 10, 2, 7, 25, 12, 24, 1, 9)
11. (14, 17, 28, 29, 13, 20, 6, 21, 24, 1, 14)
... and more

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <6, (14, 17), 20>
2. <6, (10, 3), 14>
3. <6, (14, 20), 25>
4. <25, (7, 22), 14>
5. <6, (0, 27), 26>
6. <6, (27, 5), 29>
7. <6, (13, 16), 20>
8. <9, (10, 14), 3>
9. <9, (14, 20), 25>
10. <9, (7, 2), 10>
11. <14, (28, 29), 17>
... and more

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [12] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.
