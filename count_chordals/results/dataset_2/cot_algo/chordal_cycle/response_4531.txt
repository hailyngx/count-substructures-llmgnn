Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph (ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists).

Cycles of length 4: 
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 4, 1, 6)
- Cycle 2: (10, 11, 12, 1, 10)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 13, 12, 0)
- Cycle 4: (3, 11, 8, 5, 3)
- Cycle 5: (8, 10, 1, 4, 8)
- Cycle 6: (14, 8, 5, 1, 14)
- Cycle 7: (13, 12, 1, 9, 13)
- Cycle 8: (7, 9, 4, 5, 7)
- Cycle 9: (2, 6, 0, 1, 2)
- Cycle 10: (5, 7, 13, 14, 5)

Now, we will identify the cycles with exactly one chord. 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (6, 9), 4, 1> with chord (6, 9)
- <10, (11, 12), 1, 10> with chord (11, 12)
- <0, (6, 13), 12, 0> with chord (6, 13)
- <3, (11, 8), 5, 3> with chord (11, 8)
- <8, (10, 1), 4, 8> with chord (10, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [5].
