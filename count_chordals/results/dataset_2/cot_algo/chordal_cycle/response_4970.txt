Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 17) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 8) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 17) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 16) (19, 4) (19, 14) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 16) (14, 19) (14, 12) (18, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 17) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 11) (17, 12) (16, 4) (16, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 17, 7, 13, 5, 3)
- Cycle 2: (6, 1, 13, 11, 9, 2, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 1, 13, 7, 0, 12, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 8, 10, 2, 9, 11, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 4, 19, 14, 12, 0, 6)
- Cycle 6: (7, 0, 12, 14, 19, 4, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 11, 13, 1, 8, 10, 7)
- Cycle 8: (7, 17, 15, 3, 2, 10, 7)
- Cycle 9: (11, 9, 2, 10, 8, 1, 11)
- Cycle 10: (11, 13, 7, 0, 12, 17, 11)
- Cycle 11: (14, 19, 4, 6, 10, 2, 14)
- Cycle 12: (16, 2, 10, 8, 1, 13, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 13, (11), 9> (Cycle 2)
- <6, 1, (13), 11> (Cycle 7)
- <6, 8, (10), 2> (Cycle 4)
- <7, 0, (12), 14> (Cycle 6)
- <8, 1, (13), 11> (Cycle 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- There are 8 chordless cycles found in the graph.
- Therefore, the final answer is [8].
