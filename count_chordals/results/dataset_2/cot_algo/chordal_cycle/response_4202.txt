Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 7) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1 - 3 - 14 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 8 - 2 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 5 - 6 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 5 - 10 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 8 - 11 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 8 - 13 - 4 - 12 - 9 - 2 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 8 - 13 - 6 - 5 - 10 - 3 - 14 - 1
- Cycle 8: 1 - 14 - 7 - 11 - 3 - 10 - 0 - 2 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 9: 3 - 14 - 7 - 9 - 12 - 4 - 13 - 8 - 11 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (2, 9).
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has no chords.
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (6, 13).
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (6, 13).
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (2, 9).
- Cycle 9 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, 8, (2, 9), 9, 1>
<1, 5, 6, 8, 1>
<1, 5, 10, 3, 14, 7, 11, 3, 1>
<1, 8, (6, 13), 4, 12, 9, 2, 6, 1>
