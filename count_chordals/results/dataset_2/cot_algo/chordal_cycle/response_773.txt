Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 1) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 24) (17, 14) (17, 10) (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 19) (27, 8) (20, 9) (20, 21) (20, 6) (25, 26) (25, 2) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (6, 20) (6, 1) (6, 3) (21, 9) (21, 20) (21, 28) (21, 29) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 2) (28, 23) (22, 26) (22, 0) (26, 25) (26, 22) (3, 6) (3, 13) (18, 14) (18, 24) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 12) (19, 27) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 16) (2, 15) (2, 25) (2, 28) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 13) (16, 19) (16, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 8) (0, 11) (0, 28) (0, 22) (8, 15) (8, 27) (8, 7) (8, 24) (24, 14) (24, 18) (24, 7) (24, 8) (4, 19) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 23) (29, 21) (29, 23) (23, 14) (23, 28) (23, 13) (23, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (9, 20, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 20, 21, 9)
- Cycle 3: (14, 17, 10, 7, 24, 14)
- Cycle 4: (14, 17, 10, 7, 11, 5, 11, 0, 28, 21, 14)
- Cycle 5: (14, 18, 24, 7, 10, 17, 14)
- Cycle 6: (14, 23, 28, 21, 29, 23)
- Cycle 7: (14, 24, 18, 14)
- Cycle 8: (17, 14, 18, 24, 7, 8, 15, 27, 19, 16, 12, 2, 25, 26, 22, 0, 28, 23, 13, 3, 6, 20, 21, 29, 23)
- Cycle 9: (10, 17, 14, 23, 28, 0, 11, 7, 24, 18, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <9, 20, 6, 1, 9> has 1 chord: (6, 1)
- <9, 20, 21, 9> has 1 chord: (20, 21)
- <14, 17, 10, 7, 24, 14> has 1 chord: (10, 24)
- <14, 17, 10, 7, 11, 5, 11, 0, 28, 21, 14> has 1 chord: (10, 28)
- <14, 18, 24, 7, 10, 17, 14> has 1 chord: (10, 24)
- <14, 23, 28, 21, 29, 23> has 1 chord: (21, 23)
- <14, 24, 18, 14> has 1 chord: (18, 24)
- <17, 14, 18, 24, 7, 8, 15, 27, 19, 16, 12, 2, 25, 26, 22, 0, 28, 23, 13, 3, 6, 20, 21, 29, 23> has 1 chord: (7, 19)
- <10, 17, 14, 23, 28, 0, 11, 7, 24, 18, 14> has 1 chord: (7, 28)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [9].
