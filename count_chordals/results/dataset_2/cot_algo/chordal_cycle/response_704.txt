Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 16) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 17) (0, 5) (0, 16) (14, 4) (14, 16) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 11) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 15) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 10) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 1) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 19) (19, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (5, 9, 3, 8, 13, 2, 11, 5)
- (5, 9, 3, 10, 1, 6, 16, 0, 5)
- (5, 11, 2, 13, 18, 15, 1, 6, 5)
- (5, 6, 1, 10, 3, 8, 13, 18, 6)
- (8, 13, 18, 15, 1, 10, 3, 9, 8)
- (13, 2, 11, 5, 6, 16, 14, 4, 17, 1, 15, 18, 13)
- (6, 1, 10, 7, 12, 17, 4, 14, 16, 6)

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- (5, 9, 3, 10, 1, 6, 16, 0, 5) has one chord <(6, 16)>
- (5, 6, 1, 10, 3, 8, 13, 18, 6) has one chord <(1, 18)>
- (13, 2, 11, 5, 6, 16, 14, 4, 17, 1, 15, 18, 13) has one chord <(6, 14)>
- (6, 1, 10, 7, 12, 17, 4, 14, 16, 6) has one chord <(7, 14)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles = [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, 9, 3, 10, (6, 16), 1, 5>
<5, 6, 1, 10, 3, 8, 13, 18, (6, 1)>
<13, 2, 11, 5, 6, (14, 6), 16, 4, 17, 1, 15, 18, 13>
<6, 1, 10, 7, 12, 17, 4, (14, 7), 16, 6>
