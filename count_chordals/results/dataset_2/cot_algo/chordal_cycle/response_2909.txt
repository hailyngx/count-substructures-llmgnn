Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (26, 24) (1, 24) (1, 13) (21, 8) (21, 11) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (27, 11) (27, 8) (27, 16) (8, 21) (8, 27) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 19) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 17) (5, 18) (5, 25) (5, 15) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 4) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 23) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 4) (20, 16) (28, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 29) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 21) (11, 27) (11, 3) (11, 7) (17, 18) (17, 20) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 10) (10, 0) (10, 24) (10, 16) (4, 6) (4, 20) (4, 22) (4, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 14) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 29) (29, 22) (29, 7) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 4) (23, 15) (23, 25) (23, 16) (25, 13) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 23) (16, 27) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 23) 

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in this graph can be listed as follows:

Step 1: Identify all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 7, 11, 0>
2. <0, 3, 7, 29, 22, 9, 15, 5, 18, 12, 14, 0>
3. <0, 3, 7, 29, 22, 9, 15, 5, 18, 17, 20, 16, 27, 11, 21, 8, 13, 1, 24, 10, 0>
4. <0, 3, 7, 29, 22, 4, 6, 28, 6, 25, 13, 1, 24, 10, 16, 23, 25, 15, 9, 22, 4, 19, 0>
5. <8, 13, 25, 23, 16, 27, 11, 7, 3, 0, 19, 4, 6, 28, 6, 25, 5, 15, 9, 22, 4, 20, 17, 18, 12, 2, 13>
6. <25, 23, 15, 9, 22, 29, 7, 3, 0, 10, 24, 1, 13, 8, 21, 11, 27, 16>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <0, 3, 7, 29, 22, 9, 15, 5, 18, 12, 14, 0> has only one chord: (7, 29)
2. <8, 13, 25, 23, 16, 27, 11, 7, 3, 0, 19, 4, 6, 28, 6, 25, 5, 15, 9, 22, 4, 20, 17, 18, 12, 2, 13> has only one chord: (7, 29)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are <0, 3, 7, 29, 22, 9, 15, 5, 18, 12, 14, 0> and <8, 13, 25, 23, 16, 27, 11, 7, 3, 0, 19, 4, 6, 28, 6, 25, 5, 15, 9, 22, 4, 20, 17, 18, 12, 2, 13>.
