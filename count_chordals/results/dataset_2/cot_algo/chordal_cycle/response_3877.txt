Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 3) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 13) (8, 18) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 13) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 18) (9, 2) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 18) (6, 2) (6, 13) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 13) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 15, 14)
- Cycle 2: (17, 14, 7, 15)
- Cycle 3: (4, 3, 17, 14)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 3, 17)
- Cycle 5: (5, 4, 3, 10)
- Cycle 6: (5, 1, 16, 15)
- Cycle 7: (5, 12, 11, 16)
- Cycle 8: (5, 12, 11, 17)
- Cycle 9: (5, 12, 13, 7)
- Cycle 10: (5, 19, 18, 15)
- Cycle 11: (5, 19, 18, 1)
- Cycle 12: (5, 19, 13, 7)
- Cycle 13: (14, 17, 11, 16)
- Cycle 14: (14, 17, 11, 12)
- Cycle 15: (17, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 16: (17, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 17: (15, 16, 1, 5)
- Cycle 18: (15, 7, 13, 19)
- Cycle 19: (15, 18, 19, 13)
- Cycle 20: (15, 18, 19, 5)
- Cycle 21: (15, 18, 1, 5)
- Cycle 22: (3, 17, 14, 15)
- Cycle 23: (3, 17, 11, 16)
- Cycle 24: (3, 17, 11, 12)
- Cycle 25: (3, 5, 12, 13)
- Cycle 26: (3, 5, 19, 18)
- Cycle 27: (3, 5, 1, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <11, (16, 15), 14>
- <17, (14, 7), 15>
- <5, (4, 3), 17>
- <5, (12, 11), 16>
- <5, (12, 13), 7>
- <5, (19, 18), 15>
- <15, (7, 13), 19>
- <15, (18, 19), 13>
- <15, (18, 1), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 20 chordal 4-cycles in the graph. Hence, the final count is [20].
