Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-10-2-0-1
- Cycle 2: 1-10-2-4-5-1
- Cycle 3: 1-10-2-8-4-1
- Cycle 4: 1-10-2-8-3-5-1
- Cycle 5: 1-10-2-0-12-14-1
- Cycle 6: 2-0-12-14-6-9-10-2
- Cycle 7: 3-4-2-8-3
- Cycle 8: 3-4-2-10-1-7-3
- Cycle 9: 3-4-5-12-0-13-3
- Cycle 10: 3-5-4-8-3
- Cycle 11: 3-5-4-2-10-1-7-3
- Cycle 12: 3-5-12-0-13-3
- Cycle 13: 3-8-2-10-1-7-3
- Cycle 14: 3-8-2-0-12-14-3
- Cycle 15: 5-4-2-0-12-5
- Cycle 16: 5-4-2-10-1-7-5
- Cycle 17: 5-4-8-3-5
- Cycle 18: 5-7-1-10-2-4-5
- Cycle 19: 5-7-1-14-12-5
- Cycle 20: 5-7-3-4-2-10-1-5

Step 2:
From the above cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- Chordal 4-Cycle 1: <1, 10, 2, 0, 1>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 2: <1, 10, 2, 8, 4, 1>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 3: <3, 4, 2, 10, 1, 7, 3>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 4: <3, 4, 5, 12, 0, 13, 3>
- Chordal 4-Cycle 5: <5, 4, 2, 10, 1, 7, 5>

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [5].
