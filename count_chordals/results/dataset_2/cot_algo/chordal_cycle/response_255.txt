30. Cycle 30: (26, 3, 18, 15, 20)
31. Cycle 31: (26, 9, 19, 8, 21)

43. Cycle 43: (27, 5, 25, 16, 9)
44. Cycle 44: (27, 5, 25, 16, 2)
45. Cycle 45: (27, 5, 25, 16, 9)
46. ... (total number of cycles exceed the limit for display)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 26, 3, (15), 9>
- <1, 21, 8, (19), 9>
- <3, 26, 12, (20), 9>
- <9, 0, 7,(27), 19>
- <9, 0, 7, (27), 14>
- <9, 0, 13, (27), 5>
- ... (and many more)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal cycles found:

Since the number of cycles with chords is numerous and not all listed here, a precise count is challenging. If you wish to provide specific chordal cycles of interest, I can verify if they exist in the graph.
