Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 5) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 10) (17, 0) (17, 3) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 10) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 18) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 10) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 3) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 11) (15, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-6-9-2-5
- Cycle 2: 5-7-9-1-5
- Cycle 3: 0-5-7-9-0
- Cycle 4: 0-5-13-10-3-0
- Cycle 5: 0-5-2-9-1-0
- Cycle 6: 0-5-6-9-1-0
- Cycle 7: 0-5-13-10-1-0
- Cycle 8: 0-5-2-8-11-18-0
- Cycle 9: 0-5-2-8-11-4-9-0
- Cycle 10: 0-5-2-8-19-16-7-0
- Cycle 11: 0-5-2-9-16-7-0
- Cycle 12: 0-14-3-10-13-5-0
- Cycle 13: 0-17-3-10-13-5-0
- Cycle 14: 0-17-3-10-1-9-0
- Cycle 15: 6-9-2-8-19-16-7-5
- Cycle 16: 6-9-2-8-11-18-0-5
- Cycle 17: 6-5-0-17-3-10-13-6
- Cycle 18: 6-5-0-17-3-10-1-9-6
- Cycle 19: 6-5-0-14-3-10-13-6
- Cycle 20: 6-5-0-14-3-10-1-9-6

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge):
- Cycle 2 (5-7-9-1-5) has one chord (7-1)
- Cycle 3 (0-5-7-9-0) has one chord (5-9)
- Cycle 9 (0-5-2-8-11-4-9-0) has one chord (5-8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 7, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 7, 9>
<0, 5, 2, 8, 11, 4, 9>
