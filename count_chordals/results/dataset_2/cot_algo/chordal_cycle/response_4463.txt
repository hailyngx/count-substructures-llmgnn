Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 4, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 4, 6, 7, 9)
- Cycle 5: (6, 1, 0, 2, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 4, 7, 2, 6)
- Cycle 7: (4, 7, 8, 5, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 8, 3, 6, 7)
- Cycle 9: (8, 3, 0, 5, 8)
- Cycle 10: (3, 8, 7, 4, 3)
- Cycle 11: (2, 0, 1, 6, 2)
- Cycle 12: (1, 0, 9, 4, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <2, (5, 7), 6>
- Cycle 3 is a chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <3, (1, 9), 4>
- Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <4, (1, 7), 9>
- Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <6, (1, 7), 4>
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <8, (6, 3), 7>
- Cycle 10 is a chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <10, (4, 7), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The final number is [0].
