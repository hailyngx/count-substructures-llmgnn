Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (4, 15) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 18) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 18) (19, 9) (19, 18) (0, 6) (0, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 5) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 14) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 12) (12, 15) (12, 11) (12, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 15-1-11-12-15
- Cycle 2: 6-9-2-15-6
- Cycle 3: 6-8-18-19-9-6
- Cycle 4: 4-15-1-11-4
- Cycle 5: 7-10-5-16-13-14-7
- Cycle 6: 7-4-15-2-9-19-18-8-6-11-7
- Cycle 7: 0-6-9-19-18-8-0
- Cycle 8: 16-5-14-18-19-9-2-12-11-1-16

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <Cycle 1, (1, 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <Cycle 2, (9, 15)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <Cycle 3, (9, 18)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <Cycle 4, (1, 11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <Cycle 5, (14, 16)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <Cycle 6, (9, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <Cycle 8, (5, 18)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
