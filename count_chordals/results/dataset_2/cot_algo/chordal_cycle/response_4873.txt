Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 18) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 18) (7, 6) (7, 19) (12, 16) (12, 17) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 8) (18, 13) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 19) (17, 12) (17, 15) (13, 3) (13, 18) (0, 10) (0, 8) (15, 16) (15, 17) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 15, 17, 12) with 5 edges
- Cycle 2: (11, 16, 9, 8, 19) with 5 edges
- Cycle 3: (11, 10, 14, 2, 1) with 5 edges
- Cycle 4: (11, 10, 9, 4, 18) with 5 edges
- Cycle 5: (16, 15, 17, 12, 16) with 4 edges
- Cycle 6: (16, 9, 8, 19, 16) with 4 edges
- Cycle 7: (16, 12, 17, 15, 16) with 4 edges
- Cycle 8: (16, 15, 17, 12, 16) with 4 edges
... (additional cycles may also be obtained)

Step 2:
Checking the cycles for exactly one chord:
- <1, (2, 14), 10, (11, 19)>
- <1, (2, 6), 3, (13, 18)>
- <1, (2, 14), 10, (9, 4)>
- <1, (2, 14), 10, (0, 8)>
- <1, (2, 14), 10, (9, 4)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (2, 6), 3, (13, 18)>
- <1, (2, 14), 10, (11, 19)>
