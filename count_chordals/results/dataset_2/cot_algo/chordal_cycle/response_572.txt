Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (6, 9, 0, 8, 6)
        - Cycle 2: (6, 5, 1, 8, 6)
        - Cycle 3: (6, 1, 2, 7, 6)
        - Cycle 4: (6, 4, 7, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 5: (6, 8, 0, 3, 6)
        - Cycle 6: (9, 8, 1, 5, 9)
        - Cycle 7: (9, 0, 3, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 8: (1, 5, 7, 4, 1)
        - Cycle 9: (3, 0, 8, 4, 3)
        - Cycle 10: (7, 2, 1, 5, 7)
        - Cycle 11: (5, 7, 4, 8, 5)
        - Cycle 12: (0, 3, 7, 2, 0)
        - Cycle 13: (2, 1, 6, 9, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1 and Cycle 8 have exactly one chord.
        - Therefore, we have found two chordal 4-cycles.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - The number of chordless cycles is [11].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 7), 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, (9, 0), 8>
