Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 15) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 6) (10, 13) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 11) (3, 19) (3, 17) (3, 16) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 11) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 17) (7, 18) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 13) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 7) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 12) (1, 19) (1, 4) (16, 2) (16, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (2, 5, 8, 19, 3, 17, 0, 11)
- Cycle 2: (2, 5, 8, 19, 1, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 8, 17, 0, 11, 19, 3)
- Cycle 4: (2, 5, 8, 17, 3, 16, 2, 15)
- Cycle 5: (2, 5, 6, 10, 13, 7, 15, 18)
- Cycle 6: (2, 5, 6, 15, 18, 7, 14, 4)
- Cycle 7: (8, 5, 6, 10, 13, 7, 15, 18)
- Cycle 8: (8, 5, 6, 15, 7, 14, 4, 1)
- Cycle 9: (8, 5, 2, 15, 18, 7, 14, 4)
- Cycle 10: (19, 8, 5, 6, 10, 13, 7, 15)
- Cycle 11: (19, 8, 5, 2, 15, 7, 14, 4)
- Cycle 12: (19, 8, 5, 2, 16, 3, 17, 0)
- Cycle 13: (3, 19, 8, 5, 2, 16, 2, 15)
- Cycle 14: (3, 19, 8, 5, 6, 10, 13, 7)
- Cycle 15: (11, 0, 9, 4, 1, 19, 8, 5)
- Cycle 16: (11, 0, 9, 18, 15, 7, 13, 10)
- Cycle 17: (11, 0, 9, 18, 15, 7, 13, 12)
- Cycle 18: (11, 0, 9, 18, 7, 13, 10, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (2, 19), 4, 9)> has a chord (2, 19)
- <2, (5, 8), 17, 0)> has a chord (5, 8)
- <2, (5, 6), 15, 18)> has a chord (5, 6)
- <2, (5, 8), 17, 0)> has a chord (5, 8)
- <8, (5, 6), 15, 18)> has a chord (5, 6)
- <8, (2, 15), 7, 14)> has a chord (2, 15)
- <19, (8, 5), 6, 10)> has a chord (8, 5)
- <19, (3, 16), 17, 0)> has a chord (3, 16)
- <9, (0, 4), 1, 19)> has a chord (0, 4)
- <18, (9, 15), 7, 14)> has a chord (9, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [9]
