Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 29) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (4, 23) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 22) (12, 27) (12, 0) (27, 12) (27, 22) (27, 10) (27, 11) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 3) (2, 25) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 13) (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 11) (20, 15) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 22) (28, 0) (28, 14) (17, 9) (17, 8) (29, 5) (29, 19) (29, 21) (3, 2) (3, 20) (3, 21) (3, 26) (21, 29) (21, 3) (21, 24) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 25) (11, 27) (11, 18) (11, 15) (23, 4) (22, 7) (22, 27) (22, 2) (22, 20) (22, 16) (26, 3) (26, 16) (26, 8) (8, 20) (8, 17) (8, 26) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 14) (16, 10) (24, 21) (24, 16) (24, 10) (0, 12) (0, 15) (0, 28) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 28) (14, 16) (25, 2) (25, 1) (19, 7) (19, 29) (13, 18) (10, 27) (10, 16) (10, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 9-6-7-14-9
- Cycle 2: 27-22-20-3-27
- Cycle 3: 20-3-21-29-20
- Cycle 4: 1-15-11-27-1

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (6, 14) 
- Cycle 2 does not have a chord
- Cycle 3 has a chord (3, 21) 
- Cycle 4 has a chord (15, 27)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <9, 6, 7, 14, (6, 14)>
- <1, 15, 11, 27, (15, 27)>
