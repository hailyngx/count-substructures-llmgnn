Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (21, 10) (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 17) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 11) (18, 22) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 8) (22, 2) (22, 18) (26, 1) (26, 16) (15, 20) (15, 24) (15, 28) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 5) (28, 15) (28, 14) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (9, 7) (9, 4) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 3) (24, 15) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 23) (25, 11) (13, 17) (13, 25) (13, 0) (10, 21) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 16) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (3, 12) (3, 17) (3, 23) (16, 26) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 8) (5, 20) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 28) (14, 5) (19, 10) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 23) (11, 29) (11, 25) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 8) (23, 25) (23, 3) (23, 0) (8, 18) (8, 7) (8, 27) (8, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (2, 29, 11, 25, 13, 17, 2)
- Cycle 2: (18, 27, 20, 15, 24, 25, 13, 0, 18)
- Cycle 3: (7, 12, 3, 17, 13, 25, 7)
- Cycle 4: (10, 21, 10)
- Cycle 5: (4, 12, 3, 23, 0, 13, 17, 4)
- Cycle 6: (16, 26, 1, 26, 16)
- Cycle 7: (6, 7, 25, 11, 0, 23, 3, 12, 6)
- Cycle 8: (18, 0, 2, 29, 11, 25, 7, 8, 18)
- Cycle 9: (20, 27, 18, 0, 13, 17, 3, 12, 7, 6, 10, 16, 5, 20)
- Cycle 10: (14, 28, 15, 20, 5, 14)
- Cycle 11: (10, 6, 7, 25, 11, 4, 10)
- Cycle 12: (4, 10, 19, 10)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord <29, 11>
- Cycle 2 has chord <27, 18>
- Cycle 3 has chord <12, 7>
- Cycle 5 has chord <13, 17>
- Cycle 9 has chord <27, 18>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found = [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<2, (29, 11)>
<18, (27, 18)>
<7, (12, 7)>
<4, (13, 17)>
<6, (10, 7)>
<10, (25, 11)>
<16, (6, 10)>
