Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 14) (16, 10) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (1, 6) (1, 18) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 12) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 19) (2, 3) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 10) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 18) (18, 1) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 12, 7, 9, 3, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 12, 18, 1, 6, 0)
- Cycle 3: (3, 9, 7, 12, 0, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 9, 12, 18, 17, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <Cycle 1, (0, 7)>
- <Cycle 2, (12, 1)>
- <Cycle 3, (9, 12)>
- <Cycle 4, (18, 9)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found, so the final number is [0].
