Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 6) (1, 27) (1, 18) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 6) (3, 27) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 23) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 7) (17, 2) (17, 25) (20, 29) (20, 10) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 19) (29, 20) (29, 26) (29, 21) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 25) (8, 18) (9, 8) (9, 15) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 26) (7, 2) (7, 6) (25, 17) (25, 8) (25, 19) (25, 14) (25, 10) (23, 0) (23, 15) (23, 13) (26, 29) (26, 12) (26, 15) (10, 20) (10, 4) (10, 25) (24, 3) (22, 5) (18, 1) (18, 0) (18, 8) (18, 19) (19, 11) (19, 28) (19, 25) (19, 18) (15, 9) (15, 23) (15, 26) (15, 21) (6, 16) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 13) (14, 28) (14, 25) (14, 5) (27, 1) (27, 3) (27, 5) (21, 29) (21, 15) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 23) (13, 6) (5, 22) (5, 14) (5, 27) 

Response:
The graph described has the following unique chordal 4-cycle:

<1, (11, 19), 5, 27>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
