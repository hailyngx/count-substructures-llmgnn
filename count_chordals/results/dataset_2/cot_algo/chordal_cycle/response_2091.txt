Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 19) (14, 0) (14, 19) (17, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 12) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (3, 6) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 2) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 15) (7, 8) (7, 11) (16, 1) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 2) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 2) (1, 9) (1, 16) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (18, 0) (18, 3) (18, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
    - Cycle 1: (4, 5, 10, 8, 4)
    - Cycle 2: (4, 13, 6, 3, 18, 0, 12, 4)
    - Cycle 3: (4, 13, 10, 8, 4)
    - Cycle 4: (11, 9, 19, 14, 0, 12, 11)
    - Cycle 5: (11, 9, 19, 14, 0, 18, 15, 11)
    - Cycle 6: (11, 9, 19, 12, 15, 2, 11)
    - Cycle 7: (11, 9, 19, 12, 0, 18, 3, 6, 13, 10, 11)
    - Cycle 8: (11, 9, 1, 16, 1, 11)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - Cycle 1 has one chord: (8, 10)
    - Cycle 2 has one chord: (4, 12)
    - Cycle 3 has one chord: (4, 10)
    - Cycle 4 has one chord: (9, 14)
    - Cycle 5 has one chord: (9, 14)
    - Cycle 6 has one chord: (9, 2)
    - Cycle 7 has one chord: (19, 6)
    - Cycle 8 has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
    There is 1 chordless cycle found in the graph: <11, (9, 1), 16>

Final count: [1]
