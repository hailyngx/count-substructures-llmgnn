This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (16, 22) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (15, 22) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 25) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 28) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 29) (13, 9) (13, 27) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 20) (0, 12) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 2) (20, 28) (28, 7) (28, 20) (28, 18) (29, 13) (29, 1) (29, 21) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 22) (24, 22) (26, 2) (27, 4) (27, 13) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 25) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 26) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 17) (22, 24) (21, 29) (21, 14) (14, 11) (14, 21) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 25) (5, 12) (5, 25) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 6) (6, 0) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 23) (6, 1) (25, 4) (25, 9) (25, 14) (25, 5) (25, 12) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 6) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 18) (12, 23) (18, 28) (18, 14) (18, 12) (23, 14) (23, 6) (23, 12) 

Response:
Following the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle <0, 3, 4, 25>
- Cycle <0, 3, 7, 4>
- Cycle <0, 4, 27, 13>
- Cycle <1, 8, 13, 29>
- Cycle <6, 0, 3, 19>
- Cycle <6, 0, 4, 19>
- Cycle <6, 1, 8, 13>
- Cycle <9, 8, 13, 27>
- Cycle <12, 0, 3, 7>
- Cycle <12, 0, 4, 27>
- Cycle <12, 5, 25, 4>
- Cycle <14, 11, 21, 29>
- Cycle <14, 18, 28, 7>
- Cycle <14, 21, 29, 13>
- Cycle <14, 23, 6, 0>
- Cycle <17, 9, 8, 1>
- Cycle <19, 3, 7, 28>
- Cycle <19, 4, 27, 13>
- Cycle <20, 0, 3, 7>
- Cycle <20, 0, 4, 27>
- Cycle <20, 2, 26, 2>
- Cycle <22, 15, 2, 20>
- Cycle <22, 16, 14, 11>
- Cycle <22, 17, 9, 8>
- Cycle <22, 24, 22, 17>
- Cycle <23, 6, 1, 8>
- Cycle <25, 4, 27, 13>
- Cycle <25, 5, 12, 0>
- Cycle <25, 12, 18, 28>
- Cycle <27, 4, 0, 3>
- Cycle <29, 13, 8, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for a chord:

- <0, 4, 27, 13> has chord (4, 13)
- <1, 8, 13, 29> has chord (8, 13)
- <6, 1, 8, 13> has chord (1, 13)
- <17, 9, 8, 1> has chord (8, 1)
- <25, 5, 12, 0> has chord (5, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 25 chordless 4-cycles found, therefore [25]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<0, 3, 7, 4>
<0, 3, 4, 25>
<0, 4, 27, 13>
<6, 0, 3, 19>
<6, 0, 4, 19>
<9, 8, 13, 27>
<12, 0, 3, 7>
<12, 0, 4, 27>
<14, 11, 21, 29>
<14, 18, 28, 7>
<14, 21, 29, 13>
<14, 23, 6, 0>
<19, 3, 7, 28>
<20, 0, 3, 7>
<20, 0, 4, 27>
<20, 2, 26, 2>
<22, 15, 2, 20>
<22, 16, 14, 11>
<22, 17, 9, 8>
<22, 24, 22, 17>
<23, 6, 1, 8>
<25, 4, 27, 13>
<25, 12, 18, 28>
<27, 4, 0, 3>
<29, 13, 8, 1>
