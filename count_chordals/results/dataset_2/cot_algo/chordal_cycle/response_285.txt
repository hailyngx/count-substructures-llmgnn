Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 2 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 5 - 3 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 5 - 3 - 4 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 1 - 6 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 1 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 6: 0 - 7 - 4 - 9 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 7: 1 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 8: 2 - 5 - 3 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 9: 2 - 8 - 7 - 4 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 10: 3 - 4 - 7 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 11: 3 - 4 - 9 - 6 - 3
- Cycle 12: 4 - 9 - 6 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 13: 5 - 8 - 7 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 14: 6 - 9 - 1 - 0 - 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 1, 5, 8, 0> has a chord between nodes 1 and 8
- <0, 5, 3, 6, 0> has a chord between nodes 3 and 6
- <0, 5, 3, 4, 7, 0> has a chord between nodes 4 and 7
- <0, 1, 6, 3, 0> has a chord between nodes 1 and 6
- <0, 1, 9, 4, 7, 0> has a chord between nodes 9 and 4
- <1, 9, 4, 7, 1> has a chord between nodes 4 and 7
- <2, 5, 3, 6, 2> has a chord between nodes 3 and 6
- <2, 8, 7, 4, 3, 2> has a chord between nodes 7 and 4

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]
