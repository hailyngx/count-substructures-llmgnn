Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 18) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 17) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 14) (19, 2) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 16) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 18) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (2, 3) (2, 19) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 17) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 9) (9, 17) (9, 10) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<1, 5, 6, 17>
<1, 5, 14, 8>
<1, 13, 10, 8>
<1, 13, 10, 9>
<1, 13, 18, 12>
<3, 5, 6, 17> 
<3, 5, 14, 8>
<3, 12, 4, 10>
<3, 12, 4, 16>
<3, 12, 18, 13>
<5, 6, 17, 9>
<5, 14, 8, 10>
<5, 14, 7, 16>
<5, 14, 7, 0>
<6, 17, 15, 0>
<7, 16, 4, 12>
<7, 16, 12, 18>
<7, 16, 18, 13>
<7, 14, 8, 10>
<9, 10, 13, 18>
<10, 4, 12, 18>
<10, 4, 16, 7>
<12, 4, 16, 7>
<12, 16, 7, 0>
<13, 18, 17, 9>
<16, 18, 17, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Among the listed cycles, the following have exactly one chord:
<1, 5, 6, 17> - Chord: (5, 6)
<1, 13, 10, 8> - Chord: (13, 10)
<1, 13, 10, 9> - Chord: (10, 9)
<1, 13, 18, 12> - Chord: (13, 18)
<3, 5, 6, 17> - Chord: (5, 6)
<3, 5, 14, 8> - Chord: (5, 14)
<3, 12, 4, 10> - Chord: (12, 4)
<3, 12, 4, 16> - Chord: (12, 16)
<3, 12, 18, 13> - Chord: (12, 18)
<5, 14, 8, 10> - Chord: (14, 8)
<5, 14, 7, 0> - Chord: (14, 7)
<7, 14, 8, 10> - Chord: (14, 8)
<9, 10, 13, 18> - Chord: (10, 13)
<12, 16, 7, 0> - Chord: (16, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
