Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 14) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 12) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (3, 1, 5, 4, 3)
- Cycle 2: (0, 4, 5, 7, 0)
- Cycle 3: (2, 1, 5, 7, 2)
- Cycle 4: (12, 1, 5, 7, 12)
- Cycle 5: (13, 3, 5, 7, 13)
- Cycle 6: (10, 8, 6, 7, 10)
- Cycle 7: (11, 9, 7, 4, 11)
- Cycle 8: (14, 13, 2, 1, 14)
- Cycle 9: (12, 2, 8, 10, 12)
- Cycle 10: (6, 8, 2, 13, 6)
- Cycle 11: (0, 4, 3, 1, 0)
- Cycle 12: (14, 12, 9, 11, 14)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <13, (3, 5, 7, 13)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7, 2)>
- <12, (1, 5, 7, 12)>
- <1, (5, 7, 0, 1)>
- <2, (13, 2, 8, 2)>
- <6, (8, 2, 13, 6)>
- <11, (9, 7, 4, 11)>
- <14, (13, 2, 1, 14)>
- <10, (8, 6, 7, 10)>
- <0, (4, 3, 1, 0)>
- <14, (9, 11, 12, 14)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the solution is [1].
