Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-7-3-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-6-9-3-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-4-6-9-3-1
- Cycle 4: 1-7-3-9-6-4-1
- Cycle 5: 2-5-6-9-3-2
- Cycle 6: 2-5-6-4-1-3-2
- Cycle 7: 2-5-6-9-8-3-2
- Cycle 8: 2-5-6-4-7-1-3-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord: (4, 3)
- Cycle 2: Chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 3: Chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 4: Chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 5: Chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 6: Chord: (5, 4)
- Cycle 7: Chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 8: Chord: (5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (4, 3), 7>
- <2, (5, 9), 3>
- <6, (5, 4), 7>
- <7, (5, 8), 3>
