Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 0) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-7-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-7-9-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-3-4-5
- Cycle 4: 5-0-4-9-5
- Cycle 5: 5-0-3-4-5
- Cycle 6: 5-0-6-9-5
- Cycle 7: 9-4-7-1-9
- Cycle 8: 9-4-0-5-9
- Cycle 9: 9-4-3-1-9
- Cycle 10: 9-6-0-5-9
- Cycle 11: 4-7-1-9-4
- Cycle 12: 4-7-3-1-4
- Cycle 13: 4-8-7-1-4
- Cycle 14: 4-8-2-9-4
- Cycle 15: 4-0-3-1-4
- Cycle 16: 7-1-3-4-7
- Cycle 17: 7-3-1-5-7
- Cycle 18: 1-7-9-4-1
- Cycle 19: 1-7-3-4-1
- Cycle 20: 1-3-0-5-1
- Cycle 21: 3-4-7-1-3
- Cycle 22: 3-4-0-5-3
- Cycle 23: 6-9-4-0-6

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 1, 4, 9>: Chords are (5, 9)
- <5, 1, 3, 4>: Chords are (5, 4)
- <5, 0, 3, 4>: Chords are (5, 4)
- <9, 4, 0, 5>: Chords are (9, 5)
- <4, 7, 1, 9>: Chords are (4, 9)
- <4, 7, 3, 1>: Chords are (4, 1)
- <7, 1, 3, 4>: Chords are (7, 4)
- <1, 7, 9, 4>: Chords are (1, 9)
- <1, 3, 0, 5>: Chords are (3, 5)
- <3, 4, 7, 1>: Chords are (3, 1)
- <6, 9, 4, 0>: Chords are (6, 4)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [11].
