Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 17) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 16) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 1) (13, 11) (13, 17) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (16, 4) (3, 18) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 18) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 14) (1, 19) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (15, 12) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
The cycles in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: (11, 13, 17, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 17, 12, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord (13, 17) and (11, 12).
- Cycle 2 has a chord (17, 12) and (13, 12).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <11, 13, 17, 12> 
- <11, 17, 12, 13>
