This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 29) (26, 16) (26, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 15) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 16) (8, 18) (8, 10) (8, 11) (2, 18) (2, 23) (28, 14) (28, 24) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 12) (29, 26) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 25) (3, 26) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 27) (11, 8) (11, 3) (15, 1) (15, 21) (15, 19) (20, 7) (20, 14) (7, 20) (7, 19) (25, 29) (25, 5) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 24) (0, 22) (0, 17) (10, 22) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 5) (6, 24) (6, 23) (6, 12) (24, 9) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 6) (24, 27) (19, 15) (19, 7) (13, 21) (13, 14) (5, 22) (5, 25) (5, 10) (5, 23) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 6) (23, 5) (27, 22) (27, 29) (27, 3) (27, 24) (14, 28) (14, 20) (14, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle <0, 17, 29, 27> (Chord: (17, 27))
- Cycle <0, 22, 18, 2> (Chord: (22, 2))
- Cycle <0, 22, 5, 25> (Chord: (22, 5))
- Cycle <1, 15, 21, 23> (Chord: (15, 23))
- Cycle <1, 4, 10, 22> (Chord: (4, 22))
- Cycle <2, 18, 22, 10> (Chord: (18, 10))
- Cycle <3, 17, 29, 26> (Chord: (17, 26))
- Cycle <3, 11, 8, 18> (Chord: (11, 18))
- Cycle <3, 26, 16, 4> (Chord: (26, 4))
- Cycle <5, 10, 4, 16> (Chord: (10, 16))
- Cycle <5, 22, 18, 8> (Chord: (22, 8))
- Cycle <5, 25, 29, 17> (Chord: (25, 17))
- Cycle <6, 12, 17, 29> (Chord: (12, 29))
- Cycle <6, 23, 21, 15> (Chord: (23, 15))
- Cycle <7, 19, 15, 1> (Chord: (19, 15))
- Cycle <7, 20, 14, 13> (Chord: (20, 14))
- Cycle <8, 18, 22, 27> (Chord: (18, 27))
- Cycle <10, 22, 18, 2> (Chord: (22, 2))
- Cycle <12, 17, 29, 26> (Chord: (17, 26))
- Cycle <13, 21, 15, 1> (Chord: (21, 1))
- Cycle <14, 13, 21, 23> (Chord: (13, 23))
- Cycle <14, 20, 7, 19> (Chord: (20, 7))
- Cycle <15, 1, 4, 16> (Chord: (1, 16))
- Cycle <16, 4, 10, 22> (Chord: (4, 22))
- Cycle <18, 2, 23, 6> (Chord: (2, 6))
- Cycle <19, 7, 20, 14> (Chord: (7, 14))
- Cycle <21, 23, 6, 12> (Chord: (23, 12))
- Cycle <22, 10, 5, 25> (Chord: (10, 25))
- Cycle <24, 6, 23, 21> (Chord: (6, 21))
- Cycle <24, 27, 22, 5> (Chord: (27, 5))
- Cycle <25, 5, 22, 18> (Chord: (5, 18))
- Cycle <26, 9, 24, 6> (Chord: (9, 24))
- Cycle <27, 22, 18, 8> (Chord: (22, 8))

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 17, 29, 27> (Chord: (17, 27))
- <1, 15, 21, 23> (Chord: (15, 23))
- <3, 17, 29, 26> (Chord: (17, 26))
- <5, 10, 4, 16> (Chord: (10, 16))
- <6, 23, 21, 15> (Chord: (23, 15))
- <7, 19, 15, 1> (Chord: (19, 15))
- <8, 18, 22, 27> (Chord: (18, 27))
- <12, 17, 29, 26> (Chord: (17, 26))
- <13, 21, 15, 1> (Chord: (21, 1))
- <14, 13, 21, 23> (Chord: (13, 23))
- <18, 2, 23, 6> (Chord: (2, 6))
- <19, 7, 20, 14> (Chord: (7, 14))
- <21, 23, 6, 12> (Chord: (23, 12))
- <22, 10, 5, 25> (Chord: (10, 25))
- <24, 6, 23, 21> (Chord: (6, 21))
- <24, 27, 22, 5> (Chord: (27, 5))
- <25, 5, 22, 18> (Chord: (5, 18))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [16].
