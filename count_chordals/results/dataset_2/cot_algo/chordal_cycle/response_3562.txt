Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 0 - 6 - 8 - 2 - 7 - 4 - 3 - 9 - 0
        - Cycle 2: 0 - 6 - 8 - 2 - 7 - 4 - 5 - 1 - 0
        - Cycle 3: 0 - 6 - 8 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 1 - 0
        - Cycle 4: 0 - 6 - 8 - 3 - 4 - 7 - 2 - 1 - 0
        - Cycle 5: 0 - 6 - 8 - 3 - 4 - 7 - 1 - 5 - 0
        - Cycle 6: 0 - 8 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 1 - 0
        - Cycle 7: 0 - 8 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 1 - 7 - 2 - 0
        - Cycle 8: 0 - 8 - 3 - 4 - 7 - 2 - 6 - 0
        - Cycle 9: 0 - 8 - 3 - 7 - 4 - 5 - 1 - 0
        - Cycle 10: 0 - 8 - 3 - 7 - 4 - 5 - 1 - 7 - 2 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - The cycle <0, 6, 8, 3, 4, 7, 2, 1> has exactly one chord: (7, 5)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There is 0 chordal 4-cycle in this graph
        
Therefore, the final count is [0].
