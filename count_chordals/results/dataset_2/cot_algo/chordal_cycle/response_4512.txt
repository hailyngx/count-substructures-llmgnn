Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 1, 9, 2, 7, 6, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (8, 6, 7, 4, 8)
- Cycle 3: (3, 6, 7, 2, 3)
- Cycle 4: (0, 3, 9, 0)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 8, 0, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has chord (1, 5). <1, (1, 5), 9>
- Cycle 2 has chord (7, 4). <2, (7, 4), 8>
- Cycle 3 has chord (6, 2). <3, (6, 2), 7>
- Cycle 4 has chord (0, 9). <4, (0, 9), 3>
- Cycle 5 has chord (4, 8). <5, (4, 8), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since all cycles identified have exactly one chord, there are no chordless cycles in this graph. Therefore, the final count is [0].
