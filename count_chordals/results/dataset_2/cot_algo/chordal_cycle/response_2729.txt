Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 4, 7)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 8, 4)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 7, 4)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 8, 4)
- Cycle 5: (1, 2, 7, 4)
- Cycle 6: (1, 2, 8, 4)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord
- <1, 6, 4, 7> has a chord (1, 4)
- <1, 6, 8, 4> has a chord (1, 8)
- <1, 3, 7, 4> has a chord (1, 7)
- <1, 3, 8, 4> has a chord (1, 8)
- <1, 2, 7, 4> has a chord (1, 7)
- <1, 2, 8, 4> has a chord (1, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [6].
