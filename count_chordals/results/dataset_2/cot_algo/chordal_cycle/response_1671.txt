- Cycle 24: (9, 10, 2, 11)
- Cycle 25: (9, 14, 12, 7)
- Cycle 26: (9, 14, 0, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 5), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (5, 7), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (5, 7), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <11, (2, 5), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <11, (2, 5), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <2, (5, 13), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <2, (5, 7), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <2, (5, 7), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <2, (5, 13), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <2, (5, 7), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <2, (5, 7), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <2, (5, 13), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <5, (7, 9), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <5, (7, 9), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <5, (7, 9), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <5, (7, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <5, (7, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <5, (7, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <5, (7, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <5, (7, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 21: <5, (7, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 22: <5, (7, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 23: <5, (7, 9), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 24: <9, (7, 5), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 25: <9, (7, 5), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 26: <9, (7, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 27: <9, (7, 6), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 28: <9, (7, 12), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 29: <9, (10, 4), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 30: <9, (10, 2), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 31: <9, (14, 12), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 32 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
- Therefore, the final count is [32].
