Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 2) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 13) (29, 15) (29, 13) (29, 18) (18, 29) (18, 22) (18, 27) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 11) (23, 25) (23, 27) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 10) (12, 27) (12, 17) (27, 18) (27, 22) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 7) (28, 6) (28, 14) (24, 26) (24, 7) (24, 14) (26, 24) (26, 0) (26, 4) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 8) (17, 12) (17, 1) (21, 3) (21, 18) (21, 5) (13, 2) (13, 29) (13, 25) (14, 28) (14, 24) (14, 19) (7, 27) (7, 24) (7, 16) (7, 10) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 19) (0, 26) (0, 25) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (19, 14) (19, 16) (19, 11) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 8) (25, 23) (25, 13) (25, 16) (25, 0) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 20) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 11) (4, 26) (4, 20) (20, 9) (20, 5) (20, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle 1: 3-15-29-18-3
2. Cycle 2: 2-15-29-18-2
3. Cycle 3: 2-15-29-13-2
4. Cycle 4: 18-29-13-25-18
5. Cycle 5: 18-22-27-23-18
6. Cycle 6: 24-26-0-25-24

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 is chordal (Chord: (15, 18))
- Cycle 2 is chordal (Chord: (15, 29))
- Cycle 3 is not chordal
- Cycle 4 is not chordal
- Cycle 5 is chordal (Chord: (22, 27))
- Cycle 6 is not chordal

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (15, 18), 3>
<2, (15, 29), 2>
