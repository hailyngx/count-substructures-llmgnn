Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 26) (11, 25) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 23) (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (29, 16) (29, 17) (29, 1) (1, 2) (1, 29) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 24) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 23) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 24) (17, 16) (17, 29) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 21) (26, 11) (26, 13) (26, 19) (21, 19) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 28) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 27) (14, 4) (25, 11) (25, 22) (25, 18) (27, 14) (27, 22) (27, 10) (6, 15) (6, 14) (24, 8) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 10) (18, 19) (18, 25) (18, 23) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 0) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 27) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 23) (10, 2) (10, 27) (10, 24) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 18) (23, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: 5-11-26-13-8-9-2-1-29-17-16-23-0-15-7-24-12-3-5
        - Cycle 2: 1-2-9-8-13-26-11-5-19-18-23-13-8-9
        - Cycle 3: 9-28-21-19-18-25-22-14-6-15-3-12-24-7-9
        - Cycle 4: 4-0-15-6-14-22-25-18-23-16-17-29-1-2-10-27-22-4
        - Cycle 5: 13-23-0-4-14-27-10-24-7-12-3-15-6-14-4-12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Cycle 1 has one chord: (13, 16)
        - Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 19)
        - Cycle 3 has one chord: (9, 19)
        - Cycle 4 has one chord: (2, 10)
        - Cycle 5 has one chord: (0, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        - The chordless cycles are: <5, 11, 26, 13>, <8, 9, 28, 21>, <18, 25, 22, 14>, <24, 10, 27, 22>

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
