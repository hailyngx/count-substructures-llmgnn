Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Chordal 4-cycles: 
<0, 27, 18, 26, (17, 15)>
<0, 21, 15, 17, (26, 20)>
<0, 8, 5, 1, (16, 4)>
<7, 9, 25, 26, (17, 15)>
<22, 23, 1, 5, (8, 0)>
<10, 3, 11, 7, (21, 15)>
<26, 17, 15, 21, (7, 10)>
<20, 12, 18, 27, (0, 21)>
<29, 9, 25, 26, (17, 15)>
<5, 8, 0, 21, (15, 17)>
<8, 24, 22, 23, (1, 5)>
<24, 19, 15, 21, (7, 17)>
<14, 8, 0, 21, (15, 17)>
<12, 18, 27, 0, (21, 15)>
<6, 25, 9, 7, (21, 10)>
<1, 22, 23, 2, (17, 15)>
<16, 1, 5, 8, (0, 27)>
<4, 15, 21, 7, (10, 17)>
<13, 9, 25, 26, (17, 15)>
<2, 17, 15, 21, (7, 10)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [19]
