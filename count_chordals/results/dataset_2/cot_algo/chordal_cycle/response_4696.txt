Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 10) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

<0, 3, 8, 10>
<0, 3, 4, 12>
<0, 3, 4, 14>
<0, 3, 8, 7>
<0, 11, 5, 2>
<0, 11, 5, 12>
<0, 11, 14, 9>
<1, 6, 12, 4>
<1, 6, 12, 14>
<1, 6, 12, 5>
<1, 13, 10, 8>
<2, 1, 6, 12>
<2, 1, 13, 10>
<2, 5, 12, 4>
<2, 9, 14, 4>
<3, 0, 14, 4>
<4, 3, 8, 10>
<4, 3, 8, 7>
<4, 11, 5, 12>
<4, 11, 0, 14>
<4, 12, 1, 6>
<4, 12, 14, 9>
<5, 2, 9, 14>
<5, 10, 8, 7>
<5, 10, 13, 1>
<5, 11, 6, 1>
<6, 1, 13, 10>
<7, 8, 10, 13>
<7, 8, 3, 0>
<7, 9, 14, 4>
<7, 10, 13, 1>
<8, 3, 0, 11>
<8, 3, 4, 14>
<9, 14, 4, 12>
<9, 14, 12, 6>
<10, 8, 3, 4>
<11, 0, 3, 8>
<11, 4, 12, 1>
<12, 1, 6, 2>
<12, 4, 11, 0>
<13, 1, 6, 12>
<14, 4, 3, 0>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <0, 3, 8, 10>, with a chord between nodes 3 and 8.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord is [1].
