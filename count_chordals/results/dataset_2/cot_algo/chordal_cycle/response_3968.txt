Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 12) (16, 10) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 15) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 15) (2, 8) (2, 19) (0, 4) (0, 15) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 1) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 2) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 0) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 3) 

Response:
Step 1:  
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (11, 3, 5, 12, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 12, 15, 0, 11)
- Cycle 3: (16, 10, 18, 17, 16)
- Cycle 4: (14, 17, 18, 10, 14)
- Cycle 5: (14, 4, 19, 10, 14)
- Cycle 6: (17, 18, 10, 16, 17)
- Cycle 7: (4, 19, 2, 8, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 6, 14, 17, 7)
- Cycle 9: (10, 16, 17, 14, 10)
- Cycle 10: (8, 15, 12, 5, 8)
- Cycle 11: (12, 15, 0, 4, 12)
- Cycle 12: (2, 19, 4, 14, 2)
- Cycle 13: (0, 15, 8, 2, 0)
- Cycle 14: (3, 5, 12, 15, 3)
- Cycle 15: (5, 13, 9, 3, 5)
- Cycle 16: (13, 1, 6, 11, 13)
- Cycle 17: (9, 3, 11, 6, 9)
- Cycle 18: (1, 6, 7, 9, 1)
- Cycle 19: (19, 2, 8, 15, 19)
- Cycle 20: (18, 10, 16, 3, 18)

Step 2:  
Among all the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<1, (6, 11), 13>

Step 3:
By counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found in Step 2, we have [1].
