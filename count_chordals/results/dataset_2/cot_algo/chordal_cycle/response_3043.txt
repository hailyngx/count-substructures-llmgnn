Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 4) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 0 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 9 - 3 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 13 - 12 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 13 - 11 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 5: 6 - 10 - 2 - 14 - 6
- Cycle 6: 9 - 0 - 10 - 14 - 9
- Cycle 7: 1 - 3 - 8 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 8: 1 - 0 - 10 - 11 - 1
- Cycle 9: 3 - 4 - 2 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 10: 3 - 8 - 14 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 11: 8 - 12 - 5 - 11 - 8
- Cycle 12: 8 - 7 - 0 - 14 - 8
- Cycle 13: 13 - 6 - 3 - 4 - 13
- Cycle 14: 13 - 12 - 5 - 11 - 13
- Cycle 15: 10 - 4 - 2 - 7 - 10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, 9, 0, 1> has one chord: (9, 1)
- <6, 9, 3, 8> has one chord: (9, 8)
- <6, 13, 12, 8> has one chord: (13, 8)
- <6, 13, 11, 5> has one chord: (13, 5)
- <6, 10, 2, 14> has one chord: (10, 14)
- <9, 0, 10, 14> has one chord: (0, 10)
- <1, 3, 8, 7> has one chord: (3, 8)
- <1, 0, 10, 11> has one chord: (0, 10)
- <3, 4, 2, 7> has one chord: (4, 7)
- <3, 8, 14, 0> has one chord: (8, 14)
- <8, 12, 5, 11> has one chord: (12, 5)
- <8, 7, 0, 14> has one chord: (7, 14)
- <13, 6, 3, 4> has one chord: (6, 4)
- <13, 12, 5, 11> has one chord: (12, 11)
- <10, 4, 2, 7> has one chord: (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [15]
