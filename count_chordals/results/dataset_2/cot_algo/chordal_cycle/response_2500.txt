Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 0) (2, 29) (2, 5) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 24) (7, 8) (21, 6) (21, 26) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 4) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 8) (8, 7) (8, 25) (8, 23) (8, 18) (23, 13) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 0) (23, 12) (10, 12) (10, 20) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 12) (20, 14) (20, 10) (20, 19) (20, 28) (12, 23) (12, 10) (12, 15) (12, 18) (11, 19) (11, 9) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 9) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 4) (16, 29) (16, 15) (16, 28) (5, 2) (5, 19) (19, 17) (19, 20) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 18) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 26) (26, 21) (26, 18) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 6) (0, 22) (0, 23) (0, 15) (0, 9) (9, 11) (9, 28) (9, 0) (9, 27) (24, 29) (24, 14) (24, 27) (27, 17) (27, 9) (27, 24) (4, 17) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 22, 29, 24> (cycle of length 4)
- <1, 6, 21, 26> (cycle of length 4)
- <4, 6, 21, 26> (cycle of length 4)
- <8, 23, 0, 22> (cycle of length 4)
- <8, 25, 3, 1> (cycle of length 4)
- <10, 12, 23, 0> (cycle of length 4)
- <14, 24, 29, 2> (cycle of length 4)
- <15, 12, 10, 20> (cycle of length 4)
- <16, 28, 20, 10> (cycle of length 4)
- <17, 19, 11, 9> (cycle of length 4)
- <18, 14, 24, 29> (cycle of length 4)
- <18, 19, 5, 2> (cycle of length 4)
- <18, 26, 21, 6> (cycle of length 4)
- <19, 17, 14, 24> (cycle of length 4)
- <19, 18, 12, 10> (cycle of length 4)
- <20, 14, 17, 19> (cycle of length 4)
- <27, 24, 29, 16> (cycle of length 4)

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 22, 29, 24> has chord (0, 29)
- <1, 6, 21, 26> has chord (1, 26)
- <8, 23, 0, 22> has chord (8, 22)
- <14, 24, 29, 2> has chord (24, 29)
- <15, 12, 10, 20> has chord (12, 10)
- <16, 28, 20, 10> has chord (28, 20)
- <17, 19, 11, 9> has chord (19, 11)
- <27, 24, 29, 16> has chord (24, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 22, 29, 24> with chord (0, 29)
- <1, 6, 21, 26> with chord (1, 26)
- <8, 23, 0, 22> with chord (8, 22)
- <14, 24, 29, 2> with chord (24, 29)
- <15, 12, 10, 20> with chord (12, 10)
- <16, 28, 20, 10> with chord (28, 20)
- <17, 19, 11, 9> with chord (19, 11)
- <27, 24, 29, 16> with chord (24, 16)
