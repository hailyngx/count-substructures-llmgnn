Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 17) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (0, 16) (0, 14) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (4, 14) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 7) (17, 15) (17, 1) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 5) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 10) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        
        - Cycle 1: <0, 16, 12, 14, 0>
        - Cycle 2: <1, 15, 9, 11, 1>
        - Cycle 3: <2, 18, 5, 1, 2>
        - Cycle 4: <3, 12, 14, 0, 3>
        - Cycle 5: <5, 18, 2, 6, 5>
        - Cycle 6: <6, 2, 14, 0, 6>
        - Cycle 7: <7, 1, 17, 15, 7>
        - Cycle 8: <8, 2, 18, 5, 8>
        - Cycle 9: <9, 11, 16, 0, 9>
        - Cycle 10: <10, 3, 12, 14, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - <0, 16, 12, (14), 0>
        - <1, 15, (9), 11, 1>
        - <2, 18, (5), 1, 2>
        - <3, 12, (14), 0, 3>
        - <5, 18, (2), 6, 5>
        - <6, 2, (14), 0, 6>
        - <7, 1, (17), 15, 7>
        - <8, 2, (18), 5, 8>
        - <9, 11, (16), 0, 9>
        - <10, 3, (12), 14, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        
        As every cycle has exactly one chord, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
