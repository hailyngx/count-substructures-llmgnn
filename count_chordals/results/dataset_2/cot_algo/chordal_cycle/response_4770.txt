Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 11) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
1. Cycle 1: 6-5-11-9-6 
2. Cycle 2: 6-3-0-13-8-6 
3. Cycle 3: 6-7-1-13-0-3-6 
4. Cycle 4: 6-12-8-13-1-7-6 
5. Cycle 5: 9-2-3-0-13-1-9 
6. Cycle 6: 9-11-5-6-7-14-9 
7. Cycle 7: 9-0-3-14-2-11-9 
8. Cycle 8: 8-13-1-7-14-2-8 
9. Cycle 9: 13-0-3-2-14-1-13 
10. Cycle 10: 4-8-13-1-11-5-4 
11. Cycle 11: 4-11-2-3-0-10-4 

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
1. Cycle 4: 6-12-8-13-1-7-6 

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <6-12-8-13-1-7>.
