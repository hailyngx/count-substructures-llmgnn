Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
    - There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2: 
    - No chordal 4-cycles can be found in the graph.

Step 3:
    - The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
