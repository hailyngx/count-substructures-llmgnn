Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 13) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 5, 6, 4)
- Cycle 2: (5, 6, 2, 8, 5)
- Cycle 3: (6, 2, 9, 13, 6)
- Cycle 4: (2, 8, 3, 11, 2)
- Cycle 5: (8, 3, 14, 12, 8)
- Cycle 6: (3, 11, 12, 9, 3)
- Cycle 7: (11, 12, 1, 13, 11)
- Cycle 8: (12, 1, 0, 2, 12)
- Cycle 9: (1, 0, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 10: (0, 10, 5, 8, 0)
- Cycle 11: (10, 6, 13, 11, 10)
- Cycle 12: (14, 3, 8, 5, 14)
- Cycle 13: (9, 1, 13, 10, 9)
- Cycle 14: (13, 10, 0, 2, 13)
- Cycle 15: (4, 9, 2, 6, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (3, 11)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (3, 12)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (12, 1)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (2, 12)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (0, 9)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (0, 10)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (6, 13)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (8, 5)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (1, 13)
- Cycle 14 has a chord: (0, 2)
- Cycle 15 has a chord: (2, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 13 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [13].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (0, 9), 4, 7, 5>
- <2, (2, 8), 5, 6, 2>
- <3, (3, 11), 2, 8, 5>
- <4, (3, 12), 9, 2, 6>
- <5, (12, 1), 4, 9, 2>
- <6, (2, 12), 8, 5, 12>
- <7, (0, 9), 1, 4, 9>
- <8, (0, 10), 5, 8, 0>
- <9, (6, 13), 2, 6, 10>
- <10, (8, 5), 3, 14, 12>
- <11, (1, 13), 9, 10, 13>
- <12, (0, 2), 10, 5, 13>
- <13, (2, 6), 9, 4, 1>
