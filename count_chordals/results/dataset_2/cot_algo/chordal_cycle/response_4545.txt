Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 11, 3, 4, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 4, 12, 14, 2, 0, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 0, 7, 9, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 2, 6, 4, 9, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 1, 11, 3, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 1, 11, 8, 10, 6, 4, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 4, 3, 11, 1, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 4, 12, 14, 2, 0, 7, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 7, 0, 5, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 7, 0, 2, 6, 4, 9)
- Cycle 11: (4, 3, 11, 1, 9, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 12, 14, 2, 5, 9, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 6, 10, 8, 11, 3, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 6, 10, 13, 12, 14, 2, 4)
- Cycle 15: (7, 0, 5, 9, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 0, 2, 6, 4, 9, 7)
- Cycle 17: (6, 2, 0, 7, 9, 5, 6)
- Cycle 18: (6, 2, 0, 5, 9, 4, 6)
- Cycle 19: (6, 4, 9, 7, 0, 2, 6)
- Cycle 20: (6, 4, 9, 5, 0, 7, 6)
- Cycle 21: (10, 8, 11, 3, 4, 6, 10)
- Cycle 22: (10, 8, 11, 1, 9, 4, 6, 10)
- Cycle 23: (10, 6, 4, 9, 1, 11, 8, 10)
- Cycle 24: (10, 6, 4, 12, 14, 13, 3, 11, 8, 10)
- Cycle 25: (11, 1, 9, 7, 0, 2, 14, 13, 3, 11)
- Cycle 26: (11, 3, 4, 12, 14, 2, 0, 8, 10, 6, 11)
- Cycle 27: (12, 14, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1, 11, 3, 13, 12)
- Cycle 28: (3, 11, 1, 9, 7, 0, 5, 2, 14, 13, 3)
- Cycle 29: (0, 2, 6, 10, 8, 11, 3, 13, 14, 7, 0)
- Cycle 30: (14, 2, 0, 5, 9, 1, 11, 8, 10, 13, 14)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:

- Cycle 4: Chord: (6, 9) -> <4, (6, 9), 2>
- Cycle 12: Chord: (9, 4) -> <12, (9, 4), 14>
- Cycle 18: Chord: (2, 0) -> <18, (2, 0), 7>
- Cycle 20: Chord: (5, 9) -> <20, (5, 9), 7>
- Cycle 22: Chord: (9, 6) -> <22, (9, 6), 10>
- Cycle 24: Chord: (4, 13) -> <24, (4, 13), 6>
- Cycle 25: Chord: (9, 7) -> <25, (9, 7), 4>
- Cycle 27: Chord: (13, 3) -> <27, (13, 3), 11>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:

There are 30 cycles, and we found 7 chordal cycles. So, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph is [23].
