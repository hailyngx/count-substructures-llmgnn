Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 7) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 7) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 19) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 12) (0, 11) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 15) (14, 3) (16, 18) (16, 1) (17, 4) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 2-9-13-10-2
- Cycle 2: 4-12-13-10-4
- Cycle 3: 1-6-2-9-1
- Cycle 4: 11-10-13-12-11
- Cycle 5: 18-2-9-13-18
- Cycle 6: 16-1-6-4-16

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (9, 13), 1> with chord 9-13
- <4, (13, 10), 4> with chord 13-10
- <1, (2, 9), 1> with chord 2-9
- <11, (13, 12), 11> with chord 13-12
- <16, (2, 9), 16> with chord 2-9
- <6, (1, 4), 6> with chord 1-4

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [6].
