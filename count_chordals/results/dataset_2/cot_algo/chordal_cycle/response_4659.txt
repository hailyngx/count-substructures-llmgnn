Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 25) (4, 29) (7, 28) (3, 23) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 18) (25, 4) (25, 23) (25, 10) (10, 25) (10, 6) (10, 19) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 17) (22, 20) (22, 29) (28, 7) (28, 29) (29, 4) (29, 22) (29, 28) (29, 27) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 24) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 21) (8, 27) (5, 21) (5, 20) (13, 4) (1, 17) (1, 20) (1, 16) (1, 24) (1, 9) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 21) (14, 26) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 27) (0, 18) (0, 17) (0, 16) (16, 2) (16, 1) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 20) (12, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 24) (20, 22) (20, 5) (20, 1) (20, 16) (27, 29) (27, 8) (27, 26) (27, 6) (24, 2) (24, 1) (24, 9) (6, 10) (6, 27) (23, 3) (23, 25) (23, 21) (23, 19) (15, 17) (15, 14) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 23) (21, 8) (21, 5) (21, 17) (21, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

        - Cycle 1: (4, 25, 23, 3, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 25, 10, 19, 14, 26, 16, 2, 8, 3, 4)
        - Cycle 3: (7, 28, 29, 4, 25, 23, 3, 8, 2, 16, 1, 17, 18, 3, 7)
        - Cycle 4: (7, 28, 29, 22, 20, 21, 8, 3, 18, 17, 1, 16, 26, 27, 6, 10, 25, 4, 7)
        - Cycle 5: (7, 28, 29, 27, 26, 16, 0, 17, 21, 5, 20, 22, 29, 28, 7)
        - Cycle 6: (4, 29, 27, 26, 16, 0, 18, 3, 9, 24, 2, 8, 21, 5, 20, 22, 29, 4)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 23, 25, 10, 6, 27, 29, 4, 13, 1, 9, 24, 2, 8, 21, 17, 18, 0, 16, 26, 14, 19, 23, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

        - <1, (3, 25), 4>
        - <2, (4, 14), 3>
        - <3, (7, 18), 28>
        - <4, (7, 22), 28>
        - <5, (7, 26), 28>
        - <6, (4, 26), 29>
        - <7, (3, 19), 23>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

        There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [7].
