Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 14) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 15) (19, 0) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 15) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 15) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 14) (13, 10) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: 1-5-6-3-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-2-10-1
- Cycle 3: 1-17-16-12-1
- Cycle 4: 3-9-6-5-3
- Cycle 5: 3-14-10-2-3
- Cycle 6: 4-5-6-9-4
- Cycle 7: 4-18-9-6-4
- Cycle 8: 7-10-2-5-7
- Cycle 9: 7-18-9-4-7
- Cycle 10: 15-16-17-1-15
- Cycle 11: 15-8-15
- Cycle 12: 15-7-10-14-15
- Cycle 13: 15-12-16-17-15
- Cycle 14: 15-14-10-3-15
- Cycle 15: 12-16-17-1-12
- Cycle 16: 12-18-9-3-12
- Cycle 17: 12-13-10-14-12

Step 2: Identify the chordal 4-cycle by looking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (12, 16), 17, 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, (9, 6), 5, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (9, 6), 5, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, (18, 4), 9, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <15, (16, 17), 1, 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <15, (10, 14), 3, 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <12, (16, 17), 1, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [10]
