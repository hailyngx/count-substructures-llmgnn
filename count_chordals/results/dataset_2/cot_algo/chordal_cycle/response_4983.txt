Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (9, 6, 5, 8, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 8, 13, 6, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 4, 12, 8, 9)
- Cycle 4: (8, 13, 6, 9, 8)
- Cycle 5: (8, 5, 6, 9, 8)
- Cycle 6: (8, 2, 0, 14, 8)
- Cycle 7: (13, 5, 6, 9, 13)
- Cycle 8: (13, 11, 10, 14, 13)
- Cycle 9: (11, 3, 4, 12, 11)
- Cycle 10: (5, 7, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 11: (2, 0, 14, 11, 2)
- Cycle 12: (0, 1, 9, 14, 0)
- Cycle 13: (14, 4, 12, 8, 14)
- Cycle 14: (7, 1, 9, 5, 7)
- Cycle 15: (3, 4, 9, 1, 3)
- Cycle 16: (4, 12, 8, 13, 4)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:

- <6, (9, 8), 5, 6>  (Chord: (9, 8))
- <6, 13, (8, 9), 6>  (Chord: (8, 9))
- <9, (8, 13), 6, 9>  (Chord: (8, 13))
- <8, 13, (6, 9), 8>  (Chord: (6, 9))
- <8, 5, (6, 9), 8>  (Chord: (6, 9))
- <8, 2, (0, 14), 8>  (Chord: (0, 14))
- <13, 5, (6, 9), 13>  (Chord: (6, 9))
- <13, 11, (10, 14), 13>  (Chord: (10, 14))
- <11, 3, (4, 12), 11>  (Chord: (4, 12))
- <5, 7, (1, 9), 5>  (Chord: (1, 9))
- <2, 0, (14, 11), 2>  (Chord: (14, 11))
- <0, 1, (9, 14), 0>  (Chord: (9, 14))
- <14, 4, (8, 12), 14>  (Chord: (8, 12))
- <7, 1, (9, 5), 7>  (Chord: (9, 5))
- <3, 4, (9, 1), 3>  (Chord: (9, 1))
- <12, (4, 8), 13, 12>  (Chord: (4, 8))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [16]
