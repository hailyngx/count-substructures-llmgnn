Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 0-1-3-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-4-6-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-6-2-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1: 0-1-3-6-0 (Chord: 1-6)
- Cycle 2: 0-1-4-6-0 (Chord: 1-6)
- Cycle 3: 0-3-6-2-0 (Chord: 3-6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
As all cycles have exactly one chord, there are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 1, 3, 6> (Chord: (1, 6))
<0, 1, 4, 6> (Chord: (1, 6))
<0, 3, 6, 2> (Chord: (3, 6))
