Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges.

- Cycle 39: (16, 1, 10, 25)
- Cycle 40: (16, 1, 10, 25)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The only cycle with exactly one chord is the cycle <8, (23, 24), 28).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final answer is [1].
