Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 6, 1, 4, 5)
- (5, 4, 7, 3, 5)
- (5, 8, 9, 7, 5)
- (6, 5, 4, 3, 6)
- (6, 1, 7, 3, 6)
- (6, 2, 3, 7, 6)
- (1, 6, 5, 4, 1)
- (1, 7, 4, 3, 1)
- (3, 6, 5, 4, 3)
- (3, 7, 4, 1, 3)
- (4, 5, 6, 1, 4)
- (4, 7, 3, 1, 4)
- (7, 9, 8, 3, 7)
- (7, 1, 6, 3, 7)
- (2, 5, 4, 3, 2)
- (2, 8, 3, 7, 2)
- (8, 5, 4, 7, 8)
- (8, 9, 7, 3, 8)
- (0, 9, 8, 7, 0)
- (0, 4, 5, 6, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal cycles:
- <5, 2, 3, 4, 5>
- <5, 8, 9, 7, 5>
- <6, 1, 4, 3, 6>
- <6, 2, 3, 7, 6>
- <1, 7, 4, 3, 1>
- <3, 7, 4, 1, 3>
- <4, 5, 6, 1, 4>
- <8, 9, 7, 3, 8>
- <0, 9, 8, 7, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [9].
