Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (7, 6, 5, 8, 7)
        - Cycle 2: (7, 6, 3, 0, 7)
        - Cycle 3: (7, 6, 4, 8, 7)
        - Cycle 4: (7, 5, 8, 3, 7)
        - Cycle 5: (6, 4, 7, 9, 6)
        - Cycle 6: (6, 7, 9, 2, 6)
        - Cycle 7: (6, 5, 8, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 8: (5, 7, 9, 2, 5)
        - Cycle 9: (5, 8, 4, 0, 5)
        - Cycle 10: (8, 5, 6, 3, 8)
        - Cycle 11: (8, 4, 7, 9, 8)
        - Cycle 12: (4, 7, 9, 0, 4)
        - Cycle 13: (7, 9, 2, 3, 7)
        - Cycle 14: (9, 2, 7, 4, 9)
        - Cycle 15: (2, 3, 6, 4, 2)
        - Cycle 16: (3, 0, 4, 8, 3)
        - Cycle 17: (0, 1, 8, 3, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Cycle 1 has chords (6, 8)
        - Cycle 2 has chords (6, 0)
        - Cycle 3 has chords (6, 4)
        - Cycle 4 has chords (5, 3)
        - Cycle 8 has chords (7, 9)
        - Cycle 12 has chords (7, 0)
        - Cycle 13 has chords (2, 3)
        - Cycle 14 has chords (2, 7)
        - Cycle 15 has chords (3, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

        There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Putting the final count inside brackets, the answer is [5].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        - <1, (6, 8), 5)>
        - <2, (6, 0), 7)>
        - <3, (6, 4), 4)>
        - <4, (5, 3), 7)>
        - <5, (3, 4), 2)>
