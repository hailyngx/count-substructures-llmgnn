Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 12) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 5) (10, 17) (10, 2) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 13) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 13) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 14) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 18) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 12, 16, 4)
- Cycle 2: (10, 17, 12, 7, 4, 10)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 4, 11, 0, 5)
- Cycle 4: (2, 6, 13, 12, 7, 2)
- Cycle 5: (17, 12, 13, 6, 2, 17)
- Cycle 6: (14, 0, 11, 16, 12, 14)
- Cycle 7: (15, 2, 10, 17, 4, 15)
- Cycle 8: (18, 14, 0, 11, 4, 18)
- Cycle 9: (9, 18, 14, 0, 19, 9)
- Cycle 10: (3, 6, 13, 12, 16, 3)
- Cycle 11: (19, 0, 11, 4, 7, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (4, 16)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (12, 10)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (7, 11)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (6, 12)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (13, 17)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (0, 14)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (10, 15)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (4, 18)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (0, 18)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (6, 16)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (7, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the answer is [11].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (4, 16), 4, 7, 12>
<2, (12, 10), 17, 10, 7>
<3, (7, 11), 4, 5, 7>
<4, (6, 12), 13, 6, 2>
<5, (13, 17), 12, 7, 4>
<6, (0, 14), 11, 0, 19>
<7, (10, 15), 17, 2, 6>
<8, (4, 18), 11, 4, 7>
<9, (0, 18), 14, 0, 19>
<10, (6, 16), 13, 6, 3>
<11, (7, 19), 4, 7, 0>
