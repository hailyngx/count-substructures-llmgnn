Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-0-5
- Cycle 2: 5-8-2-1-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-2-8-5
- Cycle 4: 9-5-1-2-9
- Cycle 5: 9-4-2-8-9
- Cycle 6: 4-9-2-1-4
- Cycle 7: 4-0-7-3-4
- Cycle 8: 7-0-4-9-7
- Cycle 9: 8-5-1-2-8
- Cycle 10: 8-2-1-5-8
- Cycle 11: 8-6-0-7-8
- Cycle 12: 2-9-4-0-2
- Cycle 13: 2-4-0-7-2
- Cycle 14: 2-8-6-1-2
- Cycle 15: 2-1-5-8-2
- Cycle 16: 2-6-0-4-2
- Cycle 17: 0-5-1-7-0
- Cycle 18: 0-4-7-3-0
- Cycle 19: 0-7-3-5-0
- Cycle 20: 1-5-9-2-1
- Cycle 21: 1-7-3-5-1
- Cycle 22: 1-8-6-0-1
- Cycle 23: 1-2-4-0-1
- Cycle 24: 1-6-0-4-1
- Cycle 25: 6-8-2-1-6
- Cycle 26: 6-2-4-0-6
- Cycle 27: 6-0-7-3-6
- Cycle 28: 3-5-1-7-3
- Cycle 29: 3-9-4-0-3
- Cycle 30: 3-7-0-4-3

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 2 has exactly 1 chord (2,8), hence, <2, (2,8), 8>
- Cycle 3 has exactly 1 chord (1,8), hence, <3, (1,8), 1>
- Cycle 4 has exactly 1 chord (1,2), hence, <4, (1,2), 5>
- Cycle 5 has exactly 1 chord (9,2), hence, <5, (9,2), 8>
- Cycle 6 has exactly 1 chord (1,2), hence, <6, (1,2), 4>
- Cycle 9 has exactly 1 chord (1,2), hence, <9, (1,2), 8>
- Cycle 10 has exactly 1 chord (1,5), hence, <10, (1,5), 8>
- Cycle 11 has exactly 1 chord (0,7), hence, <11, (0,7), 8>
- Cycle 12 has exactly 1 chord (0,4), hence, <12, (0,4), 2>
- Cycle 15 has exactly 1 chord (1,5), hence, <15, (1,5), 8>
- Cycle 16 has exactly 1 chord (0,4), hence, <16, (0,4), 2>
- Cycle 20 has exactly 1 chord (1,9), hence, <20, (1,9), 5>
- Cycle 22 has exactly 1 chord (0,6), hence, <22, (0,6), 8>

Step 3:
Final number of chordal 4-cycles: [12]
