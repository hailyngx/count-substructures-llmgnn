Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 13) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 3) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 13) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 12) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 7) (12, 10) (19, 15) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 5) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 16) (8, 6) (8, 10) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 14) (7, 9) (7, 15) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (14, 16) (14, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <6, 4, 18, 3>
- Cycle 2: <6, 9, 15, 10>
- Cycle 3: <17, 6, 4, 13>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 18, 4>
- Cycle 5: <10, 8, 6, 4>
- Cycle 6: <11, 3, 18, 4>
- Cycle 7: <15, 7, 9, 13>
- Cycle 8: <1, 2, 18, 4>
- Cycle 9: <5, 11, 3, 18>
- Cycle 10: <16, 17, 6, 4>
- Cycle 11: <16, 1, 2, 18>
- Cycle 12: <16, 5, 11, 3>
- Cycle 13: <13, 1, 2, 18>

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, 4, 18, 3> has a chord (4, 18)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, 9, 15, 10> has a chord (9, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <17, 6, 4, 13> has a chord (6, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 3, 18, 4> has a chord (3, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <10, 8, 6, 4> has a chord (8, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <11, 3, 18, 4> has a chord (3, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <15, 7, 9, 13> has a chord (7, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, 2, 18, 4> has a chord (2, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <5, 11, 3, 18> has a chord (11, 18)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <16, 17, 6, 4> has a chord (17, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <16, 1, 2, 18> has a chord (1, 18)
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <16, 5, 11, 3> has a chord (5, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <13, 1, 2, 18> has a chord (1, 18)

Step 3:
Number of chordless 4-cycles = [0]
