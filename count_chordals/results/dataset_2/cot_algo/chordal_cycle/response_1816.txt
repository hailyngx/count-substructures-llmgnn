Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 7) (9, 0) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 7) (18, 15) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 16) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 4) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 7) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 4) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 11) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 6) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
  
The cycles in this graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-9-0
- Cycle 2: 1-2-17-11-1
- Cycle 3: 1-10-15-4-3-13-1
- Cycle 4: 1-19-8-7-2-1
- Cycle 5: 2-16-4-13-17-2
- Cycle 6: 3-14-11-17-2-1-10-3
- Cycle 7: 3-12-13-4-16-0-5-3
- Cycle 8: 4-16-2-1-10-15-4
- Cycle 9: 6-8-7-3-4-16-6
- Cycle 10: 6-19-8-7-9-0-16-6
- Cycle 11: 6-11-14-3-4-13-6
- Cycle 12: 7-9-0-16-4-13-3-7
- Cycle 13: 8-19-1-10-15-18-8
- Cycle 14: 11-14-3-7-2-17-11
- Cycle 15: 12-13-3-7-2-1-10-12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 6: 3-14-11-17-2-1-10-3 (Chord: 3-10)
- Cycle 7: 3-12-13-4-16-0-5-3 (Chord: 12-5)
- Cycle 9: 6-8-7-3-4-16-6 (Chord: 8-4)
- Cycle 11: 6-11-14-3-4-13-6 (Chord: 11-13)
- Cycle 13: 8-19-1-10-15-18-8 (Chord: 19-15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 15 chordal 4-cycles in the graph. Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [15].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<6, (3, 10)>
<7, (12, 5)>
<9, (8, 4)>
<11, (11, 13)>
<13, (19, 15)>
