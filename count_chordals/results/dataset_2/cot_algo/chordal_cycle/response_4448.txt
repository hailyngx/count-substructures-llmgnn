Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 9, 7, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 2, 4, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 0, 5, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 3, 0, 9, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 3, 0, 6, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 5, 9, 7, 1> contains a chord (5, 7)
- <1, 5, 4, 9, 1> contains a chord (5, 9)
- <1, 5, 4, 7, 1> contains a chord (5, 7)
- <1, 3, 2, 4, 1> contains a chord (3, 4)
- <1, 3, 0, 5, 1> contains a chord (3, 5)
- <1, 3, 0, 9, 1> contains a chord (3, 9)
- <1, 3, 0, 6, 1> contains a chord (3, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, which are:
- <1, 5, 9, 7, 1>
- <1, 5, 4, 9, 1>
- <1, 5, 4, 7, 1>
- <1, 3, 0, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of chordless cycles found is [4].
