Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 14) (18, 16) (22, 15) (22, 20) (22, 21) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 27) (23, 8) (23, 29) (23, 27) (4, 8) (4, 29) (4, 2) (15, 22) (15, 20) (15, 24) (20, 22) (20, 15) (20, 19) (20, 10) (27, 13) (27, 23) (27, 9) (21, 22) (21, 28) (21, 26) (21, 17) (28, 21) (28, 5) (28, 10) (1, 26) (1, 9) (26, 21) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 6) (7, 25) (7, 24) (25, 7) (25, 5) (25, 29) (25, 2) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 17) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 17) (19, 20) (19, 24) (19, 3) (14, 18) (14, 26) (14, 3) (5, 28) (5, 26) (5, 25) (5, 11) (11, 0) (11, 5) (24, 15) (24, 7) (24, 19) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 14) (17, 21) (17, 0) (17, 16) (6, 26) (6, 10) (29, 23) (29, 4) (29, 25) (9, 27) (9, 1) (10, 20) (10, 28) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 4) (2, 25) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (8, 13, 27, 23)
- Cycle 2: (15, 22, 20, 19)
- Cycle 3: (21, 22, 20, 19)
- Cycle 4: (21, 28, 5, 26)
- Cycle 5: (21, 17, 0, 16)
- Cycle 6: (21, 17, 0, 11)
- Cycle 7: (21, 26, 14, 18)
- Cycle 8: (21, 26, 14, 3)
- Cycle 9: (21, 26, 5, 11)
- Cycle 10: (21, 26, 5, 28)
- Cycle 11: (21, 17, 16, 0)
- Cycle 12: (21, 17, 16, 15)
- Cycle 13: (21, 17, 0, 11, 5)
- Cycle 14: (21, 26, 14, 3, 8)
- Cycle 15: (21, 26, 5, 11, 0)
- Cycle 16: (21, 26, 5, 28, 10)
- Cycle 17: (21, 17, 16, 0, 11)
- Cycle 18: (21, 26, 14, 18, 16)
- Cycle 19: (21, 26, 5, 11, 0, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycle found is <13, 8, (27, 23), 23>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 18 chordless 4-cycles found in the graph. 

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
