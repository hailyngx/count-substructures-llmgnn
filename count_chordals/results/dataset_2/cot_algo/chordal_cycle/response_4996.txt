Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles present in the graph, but we are interested in those that form a chordal 4-cycle, meaning they have a chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

<1, 9, 14, 10> with chord (1, 14)
<1, 5, 13, 10> with chord (5, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Both of the cycles listed above have exactly one chord each, so they meet the criteria for being chordal 4-cycles.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are a total of [2] chordal 4-cycles identified in the given graph.
