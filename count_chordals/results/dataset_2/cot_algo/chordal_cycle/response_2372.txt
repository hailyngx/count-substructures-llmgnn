Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 2, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 8, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 0, 5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 6, 5, 0, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 1, 4, 0, 2)
- Cycle 6: (4, 8, 7, 2, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 8: (5, 6, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 6, 2, 0, 5)
- Cycle 10: (6, 1, 4, 8, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 5, 0, 2, 6)
- Cycle 12: (8, 4, 1, 6, 8)
- Cycle 13: (8, 4, 0, 2, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 7, 1, 6, 8)
- Cycle 15: (8, 7, 2, 4, 8)
- Cycle 16: (9, 1, 4, 0, 9)
- Cycle 17: (9, 1, 6, 5, 9)
- Cycle 18: (9, 3, 5, 0, 9)
- Cycle 19: (9, 3, 8, 7, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord (2, 4)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (0, 5)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (6, 2)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (4, 1)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (7, 2)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (5, 4)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (6, 5)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 11 has a chord (1, 0)
- Cycle 12 has a chord (6, 1)
- Cycle 13 has a chord (4, 0)
- Cycle 14 has a chord (6, 2)
- Cycle 15 has a chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 16 has a chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 17 has a chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 18 has a chord (3, 0)
- Cycle 19 has a chord (8, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles.
There are a total of 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<[1, (2, 4)], [2, (8, 4)], [3, (0, 5)], [4, (6, 2)], [5, (4, 1)], [6, (7, 2)], [7, (1, 8)], [8, (5, 4)], [9, (6, 5)], [10, (8, 4)], [11, (1, 0)], [13, (4, 0)], [15, (8, 4)]> 

So, the final count is [13].
