Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
Following the steps provided, we can count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 6, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 5, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 0, 9, 7, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 0, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 2, 5, 7, 1)
- Cycle 6: (3, 6, 2, 9, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 6, 8, 7, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 1, 0, 9, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 1, 2, 5, 3)
- Cycle 10: (4, 7, 9, 0, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 7, 5, 2, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 5, 3, 0, 4)
- Cycle 13: (7, 9, 0, 1, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 9, 8, 5, 7)
- Cycle 15: (0, 9, 7, 5, 0)
- Cycle 16: (0, 9, 8, 1, 0)
- Cycle 17: (0, 1, 3, 5, 0)
- Cycle 18: (2, 6, 8, 1, 2)
- Cycle 19: (2, 6, 3, 5, 2)
- Cycle 20: (2, 1, 0, 9, 2)
- Cycle 21: (2, 1, 3, 5, 2)
- Cycle 22: (8, 6, 3, 1, 8)
- Cycle 23: (8, 6, 2, 5, 8)
- Cycle 24: (8, 9, 7, 5, 8)
- Cycle 25: (5, 7, 4, 0, 5)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (2, 5), 3>
- <1, (0, 9), 3>
- <1, (5, 7), 3>
- <1, (2, 5), 3>
- <3, (6, 8), 7>
- <4, (0, 9), 7>
- <4, (2, 5), 7>
- <7, (9, 0), 1>
- <8, (6, 3), 1>
- <8, (7, 5), 9>

Step 3: Counting the total number of unique chordal 4-cycles:
The total number of chordal 4-cycles is [10].
