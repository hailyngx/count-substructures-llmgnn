Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 6) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 17) (13, 18) (13, 5) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 0) (19, 1) (19, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 9) (7, 15) (7, 10) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1:  
Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. (1, 3, 4, 14, 1)
2. (3, 4, 12, 14, 3)
3. (18, 11, 5, 13, 18)
4. (8, 16, 15, 17, 8)
5. (11, 5, 13, 18, 11)
6. (5, 13, 18, 11, 5)
7. (16, 15, 17, 8, 16)
8. (13, 5, 11, 18, 13)
9. (15, 17, 6, 10, 15)
10. (17, 6, 10, 7, 17)
11. (6, 8, 16, 15, 6)
12. (14, 1, 3, 4, 14)

Step 2:  
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- For cycle 1: (1, 3, 4, 14, 1), chords: (3, 14)
- For cycle 2: (3, 4, 12, 14, 3), chords: (4, 14)
- For cycle 3: (18, 11, 5, 13, 18), no chords found
- For cycle 4: (8, 16, 15, 17, 8), no chords found
- For cycle 5: (11, 5, 13, 18, 11), no chords found
- For cycle 6: (5, 13, 18, 11, 5), no chords found
- For cycle 7: (16, 15, 17, 8, 16), no chords found
- For cycle 8: (13, 5, 11, 18, 13), no chords found
- For cycle 9: (15, 17, 6, 10, 15), no chords found
- For cycle 10: (17, 6, 10, 7, 17), no chords found
- For cycle 11: (6, 8, 16, 15, 6), no chords found
- For cycle 12: (14, 1, 3, 4, 14), chords: (1, 4)

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
Total number of unique chordal 4-cycles = [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:  
<1, (3, 14), 4)>  
<2, (4, 14), 3)>  
<3, 4, 12, 14, 3>  
<4, 12, 14, 3, 4>  
<5, 13, 18, 11, 5>  
<6, 5, 13, 18, 11>  
<7, 16, 15, 17, 8>  
<8, 6, 8, 16, 15>
