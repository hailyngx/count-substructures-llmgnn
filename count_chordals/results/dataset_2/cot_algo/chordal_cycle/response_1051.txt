Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 8) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 5) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 19) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 16) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 6) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (1, 3, 4, 11, 1)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (17, 3, 4, 11, 17)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (4, 9, 19, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (0, 15, 16, 1, 3, 0)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (0, 15, 16, 1, 3, 4, 9, 19, 0)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (0, 15, 10, 17, 3, 1, 16, 15)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (0, 15, 10, 17, 3, 4, 9, 19, 0)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (0, 18, 8, 12, 11, 4, 9, 19, 0)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (0, 18, 8, 12, 11, 4, 5, 14, 0)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (0, 18, 8, 13, 8, 12, 11, 4, 5, 14, 0)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (7, 0, 15, 16, 1, 3, 17, 10, 15)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (7, 0, 15, 16, 1, 3, 4, 11, 10, 15)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (7, 0, 14, 5, 4, 11, 12, 8, 18, 0)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (7, 0, 14, 5, 4, 11, 12, 8, 13, 8, 18, 0)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (15, 16, 1, 3, 4, 11, 12, 8, 18, 0, 15)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (15, 16, 1, 3, 4, 9, 19, 2, 6, 15)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (15, 16, 1, 3, 17, 10, 15, 6, 2, 19)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (5, 14, 0, 18, 8, 12, 11, 4, 9, 19, 5)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (5, 14, 0, 18, 8, 12, 11, 4, 5)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (5, 14, 0, 18, 8, 13, 8, 12, 11, 4, 9, 19, 5)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (5, 14, 0, 18, 8, 12, 11, 4, 5, 7)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (5, 14, 0, 18, 8, 13, 9, 4, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 11), 3> with chord (4, 11)
- <17, (11, 4), 3> with chord (11, 4)
- <4, (9, 19), 2, 6> with chords (9, 19) and (19, 2)
- <0, (15, 16), 1, 3> with chord (15, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [4].
