Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 5) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 23) (27, 6) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (28, 16) (28, 1) (29, 10) (29, 5) (7, 12) (7, 20) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 7) (9, 22) (9, 24) (9, 3) (9, 1) (22, 9) (22, 19) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 27) (4, 3) (4, 20) (20, 7) (20, 4) (20, 21) (20, 24) (14, 11) (14, 26) (14, 13) (26, 14) (26, 21) (6, 27) (6, 24) (6, 2) (24, 9) (24, 20) (24, 6) (24, 8) (19, 22) (19, 0) (25, 8) (18, 16) (18, 13) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 23) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 1) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 9) (1, 23) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 25) (8, 0) (21, 20) (21, 26) (13, 14) (13, 18) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (11, 3, 9, 1, 11)
- Cycle 2: (16, 28, 1, 11, 16)
- Cycle 3: (15, 27, 4, 20, 15)
- Cycle 4: (10, 17, 12, 7, 10)
- Cycle 5: (29, 5, 23, 1, 29)
- Cycle 6: (22, 19, 0, 2, 22)
- Cycle 7: (26, 14, 13, 18, 26)
- Cycle 8: (9, 3, 4, 27, 9)
- Cycle 9: (24, 6, 2, 0, 24)
- Cycle 10: (28, 1, 23, 5, 28)
- Cycle 11: (20, 4, 27, 15, 20)
- Cycle 12: (7, 12, 15, 5, 7)
- Cycle 13: (8, 3, 4, 20, 8)
- Cycle 14: (21, 26, 14, 13, 21)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (9, 3), 11> - Chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 2: <1, (16, 28), 11> - Chord: (16, 28)
- Cycle 3: <4, (20, 27), 15> - Chord: (20, 27)
- Cycle 4: <7, (12, 17), 10> - Chord: (12, 17)
- Cycle 5: <1, (23, 5), 29> - Chord: (23, 5)
- Cycle 6: <0, (19, 2), 22> - Chord: (19, 2)
- Cycle 7: <13, (14, 18), 26> - Chord: (14, 18)
- Cycle 8: <9, (27, 4), 3> - Chord: (27, 4)
- Cycle 9: <2, (6, 0), 24> - Chord: (6, 0)
- Cycle 10: <1, (23, 5), 28> - Chord: (23, 5)
- Cycle 11: <4, (27, 20), 15> - Chord: (27, 20)
- Cycle 12: <5, (15, 12), 7> - Chord: (15, 12)
- Cycle 13: <8, (4, 20), 3> - Chord: (4, 20)
- Cycle 14: <14, (13, 18), 26> - Chord: (13, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless cycles found in this graph. So, the final count is [0].
