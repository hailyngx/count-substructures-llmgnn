Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 10, 2, 8, 7, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 10, 7, 11, 14, 5, 3, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 10, 2, 9, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 13, 5, 14, 11, 2, 10, 0, 6, 3, 12, 14, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
There are no chordal cycles found in the given graph.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 4 chordless cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].

The unique chordless cycles found are:
<0, 10, 2, 8, 7, 6, 0>
<0, 10, 7, 11, 14, 5, 3, 6, 0>
<0, 10, 2, 9, 0>
<1, 4, 13, 5, 14, 11, 2, 10, 0, 6, 3, 12, 14, 1>
