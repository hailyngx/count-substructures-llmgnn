Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 11) (11, 8) (11, 2) (14, 5) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 6, 2, 1)
- Cycle 3: (3, 6, 8, 2, 3)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 10, 1, 4)
- Cycle 5: (8, 6, 7, 1, 8)
- Cycle 6: (7, 6, 3, 2, 7)
- Cycle 7: (0, 5, 14, 7, 0)
- Cycle 8: (10, 9, 6, 7, 10)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 6, 0, 4)
- Cycle 10: (2, 6, 0, 8, 2)
- Cycle 11: (12, 3, 1, 10, 12)
- Cycle 12: (13, 4, 8, 12, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, (4, 9), 6>
- <1, (3, 2), 6>
- <3, (6, 8), 2>
- <4, (9, 10), 1>
- <8, (6, 7), 1>
- <7, (6, 3), 2>
- <0, (5, 14), 7>
- <10, (9, 6), 7>
- <4, (8, 6), 0>
- <2, (6, 0), 8>
- <12, (3, 1), 10>
- <13, (4, 8), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]
