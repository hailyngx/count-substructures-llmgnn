Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 8) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 1-3-0-11-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-6-11-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-6-14-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-14-13-1
- Cycle 5: 1-5-11-6-1
- Cycle 6: 1-5-11-3-1
- Cycle 7: 1-8-0-12-1
- Cycle 8: 1-8-6-14-1
- Cycle 9: 1-8-14-13-1
- Cycle 10: 1-8-6-3-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 is chordal: <1, 3, 0, 11, 1> with chord (3, 11)
- Cycle 2 is chordal: <1, 3, 6, 11, 1> with chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 3 is chordal: <1, 3, 6, 14, 1> with chord (3, 14)
- Cycle 4 is chordal: <1, 3, 14, 13, 1> with chord (3, 14)
- Cycle 5 is chordal: <1, 5, 11, 6, 1> with chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 6 is chordal: <1, 5, 11, 3, 1> with chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 7 is chordal: <1, 8, 0, 12, 1> with chord (8, 12)
- Cycle 8 is chordal: <1, 8, 6, 14, 1> with chord (8, 14)
- Cycle 9 is chordal: <1, 8, 14, 13, 1> with chord (8, 13)
- Cycle 10 is chordal: <1, 8, 6, 3, 1> with chord (8, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so [10].
