Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 1, 9, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 1, 3, 13)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 1, 7, 8)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 9, 13, 2)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 7, 14, 10)
        - Cycle 6: (9, 1, 3, 13)
        - Cycle 7: (9, 1, 7, 8)
        - Cycle 8: (9, 4, 10, 6)
        - Cycle 9: (1, 3, 0, 9)
        - Cycle 10: (1, 7, 8, 13)
        - Cycle 11: (1, 13, 2, 12)
        - Cycle 12: (3, 1, 7, 8)
        - Cycle 13: (3, 13, 2, 12)
        - Cycle 14: (8, 13, 2, 12)
        - Cycle 15: (9, 13, 3, 10)
        - Cycle 16: (9, 13, 2, 12)
        - Cycle 17: (4, 9, 13, 2)
        - Cycle 18: (4, 10, 7, 8)
        - Cycle 19: (6, 5, 1, 7)
        - Cycle 20: (6, 4, 10, 14)
        - Cycle 21: (12, 4, 10, 14)
        - Cycle 22: (12, 2, 13, 9)
        - Cycle 23: (12, 2, 11, 14)
        - Cycle 24: (2, 13, 9, 4)
        - Cycle 25: (2, 11, 14, 7)
        - Cycle 26: (11, 12, 2, 13)
        - Cycle 27: (11, 14, 7, 10)
        - Cycle 28: (14, 12, 2, 13)
        - Cycle 29: (14, 7, 10, 4)
        - Cycle 30: (10, 3, 1, 7)

Step 2: Identify chordal 4-cycles:
        - Chordal Cycle 1: <1, (5, 9), 4)>  
        - Chordal Cycle 2: <2, (13, 9), 4)>
        - Chordal Cycle 3: <3, (13, 1), 2)>
        - Chordal Cycle 4: <4, (7, 14), 10)>
        - Chordal Cycle 5: <5, (1, 7), 8)>
        - Chordal Cycle 6: <6, (2, 13), 9)>
        - Chordal Cycle 7: <7, (10, 4), 14)>
        - Chordal Cycle 8: <8, (7, 1), 5)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
        There are 8 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [8].
