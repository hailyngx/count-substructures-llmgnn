Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 0-4-1-5-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-1-7-4-0
- Cycle 3: 5-1-7-4-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-3-9-6-5
- Cycle 5: 5-1-2-9-6-5
- Cycle 6: 3-9-2-8-0-3
- Cycle 7: 9-6-4-7-9
- Cycle 8: 9-6-5-1-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (4, 1)
- Cycle 2 has 2 chords: (1, 7)
- Cycle 3 has 2 chords: (1, 4)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (6, 4)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (6, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
