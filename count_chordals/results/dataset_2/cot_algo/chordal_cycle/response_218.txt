Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 14) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: (0, 10, 5, 8, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 10, 5, 8, 1, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 10, 5, 8, 2, 7, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 10, 4, 6, 13, 2, 7, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 10, 7, 2, 13, 6, 4, 0)
- Cycle 6: (1, 8, 0, 10, 5, 8, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 8, 0, 10, 7, 2, 13, 12, 11, 1)
- Cycle 8: (2, 7, 0, 10, 5, 8, 2)
- Cycle 9: (3, 9, 10, 0, 4, 6, 13, 3)
- Cycle 10: (4, 6, 13, 2, 7, 0, 10, 4)
- Cycle 11: (7, 0, 10, 5, 8, 2, 7)
- Cycle 12: (10, 0, 8, 1, 7, 2, 13, 6, 10)
- Cycle 13: (11, 0, 8, 5, 10, 4, 6, 13, 12, 11)
- Cycle 14: (12, 2, 13, 6, 4, 10, 0, 7, 12)
- Cycle 15: (13, 6, 4, 10, 0, 7, 2, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (0, 8), 5, 10> has 1 chord (0, 8)
- <2, (7, 13), 6, 10> has 1 chord (7, 13)
- <3, (9, 13), 4, 6> has 1 chord (9, 13)
- <4, (0, 2), 7, 10> has 1 chord (0, 2)
- <5, (0, 13), 4, 7> has 1 chord (0, 13)
- <6, (5, 10), 2, 8> has 1 chord (5, 10)
- <7, (8, 10), 0, 1> has 1 chord (8, 10)
- <8, (10, 13), 2, 7> has 1 chord (10, 13)
- <9, (9, 10), 0, 4> has 1 chord (9, 10)
- <10, (2, 13), 6, 7> has 1 chord (2, 13)
- <11, (0, 10), 2, 7> has 1 chord (0, 10)
- <12, (5, 8), 2, 7> has 1 chord (5, 8)
- <13, (6, 13), 4, 10> has 1 chord (6, 13)
- <14, (3, 13), 6, 4> has 1 chord (3, 13)
- <15, (4, 10), 0, 7> has 1 chord (4, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [15]
