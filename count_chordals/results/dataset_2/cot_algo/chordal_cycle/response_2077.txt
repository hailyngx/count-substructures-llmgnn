Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 5) (16, 1) (16, 9) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 3) (18, 13) (5, 11) (5, 6) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 15) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 19) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 17) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 10) (12, 2) (12, 17) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 14) (15, 8) (15, 13) (9, 11) (9, 16) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 13) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:  
- Cycle 1: <11, 3, 2, 18, 6, 5>
- Cycle 2: <11, 3, 19, 17, 12, 2>
- Cycle 3: <11, 0, 17, 12, 2, 3>
- Cycle 4: <16, 1, 6, 18, 2, 12>
- Cycle 5: <16, 1, 4, 8, 15, 13>
- Cycle 6: <2, 14, 7, 6, 18, 3>
- Cycle 7: <18, 13, 15, 8, 4, 1>
- Cycle 8: <5, 6, 14, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 9: <6, 1, 16, 9, 11, 5>
- Cycle 10: <6, 1, 10, 13, 18, 2>
- Cycle 11: <6, 5, 11, 0, 17, 19>
- Cycle 12: <1, 4, 8, 19, 17, 12>
- Cycle 13: <15, 8, 4, 1, 10, 13>
- Cycle 14: <17, 0, 13, 10, 1, 16>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <11, 3, 2, 18, 6, 5> has chord (3, 18)
- <11, 3, 19, 17, 12, 2> has chord (3, 12)
- <16, 1, 4, 8, 15, 13> has chord (1, 8)
- <2, 14, 7, 6, 18, 3> has chord (14, 6)
- <5, 6, 14, 7, 6, 5> has chord (6, 14)
- <6, 5, 11, 0, 17, 19> has chord (11, 0)
- <1, 4, 8, 19, 17, 12> has chord (4, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final count is [7].
