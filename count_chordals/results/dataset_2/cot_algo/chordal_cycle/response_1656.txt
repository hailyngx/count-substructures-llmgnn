Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 10) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 2) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 4 - 14 - 13 - 4
        - Cycle 2: 3 - 14 - 13 - 3
        - Cycle 3: 11 - 13 - 10 - 11
        - Cycle 4: 12 - 10 - 13 - 12
        - Cycle 5: 0 - 6 - 1 - 0
        - Cycle 6: 7 - 4 - 6 - 7
        - Cycle 7: 9 - 2 - 11 - 9
        - Cycle 8: 8 - 0 - 6 - 8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Only Cycle 6: 7 - 6 - 4 - 7 has exactly one chord 4-6

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - Number of chordal 4-cycles = [0]

Thus, in this graph, there are no chordal 4-cycles.
