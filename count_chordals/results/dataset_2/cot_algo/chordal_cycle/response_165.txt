Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- (0, 1, 7, 5, 4, 0)
- (1, 2, 5, 7, 3, 1)
- (1, 2, 6, 8, 3, 1)
- (2, 5, 4, 3, 9, 2)
- (3, 4, 0, 9, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Checking (0, 1, 7, 5, 4, 0): Chord (4, 5) found.
- Checking (1, 2, 5, 7, 3, 1): Chord (1, 7) found.
- Checking (1, 2, 6, 8, 3, 1): No chord found. This is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There was 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Final count: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (6, 8), 3>
