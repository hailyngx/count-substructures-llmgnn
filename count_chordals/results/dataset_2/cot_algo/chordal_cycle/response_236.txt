Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 12) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 3) (18, 16) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 16) (5, 7) (5, 3) (19, 17) (19, 9) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (15, 12) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 9) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 9) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (11, 15) (11, 13) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (13, 14) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (14, 12, 15, 10, 14)
- Cycle 2: (14, 12, 1, 4, 9, 14)
- Cycle 3: (14, 10, 15, 12, 1, 4, 9, 14)
- Cycle 4: (17, 6, 8, 1, 12, 15, 10, 14, 9, 4, 16, 18, 17)
- Cycle 5: (17, 6, 8, 3, 2, 5, 7, 17)
- Cycle 6: (2, 3, 8, 6, 7, 5, 3)
- Cycle 7: (18, 16, 15, 12, 1, 4, 9, 19, 17, 6, 8, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: No chord
- Cycle 2: Chord: (1, 9) -> <1, (1, 9), 4>
- Cycle 3: Chord: (15, 14) -> <2, (15, 14), 10>
- Cycle 4: Chord: (12, 9) -> <3, (12, 9), 16>
- Cycle 5: Chord: (6, 3) -> <4, (6, 3), 8>
- Cycle 6: No chord
- Cycle 7: Chord: (16, 4) -> <5, (16, 4), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (1, 9), 4>
<2, (15, 14), 10>
<3, (12, 9), 16>
