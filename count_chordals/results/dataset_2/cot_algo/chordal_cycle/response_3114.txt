Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 10) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 19) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 9) (17, 14) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 18) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 19) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 6) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 4) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 18) (6, 15) (6, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-7-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-10-16-15-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-10-16-19-9-14-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-10-16-19-4-11-1
- Cycle 5: 1-4-11-16-15-1
- Cycle 6: 1-4-19-16-15-1
- Cycle 7: 1-7-14-9-5-2-8-1
- Cycle 8: 1-7-14-17-9-5-13-1
- Cycle 9: 1-7-3-10-16-15-1
- Cycle 10: 1-7-3-10-12-15-1
- Cycle 11: 1-7-3-10-16-19-9-5-13-1
- Cycle 12: 1-0-1

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, 7>
- Cycle 2: no chord
- Cycle 3: no chord
- Cycle 4: <3, 10>
- Cycle 5: no chord
- Cycle 6: <4, 19>
- Cycle 7: <7, 14>
- Cycle 8: no chord
- Cycle 9: <3, 10>
- Cycle 10: <3, 10>
- Cycle 11: <7, 14>
- Cycle 12: <0, 1>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 7, 14, 9>
<3, 10, 16, 15>
<4, 19, 16, 15>
<7, 14, 17, 9>
<0, 1, 3, 7>
