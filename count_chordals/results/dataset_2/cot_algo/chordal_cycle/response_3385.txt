Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 1) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 2) (3, 25) (3, 27) (25, 13) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 9) (23, 22) (23, 29) (23, 19) (2, 22) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 24) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 20) (19, 23) (19, 29) (19, 14) (19, 27) (26, 20) (26, 6) (9, 22) (9, 25) (9, 20) (11, 28) (11, 29) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 27) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 4) (21, 6) (21, 5) (7, 25) (10, 12) (10, 20) (15, 17) (4, 6) (4, 27) (4, 1) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 28) (27, 4) (27, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 24) (12, 28) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 0) (16, 27) (16, 24) (17, 28) (17, 15) (17, 12) (24, 18) (24, 1) (24, 16) (14, 19) (14, 5) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 26) (20, 9) (20, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 5) (29, 23) (29, 19) (29, 11) (5, 21) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (13, 22, 2, 18, 24, 1, 13)
- Cycle 2: (13, 25, 3, 27, 4, 1, 13)
- Cycle 3: (13, 25, 9, 22, 2, 18, 24, 1, 13)
- Cycle 4: (22, 13, 25, 3, 27, 4, 27, 28, 17, 15, 17, 12, 0, 12, 28, 27, 23, 19, 29, 11, 28, 8, 2, 22)
- Cycle 5: (22, 2, 18, 24, 1, 13, 25, 9, 22)
- Cycle 6: (22, 23, 29, 19, 27, 4, 1, 24, 16, 27, 28, 17, 15, 17, 12, 0, 5, 21, 6, 26, 20, 9, 25, 3, 22)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (2, 18) -> <1, (2, 18), 13>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (25, 3) -> <2, (25, 3), 13>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (25, 9) -> <3, (25, 9), 13>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (27, 23) -> <4, (27, 23), 22>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (1, 25) -> <5, (1, 25), 22>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (27, 4) -> <6, (27, 4), 22>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph. Therefore, the final count is [0].
