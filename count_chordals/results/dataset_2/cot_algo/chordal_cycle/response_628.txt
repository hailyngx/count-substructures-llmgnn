- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (5, 7), 4, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (5, 7), 6, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (5, 3), 4, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (3, 5), 7, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (3, 4), 7, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <2, (4, 1), 5, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <2, (4, 1), 6, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <2, (4, 3), 1, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <4, (3, 5), 7, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <4, (3, 1), 6, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <6, (1, 3), 4, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <6, (1, 4), 7, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <6, (1, 5), 9, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <6, (7, 5), 9, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <6, (7, 4), 3, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <6, (7, 5), 1, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <6, (8, 9), 0, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <6, (8, 2), 4, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <6, (8, 0), 9, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 21: <9, (5, 7), 4, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 22: <9, (5, 1), 6, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 23: <9, (0, 4), 3, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 24: <9, (0, 6), 7, 9>
