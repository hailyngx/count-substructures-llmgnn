Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 18) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 19) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 7) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 10) (16, 5) (16, 0) (7, 17) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (12, 13) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 19) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 2) (14, 5) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 19) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 14) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-3-18-15-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-19-11-6-1
- Cycle 3: 1-10-0-16-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-10-2-17-7-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 has no chords
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has chord (0, 16)
- Cycle 4 has chord (2, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
  
  There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
  
  <1, 3, 18, 15, (6, 11)>
  <1, 10, 0, 16, (5, 3)>
