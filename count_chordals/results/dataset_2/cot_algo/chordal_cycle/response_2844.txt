This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 16) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 8) (17, 1) (15, 19) (15, 2) (15, 16) (3, 6) (3, 18) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 16) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (18, 3) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (0, 5, 6, 4, 0)
- (0, 5, 9, 4, 0)
- (0, 14, 6, 5, 0)
- (0, 14, 16, 15, 19, 0)
- (1, 9, 4, 1)
- (1, 9, 5, 0, 14, 1)
- (1, 4, 6, 11, 1)
- (1, 4, 9, 5, 0, 1)
- (1, 12, 8, 11, 1)
- (1, 12, 1)
- (1, 13, 7, 19, 0, 14, 1)
- (1, 13, 1)
- (1, 17, 8, 11, 6, 4, 1)
- (1, 17, 8, 12, 1)
- (2, 15, 14, 2)
- (2, 15, 16, 14, 2)
- (3, 6, 4, 9, 1, 13, 3)
- (3, 6, 11, 8, 12, 1, 13, 3)
- (3, 18, 3)
- (4, 6, 5, 9, 4)
- (4, 6, 11, 8, 12, 4)
- (4, 9, 5, 6, 4)
- (5, 6, 4, 9, 5)
- (6, 11, 8, 12, 6)
- (6, 14, 16, 15, 19, 0, 5, 6)
- (8, 11, 6, 4, 9, 1, 13, 8)
- (8, 11, 6, 5, 9, 4, 1, 13, 8)
- (8, 12, 11, 6, 5, 9, 4, 1, 13, 8)
- (10, 11, 8, 12, 1, 13, 10)
- (10, 1, 13, 7, 19, 0, 14, 16, 15, 10)
- (10, 0, 19, 15, 16, 14, 2, 10)
- (12, 8, 11, 6, 4, 9, 1, 13, 12)
- (12, 8, 11, 6, 5, 9, 4, 1, 13, 12)
- (13, 1, 9, 4, 6, 5, 0, 14, 13)
- (14, 6, 5, 0, 19, 15, 16, 14)
- (15, 14, 6, 5, 9, 4, 1, 13, 15)
- (16, 14, 6, 5, 0, 19, 15, 16)
- (17, 1, 13, 7, 19, 0, 14, 6, 11, 8, 17)
- (19, 7, 13, 1, 9, 5, 6, 4, 0, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, (5, 9), 4, 6>
- <0, (14, 16), 15, 19>
- <1, (9, 4), 6, 11>
- <1, (13, 7), 19, 0>
- <1, (17, 8), 12, 11>
- <2, (15, 16), 14, 2>
- <3, (6, 4), 9, 1, 13>
- <3, (18), 3>
- <5, (6, 4), 9, 1>
- <8, (11, 6), 5, 9, 4>
- <10, (1, 13), 7, 19>
- <10, (0, 19), 15, 16, 14>
- <12, (8, 11), 6, 5, 9, 4>
- <13, (1, 9), 5, 0, 14>
- <14, (6, 5), 0, 19, 15, 16>
- <15, (14, 6), 5, 9, 4, 1, 13>
- <16, (14, 6), 5, 0, 19, 15>
- <17, (1, 13), 7, 19, 0, 14>
- <19, (7, 13), 1, 9, 5, 6, 4, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are [18] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
