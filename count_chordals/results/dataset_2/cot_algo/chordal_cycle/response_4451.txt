This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 18) (22, 4) (22, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 10) (9, 16) (9, 7) (3, 22) (3, 15) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 25) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 11) (21, 25) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 2) (6, 16) (26, 1) (26, 14) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 20) (17, 1) (17, 8) (17, 11) (20, 18) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 25) (12, 4) (12, 28) (2, 6) (2, 11) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 8) (24, 14) (24, 16) (24, 27) (24, 29) (7, 9) (7, 29) (7, 10) (29, 24) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 25) (23, 4) (23, 28) (23, 27) (28, 12) (28, 23) (27, 24) (27, 23) (27, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (19, 1) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 14) (25, 29) (0, 4) (0, 29) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 17) (11, 2) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 16) (8, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (1, 21, 6, 5, 16, 9, 7)
- Cycle 2: (1, 21, 11, 5, 16, 9, 7)
- Cycle 3: (1, 21, 25, 15, 3, 22, 4)
- Cycle 4: (1, 21, 25, 29, 24, 16, 5)
- Cycle 5: (1, 17, 8, 15, 25, 14, 26)
- Cycle 6: (1, 17, 8, 27, 24, 29, 0)
- Cycle 7: (1, 19, 21, 6, 2, 11, 17)
- Cycle 8: (21, 25, 15, 3, 22, 4, 18)
- Cycle 9: (21, 25, 14, 26, 1, 17, 11)
- Cycle 10: (21, 25, 29, 24, 16, 5, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 5, 16, 9, 7, 29, 24)
- Cycle 12: (6, 5, 16, 24, 29, 0, 4)
- Cycle 13: (6, 21, 25, 15, 3, 18, 13)
- Cycle 14: (6, 21, 11, 17, 8, 27, 23)
- Cycle 15: (6, 2, 11, 17, 1, 26, 14)
- Cycle 16: (11, 5, 16, 9, 7, 29, 24)
- Cycle 17: (11, 5, 16, 24, 29, 0, 4)
- Cycle 18: (11, 21, 25, 15, 3, 18, 4)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 21, 25, 15, (3, 22), 4>
- <1, 21, 25, 29, (24, 16), 5>
- <1, 17, 8, (15, 25), 14, 26>
- <1, 19, 21, 6, (2, 11), 17>
- <6, 21, 25, 15, (3, 18), 13>
- <6, 21, 11, (17, 8), 27, 23>
- <6, 2, 11, (17, 1), 26, 14>
- <11, 21, 25, 15, (3, 18), 4>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [8].
