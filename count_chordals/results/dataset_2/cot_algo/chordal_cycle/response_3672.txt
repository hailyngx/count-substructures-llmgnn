Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (7, 0, 1, 9)  
- Cycle 2: (7, 0, 6, 3)  
- Cycle 3: (7, 2, 1, 9)  
- Cycle 4: (7, 2, 3, 9)  
- Cycle 5: (1, 9, 8, 4)  
- Cycle 6: (1, 9, 3, 6)  
- Cycle 7: (1, 7, 0, 5)  
- Cycle 8: (1, 0, 6, 3)  
- Cycle 9: (3, 9, 8, 4)  
- Cycle 10: (3, 9, 1, 7)  
- Cycle 11: (3, 6, 7, 1)  
- Cycle 12: (8, 9, 1, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <7, (0, 1), 9>  
- <7, (0, 6), 3>
- <7, (2, 1), 9>
- <7, (2, 3), 9>
- <1, (9, 8), 4>
- <1, (9, 3), 6>
- <1, (7, 0), 5>
- <3, (9, 8), 4>
- <3, (9, 1), 7>
- <8, (9, 1), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
As there are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [10].
