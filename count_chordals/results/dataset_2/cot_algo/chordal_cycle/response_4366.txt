Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 3) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-9-1-8
- Cycle 2: 4-9-0-7
- Cycle 3: 4-6-0-7
- Cycle 4: 4-5-8-1
- Cycle 5: 0-7-6-4
- Cycle 6: 0-7-9-4
- Cycle 7: 0-6-4-5
- Cycle 8: 8-5-4-2
- Cycle 9: 8-5-3-0
- Cycle 10: 8-1-9-7
- Cycle 11: 1-9-7-0
- Cycle 12: 1-9-4-6
- Cycle 13: 6-4-2-3
- Cycle 14: 3-2-1-8
- Cycle 15: 3-2-4-6
- Cycle 16: 3-5-8-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, (9, 1), 8> (Cycle 1)
- <4, (9, 0), 7> (Cycle 2)
- <4, (6, 7), 0> (Cycle 3)
- <4, (5, 8), 1> (Cycle 4)
- <0, (7, 6), 4> (Cycle 5)
- <0, (7, 9), 4> (Cycle 6)
- <0, (6, 4), 5> (Cycle 7)
- <8, (5, 4), 2> (Cycle 8)
- <8, (5, 3), 0> (Cycle 9)
- <8, (1, 9), 7> (Cycle 10)
- <1, (9, 7), 0> (Cycle 11)
- <1, (9, 4), 6> (Cycle 12)
- <6, (4, 2), 3> (Cycle 13)
- <3, (2, 1), 8> (Cycle 14)
- <3, (2, 4), 6> (Cycle 15)
- <3, (5, 8), 1> (Cycle 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
