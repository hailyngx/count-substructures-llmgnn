Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 29) (3, 26) (20, 1) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 19) (25, 17) (25, 18) (25, 24) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 0) (27, 12) (27, 11) (27, 9) (27, 13) (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 2) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 4) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 7) (19, 20) (19, 18) (26, 3) (26, 20) (26, 18) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 7) (28, 29) (28, 5) (28, 13) (18, 25) (18, 19) (18, 26) (2, 15) (2, 13) (22, 5) (22, 11) (16, 23) (11, 27) (11, 22) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (9, 27) (7, 1) (7, 29) (7, 5) (7, 10) (24, 25) (24, 0) (24, 10) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 24) (0, 8) (0, 13) (23, 16) (23, 4) (23, 10) (4, 17) (4, 14) (4, 23) (13, 27) (13, 15) (13, 28) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 7) (10, 24) (10, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-21-12-27-11-14-3-1
- Cycle 2: 1-21-12-0-24-25-17-12-1
- Cycle 3: 1-21-12-17-25-18-19-20-1
- Cycle 4: 3-29-28-13-27-12-17-3
- Cycle 5: 7-1-21-12-27-13-28-5-7
- Cycle 6: 7-29-3-1-7
- Cycle 7: 10-7-29-28-13-0-24-10

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 1-21-12-27-11-14-3-1 has one chord {12, 3}
- Cycle 2: 1-21-12-0-24-25-17-12-1 has one chord {12, 17}
- Cycle 3: 1-21-12-17-25-18-19-20-1 has one chord {12, 18}
- Cycle 4: 3-29-28-13-27-12-17-3 has one chord {13, 17}
- Cycle 5: 7-1-21-12-27-13-28-5-7 has one chord {1, 28}
- Cycle 6: 7-29-3-1-7 has one chord {29, 1}
- Cycle 7: 10-7-29-28-13-0-24-10 has one chord {7, 0}

Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (12, 3), 21>
- <1, (12, 17), 21>
- <1, (12, 18), 21>
- <3, (13, 17), 29>
- <7, (1, 28), 29>
- <7, (29, 1), 3>
- <10, (7, 0), 24>
