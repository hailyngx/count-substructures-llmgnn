Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<5, 9, 6, 2, 5>
<5, 9, 3, 7, 6, 5>
<9, 4, 7, 3, 9>
<4, 7, 6, 9, 4>
<7, 3, 0, 8, 7>
<3, 0, 8, 6, 2, 3>
<6, 8, 0, 9, 6>
<8, 2, 0, 9, 8>
<2, 5, 8, 0, 2>
<5, 1, 9, 6, 5>
<9, 0, 4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 5, 1, 4>
<7, 6, 8, 5, 7>
<3, 9, 0, 8, 3>
<6, 7, 4, 9, 6>
<8, 5, 1, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 7, 3, 2>
<0, 9, 5, 1, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

<5, 9, 3, 7, 6, 5> has a chord: (3, 6)
<9, 4, 7, 3, 9> has a chord: (4, 3)
<4, 7, 6, 9, 4> has a chord: (7, 9)
<7, 3, 0, 8, 7> has a chord: (3, 8)
<3, 0, 8, 6, 2, 3> has a chord: (0, 6)
<6, 8, 0, 9, 6> has a chord: (8, 9)
<8, 2, 0, 9, 8> has a chord: (2, 9)
<2, 5, 8, 0, 2> has a chord: (5, 8)
<5, 1, 9, 6, 5> has a chord: (1, 6>
<9, 0, 4, 7, 9> has a chord: (0, 7)
<4, 8, 5, 1, 4> has a chord: (8, 1)
<7, 6, 8, 5, 7> has a chord: (6, 5)
<3, 9, 0, 8, 3> has a chord: (9, 8)
<6, 7, 4, 9, 6> has a chord: (7, 4)
<8, 5, 1, 4, 8> has a chord: (5, 4)
<2, 6, 7, 3, 2> has a chord: (6, 3)
<0, 9, 5, 1, 0> has a chord: (9, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 17 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [17].
