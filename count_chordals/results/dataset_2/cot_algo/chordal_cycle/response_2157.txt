Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 6, 3, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 7, 6, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 6, 5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 5, 6, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 5, 7, 6, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 6, 5, 7, 3)
- Cycle 7: (5, 1, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 3, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 10: (6, 3, 5, 7, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 5, 7, 6)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (3, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles = 8
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycle in the graph is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (5, 3), 6, 3>
<3, (1, 6), 5, 1>
<5, (1, 5), 6, 3>
<6, (3, 7), 5, 1>
