Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<1, 3, 5, 13>
<1, 3, 9, 4>
<1, 4, 12, 13>
<1, 4, 12, 9>
<1, 4, 8, 10>
<1, 4, 8, 0>
<1, 13, 12, 9>
<1, 13, 12, 4>
<1, 14, 11, 0>
<1, 14, 11, 9>
<3, 5, 0, 8>
<3, 5, 13, 12>
<3, 5, 13, 10>
<3, 6, 0, 8>
<3, 6, 8, 10>
<3, 6, 7, 2>
<3, 7, 2, 0>
<4, 10, 13, 12>
<4, 10, 13, 1>
<4, 12, 9, 11>
<4, 12, 13, 10>
<4, 8, 0, 11>
<4, 8, 6, 0>
<5, 14, 11, 0>
<5, 14, 1, 13>
<6, 0, 11, 9>
<7, 3, 6, 8>
<9, 11, 14, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<1, 3, 5, 13> (chord: (3, 5))
<1, 3, 9, 4> (chord: (3, 9))
<1, 4, 12, 13> (chord: (4, 12))
<1, 4, 12, 9> (chord: (4, 12))
<1, 4, 8, 10> (chord: (4, 8))
<1, 4, 8, 0> (chord: (4, 8))
<1, 13, 12, 9> (chord: (13, 12))
<1, 13, 12, 4> (chord: (13, 12))
<1, 14, 11, 0> (chord: (14, 11))
<1, 14, 11, 9> (chord: (14, 11))
<3, 5, 0, 8> (chord: (0, 8))
<3, 5, 13, 12> (chord: (5, 13))
<3, 5, 13, 10> (chord: (5, 13))
<3, 6, 0, 8> (chord: (0, 8))
<3, 6, 8, 10> (chord: (6, 8))
<3, 6, 7, 2> (chord: (6, 7))
<3, 7, 2, 0> (chord: (7, 2))
<4, 10, 13, 12> (chord: (10, 13))
<4, 10, 13, 1> (chord: (10, 13))
<4, 12, 9, 11> (chord: (12, 9))
<4, 12, 13, 10> (chord: (12, 13))
<4, 8, 0, 11> (chord: (8, 0))
<4, 8, 6, 0> (chord: (8, 6))
<5, 14, 11, 0> (chord: (14, 11))
<5, 14, 1, 13> (chord: (14, 1))
<6, 0, 11, 9> (chord: (0, 11))
<7, 3, 6, 8> (chord: (3, 6))
<9, 11, 14, 10> (chord: (11, 14))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [27]
