Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 11) (4, 18) (7, 23) (7, 13) (7, 8) (3, 20) (25, 20) (25, 21) (20, 3) (20, 25) (20, 24) (20, 6) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 29) (22, 1) (23, 7) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 12) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 11) (29, 22) (29, 14) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 10) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 18) (0, 11) (14, 29) (14, 27) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 16) (13, 26) (13, 7) (13, 12) (24, 20) (24, 23) (24, 2) (24, 17) (16, 18) (16, 17) (16, 27) (28, 19) (10, 26) (10, 5) (10, 21) (10, 8) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 15) (12, 23) (12, 13) (12, 8) (1, 22) (1, 11) (1, 8) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 28) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 27) (17, 24) (17, 16) (17, 19) (15, 23) (15, 5) (15, 21) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (27, 14) (27, 16) (27, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (26, 13, 7, 23, 22, 2, 11, 0, 26)
- Cycle 2: (26, 10, 21, 25, 20, 6, 5, 2, 24, 17, 16, 18, 4, 26)
- Cycle 3: (26, 10, 8, 1, 22, 23, 12, 13, 26)
- Cycle 4: (22, 23, 12, 8, 1, 11, 19, 27, 16, 17, 24, 20, 25, 21, 15, 23)
- Cycle 5: (22, 2, 24, 20, 25, 21, 15, 5, 6, 20)
- Cycle 6: (22, 29, 14, 27, 16, 18, 6, 5, 15, 21, 10, 26)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (0, 11), 26>
- <2, (5, 24), 22>
- <3, (6, 20), 5>
- <4, (22, 23), 12>
- <5, (2, 15), 21>
- <6, (10, 18), 26>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
