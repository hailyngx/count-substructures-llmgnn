Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 3) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 18) (8, 4) (8, 5) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 16) (11, 9) (11, 14) (0, 19) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 17) (1, 18) (1, 5) (1, 19) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 12) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 5) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 3) (16, 19) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 12) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 2-5-8-4-2
- Cycle 2: 2-5-15-14-2
- Cycle 3: 2-5-12-13-2
- Cycle 4: 7-17-13-12-7
- Cycle 5: 7-17-16-19-1-18-8-4-3-10-7
- Cycle 6: 7-17-16-19-1-5-8-4-3-10-7
- Cycle 7: 7-17-13-12-5-1-19-16-3-4-8-7

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: <2, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle 2: <2, 5, 15, 14>
- Cycle 3: <2, 5, 12, 13>
- Cycle 4: <7, 17, 13, 12>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<2, 4, 8, 5>
<2, 5, 15, 14>
<2, 5, 12, 13>
<7, 17, 13, 12>
