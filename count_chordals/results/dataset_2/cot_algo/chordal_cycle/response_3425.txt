Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 14) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

        - Cycle 1: (4, 7, 5, 2, 4)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 10, 6, 11, 9, 1, 4)
        - Cycle 3: (4, 10, 13, 1, 9, 11, 3, 6, 10)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 13, 14, 8, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 13, 5, 7, 8, 14, 13)
        - Cycle 6: (4, 1, 9, 11, 3, 14, 13, 5, 2, 4)
        - Cycle 7: (4, 1, 13, 14, 8, 7, 5, 2, 5, 13)
        - Cycle 8: (4, 1, 13, 14, 5, 7, 8, 14, 3, 11, 6, 10, 0, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

        - Cycle 1: (4, 7, 5, 2, 4) has chord (5, 2)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 10, 6, 11, 9, 1, 4) has chord (6, 9)
        - Cycle 3: (4, 10, 13, 1, 9, 11, 3, 6, 10) has chord (1, 6)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 13, 14, 8, 7, 4) has chord (14, 7)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 13, 5, 7, 8, 14, 13) has chord (5, 8)
        - Cycle 6: (4, 1, 9, 11, 3, 14, 13, 5, 2, 4) has chord (9, 2)
        - Cycle 7: (4, 1, 13, 14, 8, 7, 5, 2, 5, 13) has chord (1, 7)
        - Cycle 8: (4, 1, 13, 14, 5, 7, 8, 14, 3, 11, 6, 10, 0, 4) has chord (1, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

        Therefore, we have [0] unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph.
