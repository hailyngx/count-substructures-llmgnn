Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 1, 6, 5)
- (5, 6, 7, 5)
- (5, 0, 2, 8, 5)
- (9, 5, 1, 6, 9)
- (9, 7, 6, 5, 9)
- (9, 8, 2, 0, 9)
- (4, 7, 9, 8, 4)
- (7, 3, 0, 6, 7)
- (1, 3, 0, 5, 1)
- (8, 3, 0, 7, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <5, (1, 6), 9>
2. <5, (0, 2), 8>
3. <9, (1, 6), 5>
4. <9, (7, 6), 5>
5. <9, (8, 2), 0>
6. <4, (7, 9), 8>
7. <7, (3, 0), 6>
8. <1, (3, 0), 5>
9. <8, (3, 0), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles.

There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
