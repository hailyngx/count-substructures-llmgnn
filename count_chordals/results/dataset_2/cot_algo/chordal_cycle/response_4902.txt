Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 6 - 2 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 5 - 9 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 3: 1 - 5 - 9 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 5 - 6 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 5: 2 - 6 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 6: 3 - 0 - 7 - 4 - 3
- Cycle 7: 4 - 5 - 9 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 8: 4 - 7 - 2 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 9: 5 - 9 - 7 - 6 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has chord (2, 6)
- Cycle 2 has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 3 has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 4 has chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 6 has chord (0, 7)
- Cycle 7 has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 8 has chord (2, 6)
- Cycle 9 has chord (5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, (5, 9)>, <1, (5, 6)>, <2, (5, 9)>, <3, (5, 9)>.
