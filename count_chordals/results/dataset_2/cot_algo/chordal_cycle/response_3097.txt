Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 2, 7, 4> (Chords: (0, 7))
- Cycle <0, 3, 9, 6> (Chords: (0, 9))
- Cycle <0, 3, 4, 1> (Chords: (0, 4))
- Cycle <0, 1, 6, 9> (Chords: (0, 6))

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle <0, 2, 7, 4>: One chord found (0, 7)
- Cycle <0, 3, 9, 6>: One chord found (0, 9)
- Cycle <0, 3, 4, 1>: One chord found (0, 4)
- Cycle <0, 1, 6, 9>: One chord found (0, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
