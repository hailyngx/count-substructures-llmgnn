Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 8, 14, 1, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 4, 12, 11, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 4, 5, 7, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 9, 4, 1, 14, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 9, 4, 2, 0, 6)
- Cycle 6: (9, 4, 12, 11, 6, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 4, 5, 7, 6, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 4, 1, 14, 6, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 4, 2, 0, 6, 9)
- Cycle 10: (4, 12, 11, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 5, 7, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 1, 14, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 2, 0, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 14: (8, 14, 1, 6, 9, 8)
- Cycle 15: (7, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7)
- Cycle 16: (12, 11, 6, 9, 8, 12)
- Cycle 17: (11, 12, 4, 9, 8, 11)
- Cycle 18: (14, 1, 6, 9, 8, 14)
- Cycle 19: (7, 5, 4, 9, 12, 7)
- Cycle 20: (5, 7, 6, 9, 12, 5)
- Cycle 21: (5, 4, 9, 8, 14, 5)
- Cycle 22: (13, 0, 2, 4, 9, 13)
- Cycle 23: (3, 8, 9, 4, 5, 3)
- Cycle 24: (10, 6, 9, 8, 14, 10)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (8, 14), 6>
- Cycle 2: no chord
- Cycle 3: no chord
- Cycle 4: no chord
- Cycle 5: <0, (2, 4), 6>
- Cycle 6: no chord
- Cycle 7: no chord
- Cycle 8: no chord
- Cycle 9: no chord
- Cycle 10: <6, (4, 9), 9>
- Cycle 11: no chord
- Cycle 12: no chord
- Cycle 13: no chord
- Cycle 14: <8, (1, 9), 14>
- Cycle 15: <7, (4, 8), 5>
- Cycle 16: <11, (6, 8), 12>
- Cycle 17: no chord
- Cycle 18: <6, (9, 2), 14>
- Cycle 19: no chord
- Cycle 20: <7, (5, 9), 6>
- Cycle 21: <4, (5, 14), 9>
- Cycle 22: <9, (0, 4), 13>
- Cycle 23: <4, (5, 9), 8>
- Cycle 24: <8, (6, 9), 14>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [15-9 = 6].
