Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 0, 3, 7, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 1, 2, 7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 5, 4) or (5, 4, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 4: (7, 2, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 3, 1, 8, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 4, 6, 8, 7)
- Cycle 7: (1, 4, 6, 8, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 4, 0, 9, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 3, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 3, 0, 9, 1)
- Cycle 11: (3, 7, 2, 8, 3)
- Cycle 12: (3, 7, 6, 8, 3)
- Cycle 13: (3, 1, 4, 5, 3)
- Cycle 14: (5, 4, 0, 9, 5)
- Cycle 15: (6, 4, 0, 3, 6)
- Cycle 16: (6, 4, 1, 8, 6)
- Cycle 17: (6, 7, 3, 0, 6)
- Cycle 18: (2, 7, 4, 5, 2)
- Cycle 19: (2, 1, 3, 9, 2)
- Cycle 20: (2, 1, 4, 6, 2)
- Cycle 21: (8, 7, 2, 9, 8)
- Cycle 22: (8, 7, 6, 4, 8)
- Cycle 23: (8, 1, 3, 7, 8)
- Cycle 24: (8, 6, 4, 1, 8)
- Cycle 25: (9, 1, 4, 5, 9)
- Cycle 26: (9, 3, 7, 6, 9)
- Cycle 27: (9, 0, 4, 5, 9)
- Cycle 28: (0, 4, 1, 8, 0)
- Cycle 29: (0, 3, 7, 2, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 7), 2, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, (1, 4), 8, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (0, 5), 6, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (0, 5), 4, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (1, 8), 4, 3)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 24 chordless cycles found.

Putting it all together, the final answer is [24].
