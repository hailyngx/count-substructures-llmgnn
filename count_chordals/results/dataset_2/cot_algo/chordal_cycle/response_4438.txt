Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

There are several cycles in the graph, but we are interested in cycles of length 4 or more. Let's list them out:
1. Cycle 1: 1-4-6-1
2. Cycle 2: 1-3-7-1
3. Cycle 3: 1-4-9-1
4. Cycle 4: 1-3-5-1
5. Cycle 5: 1-6-9-1
6. Cycle 6: 1-6-2-1
7. Cycle 7: 3-7-9-3
8. Cycle 8: 3-1-4-3
9. Cycle 9: 3-5-7-3
10. Cycle 10: 3-5-2-3
11. Cycle 11: 3-1-6-3
12. Cycle 12: 3-2-5-3
13. Cycle 13: 6-4-9-6
14. Cycle 14: 6-1-4-6
15. Cycle 15: 6-1-3-6
16. Cycle 16: 6-2-9-6
17. Cycle 17: 6-2-5-6
18. Cycle 18: 9-4-1-9
19. Cycle 19: 9-7-3-9
20. Cycle 20: 9-1-6-9
21. Cycle 21: 9-2-6-9
22. Cycle 22: 9-2-3-9
23. Cycle 23: 8-7-5-8
24. Cycle 24: 8-7-3-8
25. Cycle 25: 5-4-9-5
26. Cycle 26: 5-7-3-5
27. Cycle 27: 5-3-1-5
28. Cycle 28: 5-2-6-5
29. Cycle 29: 2-3-5-2
30. Cycle 30: 2-3-1-2
31. Cycle 31: 2-6-4-2
32. Cycle 32: 2-6-9-2
33. Cycle 33: 2-8-7-2
34. Cycle 34: 2-5-3-2
35. Cycle 35: 0-1-4-0
36. Cycle 36: 0-1-3-0
37. Cycle 37: 0-1-6-0
38. Cycle 38: 0-2-5-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

After analyzing each cycle, we find that there are two unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph with exactly one chord:
1. <1, (1-6), 9>
2. <2, (2-6), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

As there are two unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
