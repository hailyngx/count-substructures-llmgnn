Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: (0, 7, 9, 4)  
- Cycle 2: (0, 7, 1, 9)  
- Cycle 3: (0, 7, 6, 9)  
- Cycle 4: (0, 7, 4, 1)  
- Cycle 5: (0, 7, 9, 6)  
- Cycle 6: (0, 7, 4, 8)  
- Cycle 7: (0, 7, 6, 5)  
- Cycle 8: (0, 7, 1, 4)  
- Cycle 9: (0, 7, 4, 9)  
- Cycle 10: (0, 7, 1, 9, 4)  
- Cycle 11: (0, 7, 1, 4, 9)  
- Cycle 12: (0, 7, 4, 9, 1)  
- Cycle 13: (0, 7, 4, 1, 9)  
- Cycle 14: (7, 6, 9, 4)  
- Cycle 15: (7, 6, 5, 8)  
- Cycle 16: (7, 6, 2, 8)  
- Cycle 17: (7, 6, 9, 1)  
- Cycle 18: (7, 6, 9, 0)  
- Cycle 19: (7, 6, 5, 0)  
- Cycle 20: (7, 6, 2, 8, 5)  
- Cycle 21: (7, 6, 2, 8, 0)  
- Cycle 22: (7, 6, 9, 1, 4)  
- Cycle 23: (7, 6, 9, 4, 1)  
- Cycle 24: (7, 6, 9, 4, 8)  
- Cycle 25: (7, 6, 5, 8, 4)  
- Cycle 26: (7, 6, 5, 0, 3)  
- Cycle 27: (7, 6, 5, 8, 0)  
- Cycle 28: (7, 6, 2, 8, 4)  
- Cycle 29: (7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 0)  
- Cycle 30: (7, 6, 9, 1, 4, 8)  
- Cycle 31: (7, 6, 9, 1, 4, 0)  
- Cycle 32: (7, 6, 9, 4, 1, 0)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
Out of the listed cycles, the following cycle has one chord:  
- Cycle 10: (0, 7, 1, 9, 4) with chord (1, 9)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
The final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [31].  

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 7, 1, 9, 4>.
