Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 8, 2, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 4, 1, 9, 3)
- Cycle 5: (4, 1, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 6: (5, 0, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 7, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 8: (6, 0, 1, 9, 6)
- Cycle 9: (7, 3, 9, 6, 7)
- Cycle 10: (8, 2, 1, 9, 8)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (6, 9), 1>
- <2, (6, 8), 1>
- <3, (4, 5), 3>
- <4, (1, 9), 3>
- <5, (6, 9), 4>
- <6, (0, 6), 5>
- <7, (3, 4), 5>
- <8, (0, 1), 6>
- <9, (3, 6), 7>
- <10, (1, 9), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are total 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
