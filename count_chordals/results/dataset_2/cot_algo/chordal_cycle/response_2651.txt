Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (4, 1, 7, 8, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 6, 9, 1, 4)
- Cycle 3: (1, 9, 7, 5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 9, 0, 5, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 7, 5, 0, 1)
- Cycle 6: (6, 9, 0, 3, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 6 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [2].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <4, 1, 5, 7, (1, 5)>
- <6, 9, 0, 3, 6>
