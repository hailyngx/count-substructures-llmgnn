Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 4) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 8) (4, 14) (4, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 7) 

Response:
In this graph, the chordal 4-cycles can be found as follows:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 14, 4, 3, 2, 9, 12, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 2, 11, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 1, 14, 13, 7, 6, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 13, 7, 6, 12, 8, 1, 5, 0)
- Cycle 5: (1, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10, 13, 0, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 5, 0, 6, 12, 3, 2, 11, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 14, 11, 10, 13, 7, 6, 5, 1)
- Cycle 8: (2, 9, 12, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 2)
- Cycle 9: (3, 2, 11, 10, 13, 14, 4, 3)
- Cycle 10: (4, 14, 1, 8, 7, 6, 12, 3, 4)
- Cycle 11: (7, 11, 10, 13, 14, 4, 3, 8, 7)
- Cycle 12: (8, 2, 3, 4, 14, 13, 7, 12, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (1, 4) is a chord
- Cycle 2: (1, 11) is a chord
- Cycle 3: (5, 14) is a chord
- Cycle 4: (0, 8) is a chord
- Cycle 5: (10, 1) is a chord
- Cycle 6: (5, 6) is a chord
- Cycle 7: (5, 0) is a chord
- Cycle 8: (9, 7) is a chord
- Cycle 9: (2, 10) is a chord
- Cycle 10: (2, 6) is a chord
- Cycle 11: (8, 4) is a chord
- Cycle 12: (11, 12) is a chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are no chordless cycles among the listed cycles.

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
