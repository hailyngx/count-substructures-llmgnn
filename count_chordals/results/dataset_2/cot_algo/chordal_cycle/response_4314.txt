Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 26) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 23) (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 7) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 25) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 2) (10, 24) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 19) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 0) (5, 20) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 23) (26, 11) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 25) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 20) (17, 19) (20, 11) (20, 27) (20, 5) (20, 17) (9, 11) (9, 29) (9, 12) (29, 9) (29, 7) (29, 12) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 28) (2, 21) (23, 3) (23, 5) (23, 14) (23, 26) (1, 25) (1, 28) (1, 7) (7, 27) (7, 18) (7, 29) (7, 1) (21, 13) (21, 2) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 1) (24, 10) (12, 9) (12, 29) (28, 15) (28, 2) (28, 1) (28, 19) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 11 -> 16 -> 17 -> 13 -> 11
- Cycle 2: 15 -> 27 -> 7 -> 1 -> 15
- Cycle 3: 18 -> 22 -> 26 -> 25 -> 18
- Cycle 4: 8 -> 15 -> 27 -> 20 -> 8
- Cycle 5: 20 -> 11 -> 9 -> 29 -> 20
- Cycle 6: 5 -> 6 -> 18 -> 7 -> 5
- Cycle 7: 0 -> 5 -> 23 -> 14 -> 0
- Cycle 8: 13 -> 17 -> 0 -> 5 -> 13
- Cycle 9: 2 -> 22 -> 26 -> 23 -> 2
- Cycle 10: 28 -> 15 -> 8 -> 13 -> 28
- Cycle 11: 19 -> 13 -> 17 -> 20 -> 19
- Cycle 12: 29 -> 9 -> 11 -> 12 -> 29
- Cycle 13: 1 -> 25 -> 18 -> 7 -> 1
- Cycle 14: 21 -> 13 -> 17 -> 0 -> 21

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal cycles:
- Cycle 5: 20 -> 11 -> 9 -> 29 -> 20 (chord: 11-29)
- Cycle 12: 29 -> 9 -> 11 -> 12 -> 29 (chord: 9-11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

There are [2] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, (11, 29)>
<12, (9, 11)>
