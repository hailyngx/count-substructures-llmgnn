Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 8) (21, 20) (21, 23) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 17) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 16) (3, 2) (14, 25) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 11) (2, 3) (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 15) (29, 1) (29, 2) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 26) (27, 25) (27, 22) (27, 19) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 23) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 26) (8, 18) (23, 21) (23, 9) (24, 3) (24, 25) (22, 2) (22, 27) (22, 26) (26, 12) (26, 8) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 15) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 10) (13, 10) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 25) (20, 21) (10, 26) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 15) (15, 2) (15, 12) (15, 26) (15, 10) (16, 3) (16, 28) (16, 18) (28, 1) (28, 5) (28, 16) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 25) (25, 14) (25, 27) (25, 24) (25, 0) (25, 11) (19, 2) (19, 27) (18, 8) (18, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (1, 29, 2, 3, 4, 17, 7, 6, 12, 15, 2, 29, 1)
- Cycle 2: (7, 6, 12, 11, 17, 4, 9, 23, 21, 20, 23, 9, 4, 3, 2, 29, 2, 15, 12, 6, 7)
- Cycle 3: (6, 7, 4, 3, 16, 28, 1, 8, 0, 7, 17, 11, 12, 15, 26, 22, 2, 3, 24, 25, 11, 12, 6)
- Cycle 4: (3, 2, 15, 10, 13, 10, 5, 28, 16, 3)
- Cycle 5: (5, 28, 16, 18, 8, 1, 29, 2, 22, 26, 12, 6, 7, 17, 11, 25, 24, 3, 4, 9, 23, 21, 20, 23, 9, 4, 7, 0, 8, 26, 22, 27, 25, 0, 5, 10, 15, 12, 11, 25, 27, 19, 2, 3)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (2, 15) -> <(1, 29), (2, 15), 3)>
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (12, 6) -> <(7, 6), (12, 6), 7)>
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (4, 17) -> <(6, 7), (4, 17), 11)>
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (15, 3) -> <(3, 2), (15, 3), 16)>
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (22, 5) -> <(5, 28), (22, 5), 16)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
