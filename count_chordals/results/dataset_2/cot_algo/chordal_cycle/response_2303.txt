Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 0) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 10) (18, 9) (18, 4) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 1) (12, 17) (11, 3) (11, 19) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 16) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (3, 9, 5, 4)
- Cycle 2: (9, 5, 6, 1)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 2, 14)
- Cycle 4: (6, 2, 5, 8)
- Cycle 5: (2, 14, 0, 1)
- Cycle 6: (14, 0, 15, 19)
- Cycle 7: (0, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 8: (1, 6, 5, 9)
- Cycle 9: (6, 5, 9, 3)
- Cycle 10: (5, 9, 18, 4)
- Cycle 11: (9, 18, 4, 10)
- Cycle 12: (18, 4, 5, 6)
- Cycle 13: (4, 5, 2, 14)
- Cycle 14: (5, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 15: (2, 6, 1, 13)
- Cycle 16: (6, 1, 0, 14)
- Cycle 17: (1, 0, 15, 19)
- Cycle 18: (0, 15, 19, 14)
- Cycle 19: (15, 19, 11, 3)
- Cycle 20: (19, 11, 3, 9)
- Cycle 21: (11, 3, 9, 5)
- Cycle 22: (3, 9, 1, 13)
- Cycle 23: (9, 1, 13, 10)
- Cycle 24: (1, 13, 17, 12)
- Cycle 25: (13, 17, 12, 10)
- Cycle 26: (17, 12, 16, 10)
- Cycle 27: (12, 17, 14, 0)
- Cycle 28: (17, 14, 2, 5)
- Cycle 29: (14, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 30: (2, 5, 8, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

The only cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <3, (9, 5), 11, 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final answer is [1].
