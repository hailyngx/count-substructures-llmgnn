Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-5-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-2-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-7-6-0
- Cycle 4: 0-4-6-7-0
- Cycle 5: 1-2-4-8-1
- Cycle 6: 1-3-7-2-1
- Cycle 7: 4-8-2-7-4
- Cycle 8: 5-8-1-9-5
- Cycle 9: 6-7-3-0-6
- Cycle 10: 9-7-3-1-9
- Cycle 11: 9-4-8-5-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
- <0, (1, 8), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 0 chordless cycle found.

Putting it all together, we have [1].
