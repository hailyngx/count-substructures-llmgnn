Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

3. (4, 11, 18, 21, 4)
4. (4, 11, 23, 14, 4)
5. (4, 11, 24, 1, 4)
6. (7, 24, 1, 23, 7)
7. (20, 25, 5, 13, 20)
8. (20, 25, 10, 27, 20)
9. (20, 25, 10, 2, 20)
10. (20, 26, 27, 28, 20)
11. (20, 28, 17, 9, 20)
12. (22, 29, 6, 16, 22)
13. (22, 29, 8, 0, 22)
14. (22, 29, 8, 20, 22)
15. (23, 14, 17, 28, 23)
16. (25, 5, 13, 16, 25)
17. (25, 10, 27, 26, 25)
18. (26, 27, 16, 6, 26)
19. (26, 27, 28, 20, 26)
20. (26, 12, 0, 22, 26)
21. (28, 17, 14, 23, 28)
22. (5, 25, 10, 27, 5)
23. (8, 22, 29, 6, 8)
24. (10, 27, 26, 12, 10)
25. (10, 27, 28, 20, 10)
26. (13, 5, 25, 10, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <1, (24, 7), 11, (18, 21)>
2. <2, (10, 25), 27, (26, 20)>
3. <4, (11, 24), 1, (23, 14)>
4. <5, (25, 10), 27, (26, 20)>
5. <6, (29, 8), 22, (22, 29)>
6. <8, (29, 6), 16 , (27, 26)>
7. <10, (27, 26), 12, (26, 20)>
8. <13, (5, 25), 10, (25, 13)>
9. <16, (27, 26), 12, (26, 20)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles found is [17].
