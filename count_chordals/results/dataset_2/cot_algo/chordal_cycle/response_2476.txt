Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 10) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
1. Cycle <1, 3, 8, 4>
2. Cycle <1, 3, 12, 4>
3. Cycle <1, 7, 14, 0>
4. Cycle <1, 7, 13, 3>
5. Cycle <1, 7, 5, 2>
6. Cycle <3, 8, 4, 12>
7. Cycle <3, 12, 11, 4>
8. Cycle <4, 8, 3, 1>
9. Cycle <4, 12, 11, 5>
10. Cycle <7, 14, 13, 3>
11. Cycle <7, 13, 10, 2>
12. Cycle <7, 5, 11, 4>
13. Cycle <8, 3, 1, 6>
14. Cycle <8, 4, 12, 11>
15. Cycle <12, 4, 11, 5>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (forming chordal 4-cycles) are:
1. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 3, 12, 4> with chord (1, 4)
2. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 7, 13, 3> with chord (1, 3)
3. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 7, 5, 2> with chord (1, 5)
4. Chordal 4-cycle <3, 12, 11, 4> with chord (3, 11)
5. Chordal 4-cycle <4, 12, 11, 5> with chord (4, 5)
6. Chordal 4-cycle <7, 14, 13, 3> with chord (7, 13)
7. Chordal 4-cycle <7, 13, 10, 2> with chord (7, 10)
8. Chordal 4-cycle <7, 5, 11, 4> with chord (7, 11)

Step 3:
Total number of chordless cycles found = [7]
