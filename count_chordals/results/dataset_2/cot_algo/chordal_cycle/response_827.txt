Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  

There are several cycles in the given graph, some of them are:  
1. Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 13 - 0 - 6  
2. Cycle 2: 6 - 9 - 13 - 11 - 12 - 7 - 6  
3. Cycle 3: 6 - 1 - 10 - 2 - 7 - 6  
4. Cycle 4: 6 - 4 - 14 - 3 - 5 - 4  
5. Cycle 5: 6 - 7 - 12 - 11 - 10 - 1 - 6  
6. Cycle 6: 6 - 4 - 5 - 0 - 10 - 1 - 6  
7. Cycle 7: 6 - 4 - 7 - 2 - 10 - 1 - 6  
8. and more..  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  

After checking all cycles, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:   
<6, 1, 3, 9>: Chord (6, 9)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  

The final number of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord is [1].  

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <6, 1, 3, 9> with the chord (6, 9).
