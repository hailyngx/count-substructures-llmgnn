Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 16) (10, 15) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 14) (18, 9) (18, 12) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 19) (1, 4) (1, 9) (13, 9) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 5) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 16) (6, 4) (6, 19) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 19) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (3, 11, 7, 14, 2, 9, 13)
- Cycle 2: (15, 16, 7, 0, 17, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (15, 10, 17, 4, 1, 9, 2)
- Cycle 4: (10, 15, 16, 7, 0, 11, 5)
- Cycle 5: (17, 0, 11, 5, 16, 7, 14)
- Cycle 6: (17, 4, 1, 9, 13, 2, 14)
- Cycle 7: (4, 17, 0, 11, 5, 8, 12)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 12, 18, 9, 1, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 1, 9, 18, 12, 11, 0)
- Cycle 10: (4, 6, 19, 12, 18, 2, 14)
- Cycle 11: (8, 3, 11, 0, 7, 14, 2)
        
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (2, 9) and (9, 13)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (7, 0)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 4 has 0 chords
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (0, 11)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (0, 11)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (8, 12)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (9, 18)
- Cycle 10 has 2 chords: (4, 6) and (18, 2)
- Cycle 11 has 0 chords
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:

There are 6 chordal 4-cycles. Thus, the final answer is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <3, 11, 5, 16> 
- <15, 16, 7, 0>
- <10, 15, 16, 7>
- <17, 0, 11, 5>
- <17, 4, 1, 9>
- <4, 8, 12, 18>
