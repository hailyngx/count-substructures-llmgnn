Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (4, 0, 7, 10, 5) 
        - Cycle 2: (4, 6, 3, 7, 10)
        - Cycle 3: (4, 6, 13, 5, 10)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 11, 10, 7, 3)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 11, 14, 12, 6)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1: (4, 0, 7, 10, 5) has a unique chord (7, 5), thus it is a chordal 4-cycle.
        - Cycle 2: (4, 6, 3, 7, 10) has a unique chord (6, 10), thus it is a chordal 4-cycle.
        - Cycle 3: (4, 6, 13, 5, 10) has a unique chord (6, 5), thus it is a chordal 4-cycle.
        - Cycle 4: (4, 11, 10, 7, 3) has a unique chord (11, 7), thus it is a chordal 4-cycle.
        - Cycle 5: (4, 11, 14, 12, 6) has no unique chord, so it is a chordless cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There is 1 chordless cycle.

Final answer: [4] 
Unique chordal 4-cycles found:  
<4, (0, 7), 10, 5)>
<4, 6, (3, 7), 10>
<4, 6, (13, 5), 10>
<4, (11, 10), 7, 3)>
