Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 12) (26, 19) (26, 15) (26, 3) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 15) (6, 19) (3, 26) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 0) (20, 25) (20, 11) (12, 9) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 1) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 2) (0, 3) (0, 25) (0, 4) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 29) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 21) (8, 7) (17, 29) (17, 7) (29, 4) (29, 17) (29, 23) (18, 27) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 13) (19, 26) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 23) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 15) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 23) (16, 1) (24, 6) (24, 18) (24, 5) (11, 20) (11, 7) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (15, 26) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 23) (15, 2) (14, 7) (14, 21) (22, 10) (22, 21) (23, 29) (23, 19) (23, 1) (23, 15) (2, 27) (2, 11) (2, 15) (21, 9) (21, 8) (21, 14) (21, 22) (13, 18) (10, 22) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (19, 26, 15, 6, 19)
- Cycle 2: (25, 3, 26, 19, 23, 29, 4, 0, 25)
- Cycle 3: (3, 26, 19, 23, 1, 12, 5, 15, 26)
- Cycle 4: (3, 26, 19, 8, 4, 0, 25, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 8, 4, 29, 23, 19, 26, 3)
- Cycle 6: (25, 0, 4, 29, 17, 7, 11, 20, 25)
- Cycle 7: (0, 4, 29, 23, 15, 26, 3, 0)
- Cycle 8: (8, 19, 26, 15, 5, 24, 18, 4, 8)
- Cycle 9: (7, 8, 19, 26, 15, 2, 11, 20, 25, 0, 4, 18, 24, 5, 15, 23, 29, 17, 7)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (19, 6)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (23, 15)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (26, 5)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (4, 19)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (8, 23)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (29, 11)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (4, 15)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (24, 26)
- Cycle 9 has no chords

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (19, 6)>
<2, (23, 15)>
<3, (26, 5)>
<4, (4, 19)>
<5, (8, 23)>
<6, (29, 11)>
<7, (4, 15)>
<8, (24, 26)>
