Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 26) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 12) (1, 21) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 29) (27, 17) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 29) (6, 22) (6, 26) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 26) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 29) (13, 4) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 17) (17, 3) (17, 27) (17, 5) (17, 0) (23, 11) (23, 21) (23, 19) (14, 28) (14, 29) (26, 16) (26, 5) (26, 6) (26, 7) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 9) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 18) (9, 10) (25, 15) (25, 19) (25, 24) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 24) (19, 23) (19, 25) (29, 11) (29, 21) (29, 6) (29, 12) (29, 14) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 20) (18, 5) (18, 28) (22, 11) (22, 15) (22, 21) (22, 6) (22, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- 4-cycles: <11, 16, 26, 5, 11>
- 4-cycles: <11, 29, 6, 26, 16>
- 4-cycles: <15, 22, 6, 29, 12, 15>
- 4-cycles: <21, 1, 10, 0, 21>
- 4-cycles: <21, 29, 12, 7, 0, 21>
- 4-cycles: <29, 12, 15, 22, 6, 29>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <11, (16), 26, 5, 11>
- <11, (29), 6, 26, 16>
- <15, 22, (6), 29, 12, 15>
- <21, 1, 10, (0), 21>
- <21, (29), 12, 7, 0, 21>
- <29, 12, 15, (22), 6, 29>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

- There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the final answer is [6].
