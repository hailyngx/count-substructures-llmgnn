Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 17) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (7, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 11) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 19) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 0) (12, 8) (12, 19) (16, 9) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 19) (13, 15) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <3, 4, 8, 3>
        - <3, 11, 17, 15, 6, 19, 3>
        - <3, 11, 17, 15, 13, 2, 8, 4, 18, 0, 1, 10, 9, 5, 14, 6, 19, 12, 8, 3>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <3, 4, 8, 3> has no chords.
        - <3, 11, 17, 15, 6, 19, 3> has no chords.
        - <3, 11, 17, 15, 13, 2, 8, 4, 18, 0, 1, 10, 9, 5, 14, 6, 19, 12, 8, 3> has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
        As all of the cycles found are chordless, the count is [0].
