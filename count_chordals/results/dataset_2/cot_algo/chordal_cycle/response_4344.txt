Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 5) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 1) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 12) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 13) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 16) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (14, 2) (4, 17) (4, 19) (9, 16) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 11) (12, 15) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 0) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 6)

- (15, 19, 4, 17, 15)
- (15, 13, 6, 8, 15)
- (15, 12, 11, 16, 15)
- (19, 7, 3, 2, 19)
- (19, 4, 17, 10, 19)
- (19, 13, 6, 8, 19)
- (1, 11, 16, 18, 1)
- (1, 9, 2, 3, 1)
- (6, 8, 0, 11, 6)
- (6, 13, 15, 12, 6)
- (3, 7, 19, 18, 3)
- (7, 5, 16, 9, 7)
- (5, 7, 19, 4, 5)
- (0, 11, 1, 9, 0)
- (0, 8, 17, 4, 0)
- (14, 2, 9, 1, 14)
- (4, 17, 10, 15, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <11, (1, 18), 16, 11>
- <16, (9, 2), 11, 16>
- <10, (8, 17), 11, 10>
- <17, (4, 19), 10, 17>
- <2, (3, 7), 9, 2>
- <18, (16, 19), 15, 18>
- <15, (13, 6), 8, 15>
- <19, (7, 3), 2, 19>
- <1, (9, 2), 11, 1>
- <6, (8, 0), 11, 6>
- <3, (7, 19), 2, 3>
- <7, (5, 16), 9, 7>
- <5, (7, 19), 4, 5>
- <0, (8, 11), 16, 0>
