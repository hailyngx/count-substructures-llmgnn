Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 7, 1, 6, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 7, 1, 9, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 7, 1, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 0)

Step 2: 
Checking for one chord:
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (1, 3) connecting non-adjacent vertices 1 and 3.

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <<0, 7, 1, 6>, (1, 3)>; <0, 7, 1, 9, 0>; <0, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 0>>
