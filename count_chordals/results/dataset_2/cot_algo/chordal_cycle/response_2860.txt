Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 3) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 11, 1) with edges: (4, 7), (7, 11), (11, 1), (1, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 11, 8, 5) with edges: (4, 11), (11, 8), (8, 5), (5, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 5, 8, 11) with edges: (4, 5), (5, 8), (8, 11), (11, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 1, 2, 13) with edges: (7, 1), (1, 2), (2, 13), (13, 7)
- Cycle 5: (10, 11, 8, 9) with edges: (10, 11), (11, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10)
- Cycle 6: (10, 9, 13, 0) with edges: (10, 9), (9, 13), (13, 0), (0, 10)
- Cycle 7: (8, 11, 7, 4) with edges: (8, 11), (11, 7), (7, 4), (4, 8)
- Cycle 8: (8, 9, 13, 2) with edges: (8, 9), (9, 13), (13, 2), (2, 8)
- Cycle 9: (8, 13, 0, 6) with edges: (8, 13), (13, 0), (0, 6), (6, 8)
- Cycle 10: (9, 8, 13, 6) with edges: (9, 8), (8, 13), (13, 6), (6, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 13, 2, 12) with edges: (9, 13), (13, 2), (2, 12), (12, 9)
- Cycle 12: (9, 0, 6, 10) with edges: (9, 0), (0, 6), (6, 10), (10, 9)
- Cycle 13: (0, 13, 9, 10) with edges: (0, 13), (13, 9), (9, 10), (10, 0)
- Cycle 14: (13, 9, 10, 6) with edges: (13, 9), (9, 10), (10, 6), (6, 13)
- Cycle 15: (13, 0, 6, 3) with edges: (13, 0), (0, 6), (6, 3), (3, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <1, (7, 11), 4)>
- <4, (5, 8), 11>
- <4, (5, 8), 11>
- <1, (2, 13), 7>
- <10, (11, 8), 9>
- <10, (9, 13), 6>
- <7, (4, 11), 8>
- <8, (9, 13), 2>
- <8, (13, 0), 9>
- <9, (8, 13), 6>
- <9, (13, 2), 12>
- <10, (9, 0), 6>
- <9, (10, 0), 13>
- <9, (13, 6), 10>
- <13, (0, 6), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 15 chordal 4-cycles in this graph, so the answer is [15].
