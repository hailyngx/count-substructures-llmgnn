Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. Cycle 1: 6 - 3 - 1 - 5 - 6
2. Cycle 2: 6 - 8 - 1 - 5 - 6
3. Cycle 3: 6 - 8 - 2 - 9 - 6
4. Cycle 4: 6 - 3 - 1 - 8 - 6
5. Cycle 5: 6 - 4 - 9 - 7 - 6
6. Cycle 6: 6 - 3 - 5 - 1 - 6
7. Cycle 7: 6 - 8 - 5 - 0 - 6
8. Cycle 8: 6 - 4 - 0 - 5 - 6
9. Cycle 9: 6 - 4 - 9 - 11 - 6

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, Cycle 4 has exactly one chord, which is the edge between nodes 3 and 8: (3, 8). So, we have one chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 8.

Therefore, the final answer is [8]. The unique chordal 4-cycle is <(3, 8), (6, 4), 9, 7)>.
