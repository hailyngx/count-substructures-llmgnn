- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 8, 17, 3> with chord (1, 3)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 8, 17, 15> with chord (2, 15)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 19, 0, 14> with chord (4, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 9, 13, 2> with chord (5, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 18, 11, 1> with chord (6, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <8, 17, 14, 0> with chord (8, 0)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 13, 2, 8> with chord (9, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <10, 1, 8, 17> with chord (10, 17)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <11, 18, 6, 14> with chord (11, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <13, 9, 5, 16> with chord (13, 16)

Step 3:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
