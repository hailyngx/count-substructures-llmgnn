Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 12) (2, 29) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 6) (27, 3) (27, 26) (27, 19) (20, 25) (20, 22) (20, 4) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 16) (25, 8) (18, 5) (18, 7) (28, 16) (28, 9) (16, 3) (16, 25) (16, 28) (16, 13) (7, 25) (7, 18) (9, 28) (9, 13) (4, 20) (4, 14) (4, 21) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 18) (5, 10) (5, 14) (26, 27) (23, 1) (23, 6) (10, 5) (10, 14) (19, 27) (19, 17) (19, 6) (0, 12) (0, 11) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 19) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 11) (13, 15) (13, 25) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 21) (21, 4) (21, 13) (21, 22) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 24) (8, 11) (8, 22) (24, 8) (1, 23) (1, 14) (1, 22) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 1) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 17) (11, 8) (22, 20) (22, 21) (22, 8) (22, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 13, 25, 16, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 27, 26, 19, 6, 29, 2, 11, 17, 3)
- Cycle 3: (4, 20, 22, 1, 23, 6, 29, 2, 11, 0, 12, 14, 4)
- Cycle 4: (5, 18, 7, 25, 13, 9, 28, 16, 3, 17, 11, 0, 12, 14, 5)
- Cycle 5: (8, 25, 13, 21, 22, 1, 14, 4, 20, 25, 7, 18, 5, 14, 10, 5)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges) are:
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (3, 15), 13, 25, 16>
- Chordal cycle 2: <2, 11, 17, (3, 27), 26>
- Chordal cycle 3: <1, 23, 6, 29, 2, 11, 0, 12>
- Chordal cycle 4: <5, 18, 7, 25, 13, 9, 28, 16>
- Chordal cycle 5: <8, 25, 13, 21, 22, 1, 14, 4>

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
Therefore, the final count is [5].
