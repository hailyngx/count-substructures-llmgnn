Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 17) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 7) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 0) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 16) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 14) (14, 6) (14, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 12) (9, 2) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 19) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (1, 7, 13, 16, 1), (1, 12, 17, 18, 1), (1, 12, 11, 2, 1)
- Cycle with 5 nodes: (4, 9, 2, 11, 4), (4, 6, 14, 16, 4)
- Cycle with 6 nodes: (9, 12, 17, 11, 2, 9), (9, 12, 1, 7, 13, 9)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle (1, 7, 13, 16, 1): Chord <13, 7>
- Cycle (1, 12, 17, 18, 1): Chord <17, 12>
- Cycle (1, 12, 11, 2, 1): Chord <11, 12>
- Cycle (4, 9, 2, 11, 4): Chord <9, 2>
- Cycle (4, 6, 14, 16, 4): Chord <6, 14>
- Cycle (9, 12, 17, 11, 2, 9): Chord <17, 2>

Step 3:
Count of unique chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 7, 13, 16, 1> with chord <13, 7>
<1, 12, 17, 18, 1> with chord <17, 12>
<1, 12, 11, 2, 1> with chord <11, 12>
<4, 9, 2, 11, 4> with chord <9, 2>
<4, 6, 14, 16, 4> with chord <6, 14>
<9, 12, 17, 11, 2, 9> with chord <17, 2>
