Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0-8-9-5-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-8-2-5-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-8-2-7-4-0
- Cycle 4: 0-8-2-7-6-1-4-0
- Cycle 5: 0-8-2-7-6-9-5-4-0
- Cycle 6: 0-8-2-7-6-1-3-7-4-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0-8-9-5-4-0> has a chord (5, 9)
<0-8-2-5-4-0> has a chord (2, 5)
<0-8-2-7-4-0> has two chords (7, 2) and (4, 7)
<0-8-2-7-6-1-4-0> has two chords (6, 1) and (4, 7)
<0-8-2-7-6-9-5-4-0> has two chords (6, 9) and (5, 9)
<0-8-2-7-6-1-3-7-4-0> has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
