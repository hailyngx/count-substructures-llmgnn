Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 22) (1, 18) (21, 20) (21, 9) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 20) (9, 21) (9, 6) (9, 27) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 25) (27, 9) (27, 0) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 7) (14, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 2) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 24) (18, 1) (18, 25) (18, 3) (19, 26) (19, 28) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 11) (13, 26) (13, 20) (15, 6) (15, 25) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 25) (7, 14) (7, 10) (11, 14) (11, 26) (11, 24) (8, 6) (8, 28) (8, 22) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 8) (28, 5) (24, 10) (24, 16) (24, 11) (24, 12) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 23) (5, 14) (5, 28) (5, 2) (5, 29) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 12) (3, 22) (20, 21) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 23) (12, 24) (12, 3) (12, 25) (12, 22) (23, 2) (23, 20) (23, 29) (29, 5) (29, 23) (25, 0) (25, 18) (25, 15) (25, 16) (25, 12) (22, 1) (22, 8) (22, 3) (22, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: 1-22-8-6-9-27-0-25-15-6 
- Cycle 2: 1-22-8-28-19-26-11-14-5-2-17-3-18-25-16-24-11 
- Cycle 3: 21-20-13-26-19-28-14-7-10-17-3-18-25-16-24-11
- Cycle 4: 3-22-12-24-16-25-0-27-9-6-15-25-12

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (6, 27), 15, 22>
- <11, (14, 24), 19, 3>
- <13, (26, 14), 7, 20>
- <12, (22, 16),  25, 3>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, therefore the final count is [4].
