Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 6) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 11) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 14) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 18) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 9) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 12) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (12, 16) (12, 10) (9, 7) (18, 6) (18, 17) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 0) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 18) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 0) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (13, 14) (0, 19) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
1. (3, 15, 6, 1)
2. (1, 5, 0, 19)
3. (4, 8, 16, 12)
4. (7, 16, 12, 10)
5. (16, 8, 4, 11)
6. (10, 14, 13, 7)
7. (2, 7, 9, 0)

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<1, (5, 0), 19> 

Step 3:
As we found one unique chordal 4-cycle, the total count is [1].
