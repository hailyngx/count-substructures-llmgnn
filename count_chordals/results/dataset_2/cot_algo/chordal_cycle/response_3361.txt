Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 22) (14, 18) (14, 20) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 15) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 10) (2, 7) (29, 5) (29, 11) (22, 14) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 6) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 6) (20, 14) (20, 21) (20, 28) (5, 29) (5, 23) (5, 6) (5, 27) (6, 23) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 0) (18, 14) (18, 19) (26, 2) (26, 10) (26, 4) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 24) (1, 8) (3, 22) (3, 10) (21, 20) (21, 19) (21, 4) (8, 1) (8, 12) (9, 4) (9, 11) (25, 0) (25, 11) (27, 17) (27, 5) (19, 17) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 21) (12, 2) (12, 8) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 7) (0, 17) (0, 6) (0, 25) (0, 16) (0, 24) (16, 0) (16, 13) (4, 26) (4, 21) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 2) (7, 10) (24, 1) (24, 0) (24, 13) (28, 20) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 24) (11, 29) (11, 9) (11, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        Cycles of length 4: 
        1. (14, 22, 23, 5, 29, 11, 25, 0, 17, 15, 1, 10, 2, 12, 8, 1)
        2. (14, 22, 19, 18, 14)
        3. (17, 15, 6, 23, 22, 19, 17)
        4. (17, 15, 6, 5, 29, 11, 25, 0, 16, 13, 24, 1, 8, 12, 2, 26, 4, 21, 20, 14)
        5. (17, 15, 6, 0, 16, 13, 24, 1, 8, 12, 2, 26, 4, 21, 20, 14, 18, 19, 22, 23)
        6. (17, 15, 6, 0, 16, 13, 24, 1, 8, 12, 2, 26, 10, 3, 21, 20, 14, 18, 19, 22, 23)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
        <2, (14, 22), 19>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        Number of chordless cycles found: [5]
