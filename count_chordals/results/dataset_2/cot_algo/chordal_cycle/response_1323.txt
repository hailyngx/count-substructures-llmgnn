Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4: (5, 4, 6, 7), (5, 7, 9, 1), (5, 6, 4, 2), (5, 8, 1, 9), (4, 6, 7, 3), (4, 2, 1, 8), (7, 9, 0, 3), (9, 1, 6, 7), (1, 8, 2, 6), (3, 0, 9, 2), (8, 5, 6, 1), (6, 7, 3, 0), (6, 2, 1, 8)
- Cycles of length 5 or more: None

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
<5, (8, 1), 9, 7>
<4, (2, 6), 7, 3>
<7, (9, 0), 3, 6>
<9, (1, 7), 5, 6>
<1, (8, 2), 4, 6>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, (8, 1), 9, 7>
<4, (2, 6), 7, 3>
<7, (9, 0), 3, 6>
<9, (1, 7), 5, 6>
<1, (8, 2), 4, 6>
