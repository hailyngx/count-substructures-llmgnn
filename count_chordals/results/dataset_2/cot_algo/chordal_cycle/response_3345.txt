Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1-3-7-4-1
2. Cycle 1-3-2-9-1
3. Cycle 1-3-4-9-1
4. Cycle 1-8-4-9-1
5. Cycle 1-8-7-4-1
6. Cycle 1-8-5-6-1
7. Cycle 3-7-4-9-3
8. Cycle 3-7-8-1-3
9. Cycle 3-4-9-2-3
10. Cycle 3-4-7-8-3
11. Cycle 4-9-2-3-4
12. Cycle 4-9-7-8-4
13. Cycle 4-8-5-6-4
14. Cycle 7-8-1-3-7
15. Cycle 7-8-4-9-7
16. Cycle 7-3-1-8-7
17. Cycle 5-8-1-3-5
18. Cycle 5-8-4-9-5
19. Cycle 5-6-1-8-5
20. Cycle 6-1-3-7-6
21. Cycle 6-1-8-5-6
22. Cycle 9-2-3-7-9

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord (connecting non-adjacent nodes):
1. Cycle 1-3-7-4-1 <(1, 4)>
2. Cycle 1-8-7-4-1 <(1, 7)>
3. Cycle 3-7-4-9-3 <(3, 9)>
4. Cycle 4-9-2-3-4 <(4, 2)>
5. Cycle 7-3-1-8-7 <(7, 1)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, 3, 7, 4, 1> with non-adjacent chord (1, 4)
<1, 8, 7, 4, 1> with non-adjacent chord (1, 7)
<3, 7, 4, 9, 3> with non-adjacent chord (3, 9)
<4, 9, 2, 3, 4> with non-adjacent chord (4, 2)
<7, 3, 1, 8, 7> with non-adjacent chord (7, 1)
