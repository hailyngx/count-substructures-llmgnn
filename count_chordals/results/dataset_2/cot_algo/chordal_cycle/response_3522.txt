Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 7, 4, 9)
- Cycle 2: (5, 11, 10, 9, 4)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 7, 4, 2)
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 2, 4, 13)
- Cycle 5: (5, 1, 2, 4, 13)
- Cycle 6: (5, 1, 2, 6, 8)
- Cycle 7: (11, 10, 0, 7, 4)
- Cycle 8: (11, 2, 4, 7, 0)
- Cycle 9: (6, 7, 1, 5, 11)
- Cycle 10: (6, 2, 4, 9, 14)
- Cycle 11: (6, 2, 10, 0, 13)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (9, 4), 7>
- Cycle 2: <11, (9, 4), 10>
- Cycle 3: <5, (7, 4), 6>
- Cycle 4: <5, (6, 4), 13>
- Cycle 5: <5, (1, 4), 2>
- Cycle 6: <5, (1, 6), 8>
- Cycle 7: <11, (4, 7), 0>
- Cycle 8: <11, (2, 4), 7>
- Cycle 9: <6, (1, 5), 11>
- Cycle 10: <6, (9, 4), 14>
- Cycle 11: <6, (10, 0), 2>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph is [0].
