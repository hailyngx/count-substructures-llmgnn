Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:

<5, 9, 2, 6>
<5, 9, 4, 7>
<9, 4, 7, 2>
<4, 7, 2, 6>
<7, 2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 3, 8>
<6, 3, 8, 6> (Cyclic but not valid as 8-6 edge is missing)
<3, 8, 6, 0>
<8, 6, 0, 1>
<6, 0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 9, 5>
<1, 9, 5, 4>
<5, 4, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 6, 2>
<7, 6, 2, 9>
<6, 2, 9, 5>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
<5, 9, 2, 6> (chord: (9, 6))
<1, 9, 5, 4> (chord: (5, 9))

Step 3:
There are [2] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
