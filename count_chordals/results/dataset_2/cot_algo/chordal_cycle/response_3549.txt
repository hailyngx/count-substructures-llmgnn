Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (9, 13) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 27) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 3) (29, 8) (6, 24) (6, 27) (6, 0) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 4) (26, 23) (26, 3) (26, 0) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 23) (0, 19) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 20) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 27) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 16) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 23) (21, 4) (21, 16) (21, 22) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 23) (23, 26) (23, 0) (23, 16) (23, 24) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 27) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 20) (3, 17) (3, 26) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 20) (20, 7) (20, 19) (20, 11) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 8) (27, 9) (27, 6) (27, 1) (27, 13) (8, 29) (8, 10) (8, 12) (25, 2) (22, 21) (2, 4) (2, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (7, 14, 10, 1, 15, 19, 14)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 24, 12, 15, 1, 10)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 27, 13, 9, 18, 4)
- Cycle 4: (0, 7, 16, 21, 4, 18, 9)
- Cycle 5: (0, 7, 20, 11, 13, 27, 6)
- Cycle 6: (0, 23, 26, 3, 17, 6, 24)
- Cycle 7: (4, 18, 9, 27, 1, 15, 12)
- Cycle 8: (12, 24, 6, 0, 7, 14, 19)
- Cycle 9: (12, 8, 10, 14, 19, 15, 16)
- Cycle 10: (16, 7, 14, 19, 0, 23, 24)
- Cycle 11: (16, 21, 22, 25, 2, 4, 18)
- Cycle 12: (23, 26, 0, 7, 14, 19, 13)
  
Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (10, 14), 15, (12, 24)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, (13, 27), 0, (18, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (6, 24), 12, (15, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, (7, 16), 21, (4, 18)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (23, 26), 3, (17, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, (18, 9), 27, (1, 15)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <12, (8, 10), 14, (19, 15)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <16, (7, 14), 19, (0, 23)>

Step 3:
There are a total of 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].
