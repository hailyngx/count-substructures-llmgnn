Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: (5, 8, 6, 7)  
- Cycle 2: (8, 5, 1, 4)  
- Cycle 3: (4, 1, 6, 7)  
- Cycle 4: (0, 1, 4, 3)  
- Cycle 5: (1, 6, 7, 4)  
- Cycle 6: (6, 7, 4, 3)  
- Cycle 7: (7, 4, 1, 6)  
- Cycle 8: (4, 1, 0, 5)  
- Cycle 9: (1, 0, 3, 4)  
- Cycle 10: (0, 3, 4, 8)  
- Cycle 11: (3, 4, 8, 6)  
- Cycle 12: (4, 8, 5, 1)  
- Cycle 13: (8, 5, 0, 3)  
- Cycle 14: (5, 0, 1, 4)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <5, 8, 6, 7>: Chord (5, 6)  
- <8, 5, 1, 4>: Chord (8, 4)  
- <0, 1, 4, 3>: Chord (0, 3)  
- <1, 6, 7, 4>: Chord (1, 4)  
- <6, 7, 4, 3>: Chord (6, 3)  
- <7, 4, 1, 6>: Chord (7, 6)  
- <4, 1, 0, 5>: Chord (4, 5)  
- <1, 0, 3, 4>: Chord (1, 3)  
- <0, 3, 4, 8>: Chord (0, 8)  
- <3, 4, 8, 6>: Chord (3, 8)  
- <4, 8, 5, 1>: Chord (4, 8)  
- <8, 5, 0, 3>: Chord (8, 3)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are [0] chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
