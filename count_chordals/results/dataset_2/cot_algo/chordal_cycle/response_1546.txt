Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-3-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-14-9-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-6-10-0
- Cycle 4: 1-7-12-10-1
- Cycle 5: 1-7-9-14-1
- Cycle 6: 2-3-1-7-2
- Cycle 7: 2-11-13-4-2
- Cycle 8: 4-6-10-12-4
- Cycle 9: 4-13-11-2-4

Step 2: 
Among the cycles listed above, the cycles with exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle) are:
1. Cycle 1: <0-1-3-2-0, (1,3)>
2. Cycle 2: <0-5-14-9-7-0, (5,9)>
3. Cycle 3: <0-5-6-10-0, (5,6)>
4. Cycle 4: <1-7-12-10-1, (7,10)>
5. Cycle 5: <1-7-9-14-1, (7,14)>
6. Cycle 6: <2-3-1-7-2, (1,7)>
7. Cycle 7: <2-11-13-4-2, (11, 4)>
8. Cycle 8: <4-6-10-12-4, (6, 10)>
9. Cycle 9: <4-13-11-2-4, (13, 11)>

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have a total of [0] chordless 4-cycles.

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is:
<0-1-3-2-0, (1,3)>
