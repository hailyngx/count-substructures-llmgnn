Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (9, 11) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 16) (26, 4) (26, 17) (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 25) (21, 9) (21, 26) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 6) (17, 26) (17, 13) (17, 28) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 27) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 25) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 27) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 15) (23, 2) (23, 8) (4, 26) (4, 22) (4, 24) (15, 8) (15, 18) (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 22) (25, 1) (25, 2) (25, 20) (25, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 25) (28, 17) (28, 2) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 17) (13, 29) (13, 5) (6, 21) (6, 16) (6, 27) (12, 3) (16, 26) (16, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 24) (22, 4) (22, 20) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 10) (18, 15) (18, 10) (27, 7) (27, 3) (27, 20) (27, 6) (27, 19) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: 
We need to list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Some cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 9-26-16-6-9
- Cycle 2: 9-26-16-6-27-7-21-9
- Cycle 3: 9-26-17-13-29-2-25-1-9
- Cycle 4: 9-26-4-24-8-23-2-25-1-9
- Cycle 5: 9-26-21-1-3-27-6-16-9
- Cycle 6: 9-26-21-1-25-20-27-6-16-9
- Cycle 7: 9-26-21-7-11-25-1-9
- Cycle 8: 9-26-21-7-27-6-16-9
- Cycle 9: 9-26-21-7-27-20-25-1-9
- Cycle 10: 9-26-21-7-27-19-0-10-24-9
- and more...

Step 2:
We need to check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Some of the chordal 4-cycles found are as follows:
- <9, 26, 16, 6> with chord (26, 4)
- <9, 26, 21, 7> with chord (21, 1)
- <9, 26, 21, 7> with chord (21, 6)
- <9, 26, 21, 7> with chord (21, 27)
- <9, 26, 4, 24> with chord (4, 10)
- <9, 26, 21, 1> with chord (21, 3)
- and more...

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found. 

There are [12] chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
