Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 6) (15, 0) (15, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 2) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 2) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 7) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 7) (5, 13) (5, 16) (19, 4) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 10) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 11) (7, 17) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 15) (12, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 0-15-12-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-15-12-6-18-9-14-0
- Cycle 3: 0-15-12-6-18-9-16-5-0
- Cycle 4: 0-15-12-6-18-9-10-1-17-7-11-4-0
- Cycle 5: 0-15-12-6-18-9-10-1-17-7-11-4-2-13-5-0
- Cycle 6: 0-15-12-6-18-9-10-1-17-7-11-8-13-5-0
- Cycle 7: 0-15-12-6-18-9-16-5-13-8-11-4-0
- Cycle 8: 0-14-9-18-6-12-15-0
- Cycle 9: 0-14-9-18-6-12-15-12-6-3-11-4-0
- Cycle 10: 0-14-9-18-6-12-15-12-6-3-11-7-17-1-10-9-16-5-13-8-4-0
- Cycle 11: 0-14-9-18-6-12-15-12-6-3-11-7-17-1-10-9-16-5-13-2-4-0
- Cycle 12: 0-14-9-16-5-13-8-11-4-0
- Cycle 13: 0-14-9-16-5-13-2-4-11-7-17-1-10-9-18-6-12-15-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (15, 12), 6, 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (14, 9), 16, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (15, 12), 6, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, (14, 9), 18, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (15, 12), 6, 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <0, (14, 9), 16, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <0, (15, 12), 6, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <0, (14, 9), 18, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph, so the final count is [8].
