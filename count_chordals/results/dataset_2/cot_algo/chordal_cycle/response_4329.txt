Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 12) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 11, 1, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 0, 8, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 9, 3, 1, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 4, 9, 3, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 0, 8, 11, 7)
- Cycle 6: (1, 3, 9, 2, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 6, 8, 11, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 11, 7, 4, 1)
- Cycle 9: (3, 1, 6, 8, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 9, 2, 5, 3)
- Cycle 11: (8, 2, 13, 10, 8)
- Cycle 12: (13, 12, 0, 8, 13)
- Cycle 13: (13, 2, 1, 3, 13)
- Cycle 14: (2, 5, 14, 3, 2)
- Cycle 15: (5, 2, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 16: (0, 4, 9, 12, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1: <1, (7, 1), 4>
- Cycle 2: <2, (0, 8), 4>
- Cycle 3: <3, (9, 1), 4>
- Cycle 4: <5, (3, 7), 4>
- Cycle 5: <6, (11, 7), 4>
- Cycle 6: <7, (1, 9), 4>
- Cycle 7: <8, (3, 1), 4>
- Cycle 8: <9, (2, 3), 4>
- Cycle 9: <10, (8, 13), 3>
- Cycle 10: <11, (13, 3), 9>
- Cycle 11: <12, (2, 5), 13>
- Cycle 12: <13, (12, 0), 8>
- Cycle 13: <14, (1, 2), 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [13]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (7, 1), 4>
<2, (0, 8), 4>
<3, (9, 1), 4>
<5, (3, 7), 4>
<6, (11, 7), 4>
<7, (1, 9), 4>
<8, (3, 1), 4>
<9, (2, 3), 4>
<10, (8, 13), 3>
<11, (13, 3), 9>
<12, (2, 5), 13>
<13, (12, 0), 8>
<14, (1, 2), 13>
