Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 7) (6, 14) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 14) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 10) (19, 5) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 4) (16, 17) (16, 15) (16, 7) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 16) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 1) (3, 17) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 15) (1, 12) (1, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 2-6-14-11-2
- Cycle 2: 2-6-9-18-2
- Cycle 3: 2-6-19-10-4-2
- Cycle 4: 2-6-19-5-7-16-15-4-2
- Cycle 5: 16-15-4-10-12-2-6-19-16
- Cycle 6: 16-17-7-5-19-6-9-18-16
- Cycle 7: 16-17-10-4-15-16
- Cycle 8: 16-7-5-19-6-9-18-13-16
- Cycle 9: 16-7-17-3-12-2-6-19-16
- Cycle 10: 15-16-7-5-19-10-12-3-15
- Cycle 11: 4-15-16-7-5-19-6-9-18-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 5 has one chord 12-3
- Cycle 6 has one chord 13-18
- Cycle 7 has one chord 12-2

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, thus the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <2, 6, 19, 10>, chord: (4-2)
- <16, 17, 7, 5>, chord: (13-18)
- <15, 16, 7, 5>, chord: (12-2)
