Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:  
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:  
  1. Cycle <0, 1, 4, 2>  
  2. Cycle <0, 1, 7, 9>  
  3. Cycle <1, 3, 9, 8>  
  4. Cycle <1, 4, 6, 5>  
  5. Cycle <2, 4, 6, 1>  
  6. Cycle <3, 5, 2, 6>  
  7. Cycle <3, 5, 0, 1>  
  8. Cycle <3, 8, 9, 7>  
  9. Cycle <4, 6, 5, 2>  
  10. Cycle <4, 6, 1, 0>  
  11. Cycle <5, 6, 2, 4>  
  12. Cycle <5, 6, 1, 4>  
  13. Cycle <6, 1, 0, 4>  
  14. Cycle <8, 9, 7, 1>  
  15. Cycle <8, 9, 3, 1>  

Step 2:  
- Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:  
  1. Cycle <0, 1, 7, 9> with chord (0, 9)  
  2. Cycle <1, 3, 9, 8> with chord (1, 9)  
  3. Cycle <1, 4, 6, 5> with chord (1, 6)  
  4. Cycle <4, 6, 1, 0> with chord (4, 1)  

Step 3:  
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:  
  [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:  
- <0, 1, 7, 9>  
- <1, 3, 9, 8>  
- <1, 4, 6, 5>  
- <4, 6, 1, 0>
