Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 8) (15, 19) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) (8, 7) (8, 12) (3, 9) (3, 18) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: <11, 16, 6, 4, 11>
        - Cycle 2: <9, 14, 7, 0, 9>
        - Cycle 3: <4, 6, 9, 1, 4>
        - Cycle 4: <18, 3, 9, 1, 18>
        - Cycle 5: <19, 15, 7, 0, 19>
        - Cycle 6: <5, 11, 16, 13, 5>
        - Cycle 7: <2, 12, 14, 2>
        - Cycle 8: <17, 0, 7, 19, 17>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord: (6, 11) -> <11, (6, 11), 16, 4>
        - Cycle 2 has a chord: (14, 0) -> <9, (14, 0), 7, 9>
        - Cycle 3 is chordal: <4, 6, 9, 1, 4>
        - Cycle 4 is chordal: <18, 3, 9, 1, 18>
        - Cycle 5 is chordal: <19, 15, 7, 0, 19>
        - Cycle 6 has a chord: (13, 16) -> <5, 11, (13, 16), 5>
        - Cycle 7 has a chord: (12, 2) -> <2, (12, 2), 14, 12>
        - Cycle 8 is chordal: <17, 0, 7, 19, 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        - There are 3 chordless cycles found: <4, 6, 9, 1>, <18, 3, 9, 1, 18>, <19, 15, 7, 0, 19>
        
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
