Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <4, 7, (2, 6), 14>
2. <4, 7, (14, 2), 13>
3. <4, 7, (14, 13), 3>
4. <4, 11, (12, 0), 8>
5. <7, 4, (11, 12), 2>
6. <7, 2, (12, 0), 14>
7. <7, 14, (13, 3), 2>
8. <1, 6, (7, 14), 2>
9. <1, 9, (0, 5), 6>
10. <3, 13, (14, 7), 10>
11. <3, 12, (0, 9), 5>
12. <5, 3, (12, 0), 10>
13. <10, 13, (14, 7), 9>
14. <10, 9, (0, 2), 5>
15. <11, 4, (8, 12), 0>
16. <11, 12, (2, 7), 8>
17. <6, 7, (14, 13), 1>
18. <0, 11, (12, 2), 5>
19. <0, 5, (12, 2), 3>
20. <2, 7, (6, 1), 14>
21. <2, 7, (14, 13), 6>
22. <2, 6, (1, 9), 7>
23. <2, 0, (12, 11), 5>
24. <2, 12, (5, 0), 3>
25. <12, 3, (5, 0), 12>
26. <9, 4, (11, 0), 1>
27. <9, 1, (6, 7), 4>
28. <9, 10, (13, 14), 5>
29. <5, 3, (13, 10), 0>
30. <13, 14, (7, 4), 13>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [30].
