Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- (5, 4, 3, 9)
- (5, 3, 7, 4)
- (9, 3, 4, 7)
- (9, 6, 1, 8)
- (4, 7, 8, 0)
- (4, 3, 2, 0)
- (7, 8, 1, 6)
- (7, 4, 2, 0)
- (6, 9, 0, 7)
- (8, 7, 0, 2)
- (2, 4, 3, 0)
- (2, 0, 1, 6)
- (0, 9, 6, 1)
- (0, 7, 8, 1)
- (0, 2, 1, 6)

Step 2: 
- <5, 3, 7, 4> (5, 7)
- <9, 6, 1, 8> (9, 1)
- <4, 7, 8, 0> (4, 8)
- <7, 8, 1, 6> (7, 1)
- <6, 9, 0, 7> (6, 0)
- <8, 7, 0, 2> (8, 0)
- <2, 4, 3, 0> (2, 3)
- <0, 9, 6, 1> (0, 6)

Step 3:
