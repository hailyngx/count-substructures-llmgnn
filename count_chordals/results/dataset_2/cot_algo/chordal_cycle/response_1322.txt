Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 10) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 12) (13, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 17) (0, 12) (0, 2) (16, 7) (16, 18) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 9) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 14) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 17) (17, 3) (17, 11) (17, 2) (19, 11) (19, 10) (15, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 12) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 10) (14, 18) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles with length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-11-6-4-10-3
- Cycle 2: 1-3-11-7-16-18-5-8-1

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 11), 6, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (3, 11), 7, 16>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
