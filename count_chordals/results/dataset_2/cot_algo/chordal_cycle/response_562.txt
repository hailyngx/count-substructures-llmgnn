Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-14-13-2-6-5
        - Cycle 2: 5-9-3-4-5
        - Cycle 3: 5-4-12-6-5
        - Cycle 4: 5-7-1-8-5
        - Cycle 5: 5-4-3-13-5
        - Cycle 6: 5-7-10-2-6-5
        - Cycle 7: 5-9-1-7-5
        - Cycle 8: 4-12-0-6-4
        - Cycle 9: 4-3-13-14-4
        - Cycle 10: 4-7-10-2-4
        - Cycle 11: 4-3-9-1-4
        - Cycle 12: 7-1-8-10-7
        - Cycle 13: 7-10-2-13-7
        - Cycle 14: 2-6-12-0-2
        - Cycle 15: 2-10-14-13-2
        - Cycle 16: 2-6-5-4-2
        - Cycle 17: 2-10-7-5-2
        - Cycle 18: 8-1-7-10-8
        - Cycle 19: 13-14-11-4-13
        - Cycle 20: 13-3-4-11-13

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Chordal cycle 1: <5, (9, 3), 4>
        - Chordal cycle 2: <5, (4, 12), 6>
        - Chordal cycle 3: <5, (7, 1), 8>
        - Chordal cycle 4: <4, (12, 6), 0>
        - Chordal cycle 5: <4, (3, 13), 14>
        - Chordal cycle 6: <5, (4, 3), 13>
        - Chordal cycle 7: <7, (1, 8), 10>
        - Chordal cycle 8: <2, (6, 12), 0>
        - Chordal cycle 9: <2, (10, 7), 5>
        - Chordal cycle 10: <13, (14, 11), 4>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final number inside brackets is [10].
