Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 20) (22, 29) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 21) (9, 13) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 17) (9, 16) (15, 14) (27, 12) (27, 8) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 10) (21, 5) (21, 7) (21, 19) (21, 11) (21, 14) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 12) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 23) (17, 10) (17, 1) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (8, 27) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 25) (12, 27) (12, 23) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 26) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 18) (18, 4) (18, 14) (1, 17) (1, 24) (24, 1) (24, 26) (26, 5) (26, 0) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 25) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 25) (6, 10) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 21) (11, 2) (3, 20) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 26) (28, 9) (28, 19) (20, 22) (20, 3) (25, 23) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 2) (19, 7) (19, 21) (19, 28) (16, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- (5, 9, 13, 14)
- (5, 26, 0, 4)
- (7, 10, 6, 2)
- (7, 11, 2, 25)
- (7, 21, 5, 26)
- (8, 25, 2, 6)
- (9, 13, 22, 20)
- (9, 17, 13, 22)
- (9, 17, 23, 12)
- (9, 28, 19, 7)
- (11, 2, 6, 10)
- (11, 21, 5, 26)
- (12, 23, 17, 10)
- (13, 14, 15, 21)
- (13, 17, 23, 12)
- (14, 18, 4, 0)
- (17, 1, 24, 26)
- (17, 9, 13, 22)
- (17, 23, 12, 0)
- (18, 14, 15, 21)
- (19, 7, 11, 2)
- (19, 21, 5, 26)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle, we find that only one cycle has a chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle is <13, (9, 22), 17>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is therefore [1].
