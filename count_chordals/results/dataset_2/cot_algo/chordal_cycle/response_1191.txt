Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 12) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (3, 25) (3, 0) (15, 5) (15, 0) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 18) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 20) (18, 5) (18, 25) (18, 2) (18, 14) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 19) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 14) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 10) (11, 28) (11, 8) (28, 22) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 7) (4, 25) (4, 27) (4, 13) (4, 17) (27, 9) (27, 25) (27, 4) (16, 2) (16, 28) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 24) (21, 0) (21, 13) (23, 26) (23, 6) (19, 0) (19, 22) (19, 7) (19, 14) (24, 29) (24, 8) (7, 28) (7, 19) (7, 1) (17, 4) (13, 4) (13, 21) (6, 22) (6, 23) (1, 20) (1, 7) (8, 11) (8, 24) (8, 10) (14, 18) (14, 20) (14, 19) (10, 5) (10, 22) (10, 8) (12, 26) (12, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (9, 26, 23, 6, 22, 19, 0, 3, 25, 4, 27, 9)
- Cycle 2: (10, 5, 18, 25, 27, 4, 13, 21, 0, 15, 5, 10)
- Cycle 3: (11, 28, 16, 2, 18, 5, 9, 26, 29, 24, 8, 11)
- Cycle 4: (12, 26, 29, 24, 8, 10, 22, 6, 23, 26, 12)
- Cycle 5: (14, 18, 25, 4, 27, 9, 5, 18, 2, 16, 28, 7, 19, 14)
- Cycle 6: (20, 2, 18, 14, 19, 7, 1, 20)
- Cycle 7: (21, 0, 3, 25, 18, 2, 20, 14, 19, 22, 6, 23, 26, 29, 24, 8, 11, 28, 16, 3, 0, 21)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (8, 10), 11, 28>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (5, 27), 9, 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (2, 18), 5, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (8, 24), 26, 29>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (7, 19), 14, 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (1, 20), 2, 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (6, 22), 23, 26>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
