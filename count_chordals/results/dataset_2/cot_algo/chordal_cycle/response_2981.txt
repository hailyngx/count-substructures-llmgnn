Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 12) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 14) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (12, 0) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 7) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 4)

 - Cycles of length 5 or more: (There are no such cycles in the given graph)

Step 2:
 - Chordal 4-cycles: <6, 9, 14, 7> with chord (13, 4)

Step 3:
 - Number of chordless cycles found: [0]
