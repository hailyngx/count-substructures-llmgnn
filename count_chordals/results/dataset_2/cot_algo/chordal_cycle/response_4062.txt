Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 24) (14, 1) (14, 4) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 15) (17, 26) (7, 20) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 26) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 19) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 29) (0, 11) (0, 5) (20, 7) (20, 9) (20, 23) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 13) (24, 21) (24, 26) (24, 16) (26, 17) (26, 12) (26, 24) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 23) (5, 0) (29, 27) (29, 10) (29, 18) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (19, 1) (19, 27) (15, 17) (15, 18) (9, 17) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 28) (28, 9) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 23) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 29) (18, 15) (18, 13) (25, 16) (25, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 25) (4, 14) (4, 28) (4, 23) (23, 20) (23, 16) (23, 28) (23, 4) (23, 13) (22, 10) (22, 28) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 21, 12, 27)
- (1, 21, 24, 16)
- (1, 14, 4, 28)
- (17, 10, 3, 11)
- (17, 10, 29, 18)
- (17, 9, 2, 6)
- (17, 15, 18, 13)
- (12, 21, 24, 16)
- (12, 27, 29, 18)
- (27, 12, 21, 24)
- (27, 12, 26, 24)
- (27, 29, 18, 13)
- (10, 17, 15, 18)
- (10, 17, 26, 24)
- (10, 18, 13, 23)
- (3, 10, 17, 15)
- (3, 11, 18, 13)
- (11, 3, 10, 17)
- (11, 13, 23, 20)
- (24, 21, 12, 27)
- (24, 21, 12, 26)
- (24, 26, 17, 15)
- (26, 17, 10, 18)
- (26, 24, 16, 23)
- (16, 24, 21, 12)
- (16, 25, 6, 3)
- (16, 23, 20, 7)
- (29, 27, 12, 21)
- (29, 10, 17, 15)
- (29, 18, 13, 23)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (21, 12), 27>
- <1, (21, 24), 16>
- <1, (14, 4), 28>
- <17, (10, 3), 11>
- <17, (10, 29), 18>
- <17, (9, 2), 6>
- <17, (15, 18), 13>
- <12, (21, 24), 16>
- <12, (27, 29), 18>
- <27, (12, 26), 24>
- <10, (17, 15), 18>
- <10, (17, 26), 24>
- <10, (18, 13), 23>
- <3, (10, 17), 15>
- <3, (11, 18), 13>
- <11, (3, 10), 17>
- <11, (13, 23), 20>
- <24, (21, 12), 27>
- <24, (21, 12), 26>
- <24, (26, 16), 23>
- <26, (17, 10), 18>
- <16, (24, 21), 12>
- <16, (25, 6), 3>
- <16, (23, 20), 7>
- <29, (27, 12), 21>
- <29, (10, 17), 15>
- <29, (18, 13), 23>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [27].
