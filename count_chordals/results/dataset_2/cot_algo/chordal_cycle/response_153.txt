Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 7, 4> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 6> 
- Cycle 3: <1, 2, 8, 4> 
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 5, 9> 
- Cycle 5: <2, 4, 8, 3> 
- Cycle 6: <3, 4, 7, 0> 

Step 2:
- Checking for a single chord in each cycle:
    - <0, 3, 7, 4> has a chord between 3 and 7.
    - <0, 5, 8, 6> has a chord between 5 and 8.
    - <1, 2, 8, 4> has a chord between 1 and 8.
    - <1, 2, 5, 9> has a chord between 2 and 5.
    - <2, 4, 8, 3> has a chord between 2 and 8.
    - <3, 4, 7, 0> has a chord between 3 and 7.

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are as follows: 
- <0, (3, 7), 4> 
- <0, (5, 8), 6> 
- <1, (2, 8), 4> 
- <1, (2, 5), 9> 
- <2, (4, 8), 3> 
- <3, (4, 7), 0>
