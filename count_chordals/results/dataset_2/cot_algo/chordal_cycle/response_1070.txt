Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 15) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 15) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (0, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 19) (17, 8) (17, 11) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 16) (10, 14) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 11) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 16) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 19) (11, 13) (11, 17) (11, 15) (11, 19) (5, 7) (5, 12) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
1. Cycle 2-18-15-12
2. Cycle 3-6-14-2
3. Cycle 3-7-16-2
4. Cycle 4-8-9-1
5. Cycle 4-10-2-13
6. Cycle 5-7-16-10
7. Cycle 5-12-15-19
8. Cycle 8-9-13-11
9. Cycle 8-4-10-16
10. Cycle 10-14-6-3
11. Cycle 11-13-9-1
12. Cycle 11-15-12-5
13. Cycle 15-18-2-14

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle 2-18-15-12 has one chord: (18, 12) = <2, (18, 12), 15>
2. Cycle 3-6-14-2 has one chord: (6, 14) = <3, (6, 14), 2>
3. Cycle 3-7-16-2 has one chord: (7, 16) = <3, (7, 16), 2>
4. Cycle 8-9-13-11 has one chord: (9, 11) = <8, (9, 11), 13>
5. Cycle 8-4-10-16 has one chord: (4, 16) = <8, (4, 16), 10>
6. Cycle 15-18-2-14 has one chord: (18, 14) = <15, (18, 14), 2>

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final count is [6].
