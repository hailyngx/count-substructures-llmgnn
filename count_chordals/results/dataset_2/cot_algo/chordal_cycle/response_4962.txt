Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 21) (11, 17) (16, 29) (10, 11) (10, 27) (10, 13) (10, 9) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 3) (20, 22) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 7) (23, 24) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 21) (21, 11) (21, 12) (21, 28) (28, 20) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 19) (28, 15) (4, 9) (4, 13) (27, 10) (27, 29) (27, 13) (1, 20) (1, 9) (15, 28) (15, 22) (3, 20) (3, 7) (3, 28) (3, 0) (26, 29) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 1) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 5) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 13) (22, 20) (22, 15) (22, 14) (22, 17) (17, 11) (17, 8) (17, 22) (29, 16) (29, 27) (29, 26) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (24, 23) (24, 0) (19, 25) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 14) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 27) (13, 14) (6, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (10, 11), (11, 21), (21, 12), (12, 2), (2, 18), (18, 9), (9, 10)
- Cycle 2: (20, 25), (25, 9), (9, 18), (18, 2), (2, 12), (12, 21), (21, 28), (28, 20)
- Cycle 3: (7, 8), (8, 17), (17, 22), (22, 14), (14, 13), (13, 4), (4, 9), (9, 7)
- Cycle 4: (3, 20), (20, 22), (22, 14), (14, 19), (19, 2), (2, 7), (7, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (21, 12)
- Cycle 2 has 2 chords: (25, 9) and (21, 28)

Therefore, no chordal 4-cycle is found in this graph.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. Since no chordal 4-cycle is found, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
