Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 2) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 4) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 29) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 8) (27, 0) (27, 7) (27, 1) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 25) (28, 3) (28, 29) (28, 9) (29, 15) (29, 28) (29, 25) (20, 17) (20, 26) (21, 0) (1, 15) (1, 27) (1, 23) (1, 19) (17, 20) (17, 2) (17, 7) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 9) (24, 19) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 4) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 7) (19, 1) (19, 24) (2, 13) (2, 22) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 16) (14, 18) (14, 9) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 6) (11, 5) (11, 6) (4, 22) (4, 26) (4, 23) (4, 16) (12, 24) (12, 10) (16, 2) (16, 4) (9, 28) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 25) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (23, 1) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 10) (6, 7) (6, 11) (10, 12) (10, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <2, 3, 15, 1, 2>
- Cycle 2: <2, 17, 7, 0, 2>
- Cycle 3: <2, 17, 7, 18, 2>
- Cycle 4: <2, 3, 15, 29, 25, 2>
- Cycle 5: <2, 17, 7, 18, 23, 4, 26, 24, 9, 14, 18, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 17, 7, 18, 23, 10, 12, 24, 26, 4, 16, 2>
- Cycle 7: <2, 17, 7, 0, 27, 1, 19, 24, 26, 20, 17, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 3, 15, 29, 25, 8, 13, 22, 4, 26, 24, 9, 28, 3, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <2, 3, 15, 1, 2> has chord (3, 15)
- Cycle 2: <2, 17, 7, 0, 2> has chord (7, 0)
- Cycle 3: <2, 17, 7, 18, 2> has chord (7, 18)
- Cycle 4: <2, 3, 15, 29, 25, 2> has chord (15, 25)
- Cycle 5: <2, 17, 7, 18, 23, 4, 26, 24, 9, 14, 18, 2> has chord (4, 24)
- Cycle 6: <2, 17, 7, 18, 23, 10, 12, 24, 26, 4, 16, 2> has chord (10, 16)
- Cycle 7: <2, 17, 7, 18, 23, 4, 26, 24, 9, 14, 18, 2> has chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 8: <2, 3, 15, 29, 25, 8, 13, 22, 4, 26, 24, 9, 28, 3, 2> has chord (8, 22)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <2, 3, 15, 1, 2>
- <2, 17, 7, 0, 2>
- <2, 17, 7, 18, 2>
- <2, 3, 15, 29, 25, 2>
- <2, 17, 7, 18, 23, 4, 26, 24, 9, 14, 18, 2>
- <2, 17, 7, 18, 23, 10, 12, 24, 26, 4, 16, 2>
- <2, 3, 15, 29, 25, 8, 13, 22, 4, 26, 24, 9, 28, 3, 2>
