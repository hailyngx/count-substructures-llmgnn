- Chordal cycle 3: 4-11-13-5-4 has chord (11, 5) ✅
- Chordal cycle 6: 10-20-1-19-10 has chord (20, 1) ✅
- Chordal cycle 7: 13-11-4-12-13 has chord (11, 12) ✅
- Chordal cycle 8: 13-2-24-14-13 has chord (2, 14) ✅
- Chordal cycle 9: 13-5-19-10-13 has chord (5, 10) ✅
- Chordal cycle 10: 19-1-23-27-19 has chord (1, 27) ✅
- Chordal cycle 12: 19-10-21-14-19 has chord (10, 21) ✅
- Chordal cycle 13: 20-1-23-27-20 has chord (1, 27) ✅
- Chordal cycle 15: 24-6-17-3-24 has chord (6, 3) ✅
- Chordal cycle 16: 27-12-28-22-27 has chord (12, 22) ✅
- Chordal cycle 17: 27-24-14-4-27 has chord (24, 4) ✅

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal cycles found:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [11].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, (9, 2), 26>
<4, (11, 5), 13>
<10, (20, 1), 19>
<13, (11, 12), 4>
<13, (2, 14), 24>
<13, (5, 10), 19>
<19, (1, 27), 23>
<19, (10, 21), 14>
<20, (1, 27), 23>
<24, (6, 3), 17>
<27, (12, 22), 28>
