Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 11) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <0, 5, 11, 6, 2, 0>
        - <0, 5, 7, 3, 10, 4, 6, 2, 0>
        - <0, 5, 7, 3, 12, 6, 2, 0>
        - <1, 2, 6, 4, 9, 1>
        - <1, 2, 6, 4, 10, 3, 7, 9, 1>
        - <1, 2, 6, 4, 14, 7, 9, 1>
        - <1, 2, 6, 12, 3, 7, 9, 1>
        - <1, 2, 0, 5, 7, 3, 10, 4, 9, 1>
        - <3, 7, 9, 4, 6, 12, 3>
        - <3, 7, 9, 4, 14, 12, 3>
        - <3, 7, 9, 14, 4, 6, 12, 3>
        - <3, 7, 0, 5, 11, 6, 12, 3>
        - <4, 6, 12, 14, 9, 4>
        - <5, 7, 9, 11, 6, 12, 5>
        - <6, 2, 0, 5, 11, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0, 5, 11, 6, 2, 0>  (Chord: 5-6)
        - <0, 5, 7, 3, 10, 4, 6, 2, 0>  (Chord: 7-4)
        - <0, 5, 7, 3, 12, 6, 2, 0>  (Chord: 5-12)
        - <1, 2, 6, 4, 10, 3, 7, 9, 1>  (Chord: 4-7)
        - <1, 2, 6, 4, 14, 7, 9, 1>  (Chord: 4-9)
        - <1, 2, 6, 12, 3, 7, 9, 1>  (Chord: 2-7)
        - <1, 2, 0, 5, 7, 3, 10, 4, 9, 1>  (Chord: 1-9)
        - <3, 7, 9, 4, 6, 12, 3>  (Chord: 9-6)
        - <3, 7, 9, 4, 14, 12, 3>  (Chord: 7-12)
        - <3, 7, 9, 14, 4, 6, 12, 3>  (Chord: 4-6)
        - <3, 7, 0, 5, 11, 6, 12, 3>  (Chord: 3-11)
        - <4, 6, 12, 14, 9, 4>  (Chord: 6-9)
        - <5, 7, 9, 11, 6, 12, 5>  (Chord: 7-11)
        - <6, 2, 0, 5, 11, 6>  (Chord: 2-5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 14 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [14].
