Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 15) (16, 4) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 5) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 4) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 13) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 8) (10, 4) (8, 6) (8, 10) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 12) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 11 - 15 - 3 - 9 - 6 - 8 - 10 - 4 - 16 - 14 - 19 - 17 - 2 - 5 - 13 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 2: 3 - 15 - 13 - 5 - 2 - 9 - 3
- Cycle 3: 4 - 16 - 14 - 5 - 13 - 10 - 4
- Cycle 4: 7 - 0 - 1 - 4 - 10 - 8 - 6 - 9 - 7
- Cycle 5: 9 - 3 - 15 - 13 - 7 - 0 - 19 - 12 - 9
- Cycle 6: 12 - 19 - 0 - 1 - 4 - 12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has the chord <3, 15>.
- Cycle 5 has the chord <4, 12>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are <0, 1, 11, 15> and <3, 15, 13, 5> and the total number of chordal 4-cycles is [2].
