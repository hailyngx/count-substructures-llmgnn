Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 20) (21, 11) (21, 18) (21, 25) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 26) (15, 3) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (22, 23) (22, 12) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 2) (23, 29) (2, 23) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 28) (29, 23) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 19) (20, 21) (20, 25) (20, 26) (25, 21) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 18) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 15) (17, 13) (27, 1) (27, 29) (27, 25) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 10) (26, 3) (26, 20) (26, 10) (12, 4) (12, 22) (12, 24) (12, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 26) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 16) (11, 21) (11, 8) (19, 1) (19, 29) (14, 3) (14, 4) (0, 6) (0, 28) (0, 18) (28, 2) (28, 0) (8, 22) (8, 6) (8, 11) (24, 5) (24, 12) (18, 21) (18, 25) (18, 0) (16, 6) (16, 9) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-21-20-25-1
- Cycle 2: 27-29-2-23-27
- Cycle 3: 4-7-22-12-4
- Cycle 4: 3-15-17-13-3
- Cycle 5: 5-2-28-0-5
- Cycle 6: 10-26-20-21-11-8-22-12-24-5-10
- Cycle 7: 6-8-11-21-18-25-20-26-10-3-14-4-13-17-15-3
- Cycle 8: 9-13-17-15-3-26-10-5-24-12-22-8-6-16-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Only Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (10, 21)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 7 chordless cycles: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8

Therefore, the final number is [7].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <10, 21, (11, 1), 8>.
