Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 6) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 6) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- We will list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
  1. Cycle 1: (5, 9, 11, 3, 1, 13, 7, 4, 5)
  2. Cycle 2: (5, 12, 11, 3, 0, 6, 13, 10, 13, 9, 11, 12)
  3. Cycle 3: (2, 5, 12, 11, 6, 14, 3, 0, 4, 7, 13, 1, 2)

Step 2:
- We will check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
  1. <1, (9, 11), 13> has one chord (9, 11)
  2. <2, (5, 12), 11> has one chord (5, 12)
  3. <3, (2, 6), 13> has one chord (2, 6)

Step 3:
- As we found 3 unique chordal 4-cycles, the final count will be [3].
