Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 6) (2, 0) (2, 11) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 13) (7, 16) (7, 8) (12, 5) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 17) (8, 7) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 5) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 13) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 15) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (17, 0) (17, 4) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 1)

        - Cycle 25: <6, 10, 13, 1>
        - Cycle 26: <6, 16, 7, 8>
        - Cycle 27: <6, 16, 4, 17>
        - Cycle 28: <6, 19, 8, 4>
        - Cycle 29: <6, 19, 8, 1>

        - Cycle 31: <7, 8, 19, 6>
        - Cycle 32: <7, 8, 19, 15>
        - Cycle 33: <8, 4, 17, 0>
        - Cycle 34: <8, 4, 13, 18>
        - Cycle 35: <8, 14, 5, 18>
        - Cycle 36: <9, 6, 19, 15>
        - Cycle 37: <10, 15, 18, 13>
        - Cycle 38: <10, 13, 1, 8>
        - Cycle 39: <13, 18, 15, 19>

        - Cycle 42: <15, 0, 2, 11>
        - Cycle 43: <15, 0, 17, 4>
        - Cycle 44: <15, 10, 13, 1>
        - Cycle 45: <15, 19, 6, 9>
        - Cycle 46: <17, 0, 2, 11>
        - Cycle 47: <18, 5, 14, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 2, (11), 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 2, (11), 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 15, (19), 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 15, (19), 8>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, 17, (4), 13>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, 14, (8), 19>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, 9, (15), 18>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, 9, (13), 1>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <6, 19, (8), 1>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <7, 16, (4), 17>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <8, 4, (13), 18>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <13, 18, (15), 19>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <15, 19, (6), 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 14: <17, 0, (2), 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are 47 cycles in total, and 14 unique chordal 4-cycles were found.

Therefore, the final count is [14].
