Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
        - Cycle 2: (1, 7, 2, 4, 1)
        - Cycle 3: (1, 4, 6, 7, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (1, 4, 0, 3, 1)
        - Cycle 5: (3, 0, 2, 7, 3)
        - Cycle 6: (3, 0, 4, 6, 3)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 1, 4, 6, 3)
        - Cycle 8: (1, 7, 6, 8, 1)
        - Cycle 9: (1, 7, 9, 8, 1)
        - Cycle 10: (7, 6, 8, 9, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1 has no chord.
        - Cycle 2 has chord (1, 2).
        - Cycle 3 has no chord.
        - Cycle 4 has no chord.
        - Cycle 5 has chord (0, 2).
        - Cycle 6 has chord (0, 4).
        - Cycle 7 has chord (1, 4).
        - Cycle 8 has chord (6, 8).
        - Cycle 9 has chord (7, 8).
        - Cycle 10 has chord (6, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 3 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <1, 2, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 6, 7>
