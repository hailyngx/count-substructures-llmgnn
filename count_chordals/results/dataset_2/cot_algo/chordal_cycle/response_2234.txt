Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 13) (10, 0) (10, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:

- Cycle 41: 2-7-8-5-2
- Cycle 42: 2-12-14-13-2
- Cycle 43: 13-9-7-2-13
- Cycle 44: 13-1-5-8-13

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
- <1, (5, 9), 13>
- <2, (4, 12), 13>
- <8, (5, 1), 13>

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
