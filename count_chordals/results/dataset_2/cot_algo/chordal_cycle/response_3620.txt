Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 9) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 5, 4, 12, 13, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 13, 12, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 13, 12, 14, 11, 3, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 6: (3, 5, 4, 12, 13, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 5, 4, 12, 10, 8, 1, 3)
- Cycle 8: (5, 6, 0, 11, 3, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 7, 8, 1, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 4, 5)
- Cycle 11: (5, 2, 3, 13, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 2, 3, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 13: (6, 4, 12, 13, 6)
- Cycle 14: (6, 4, 12, 10, 8, 1, 6)
- Cycle 15: (8, 1, 6, 5, 7, 8)
- Cycle 16: (8, 10, 12, 13, 8)
- Cycle 17: (13, 4, 1, 3, 13)
- Cycle 18: (13, 4, 1, 6, 5, 13)
- Cycle 19: (13, 4, 12, 10, 8, 1, 13)
- Cycle 20: (11, 3, 1, 6, 0, 11)
- Cycle 21: (11, 0, 6, 5, 7, 11)
- Cycle 22: (4, 12, 10, 8, 4)
- Cycle 23: (12, 9, 14, 10, 12)
- Cycle 24: (0, 6, 1, 3, 0)
- Cycle 25: (10, 12, 9, 3, 10)
- Cycle 26: (14, 1, 6, 5, 14)
- Cycle 27: (7, 8, 10, 12, 7)
- Cycle 28: (9, 12, 13, 3, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <1, 4, (5, 12), 13>
- <8, 10, (12, 1), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [26] chordless cycles in the given graph.
