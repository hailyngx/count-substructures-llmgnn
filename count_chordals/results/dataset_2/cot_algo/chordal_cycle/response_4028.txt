Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 13) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 18) (8, 19) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 15) (13, 10) (13, 17) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 12) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 18) (16, 2) (6, 10) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 14) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 17) (18, 16) (18, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 16, 0, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 18, 17, 10, 6, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 7, 11, 4, 17, 15, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 5, 12, 19, 16, 3, 1, 18, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 5, 11, 7, 9, 14, 0, 16, 2)
- Cycle 6: (3, 16, 19, 12, 5, 11, 7, 2, 3)
- Cycle 7: (4, 11, 7, 9, 0, 14, 15, 17, 4)
- Cycle 8: (6, 10, 17, 15, 0, 16, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 9: (7, 11, 5, 12, 19, 16, 2, 7)
- Cycle 10: (9, 14, 0, 16, 3, 1, 18, 17, 9)
- Cycle 11: (10, 17, 15, 0, 14, 9, 7, 11, 10)
- Cycle 12: (12, 19, 16, 0, 14, 15, 17, 18, 12)
- Cycle 13: (1, 3, 16, 2, 7, 11, 4, 17, 1)
- Cycle 14: (1, 18, 17, 15, 0, 16, 3, 1)
- Cycle 15: (2, 7, 11, 5, 12, 19, 16, 2)
- Cycle 16: (4, 11, 5, 12, 19, 16, 3, 1, 4)
- Cycle 17: (6, 10, 17, 18, 12, 19, 16, 3, 6)
- Cycle 18: (7, 9, 14, 0, 16, 2, 5, 11, 7)
- Cycle 19: (7, 11, 2, 16, 3, 1, 18, 17, 7)
- Cycle 20: (10, 17, 18, 12, 5, 11, 7, 2, 10)

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <1, 3, 16, 0>
- <1, 18, 17, 10>
- <2, 7, 11, 4>
- <2, 5, 12, 19>
- <2, 5, 11, 7>
- <3, 16, 19, 12>
- <4, 11, 7, 9>
- <6, 10, 17, 15>
- <7, 11, 5, 12>
- <9, 14, 0, 16>

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
