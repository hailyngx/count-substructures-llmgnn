Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 0, 5)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 9, 2)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 2, 6)
- Cycle 5: (4, 9, 0, 1)
- Cycle 6: (7, 0, 1, 5)
- Cycle 7: (7, 0, 5, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 0, 6, 2)
- Cycle 9: (7, 9, 2, 6)
- Cycle 10: (0, 1, 5, 4)
- Cycle 11: (0, 1, 5, 9)
- Cycle 12: (0, 5, 4, 6)
- Cycle 13: (0, 5, 1, 9)
- Cycle 14: (9, 2, 6, 7)
- Cycle 15: (6, 2, 9, 7)
- Cycle 16: (6, 2, 3, 8)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The chordal 4-cycle is <4, 7, 0, 1> with a chord (0, 1)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
