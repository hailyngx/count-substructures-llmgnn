Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 2) (5, 19) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 19) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 18) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 16) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (12, 7) (12, 9) (13, 14) (13, 11) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 11) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 11) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 14) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 2) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Two cycles of length 4 are: 
    - Cycle 1: 4-7-12-9-4
    - Cycle 2: 16-2-3-1-16

Step 2:
- Cycle 1 (4-7-12-9-4) has exactly one chord (7,9).
- Cycle 2 (16-2-3-1-16) has exactly one chord (2,1).

Step 3:
Since both cycles found have exactly one chord each, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (7, 9), 4>
- <2, (2, 1), 16>
