Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 4-8-5-2-4
- Cycle 2: 4-8-7-1-4
- Cycle 3: 4-8-1-6-4
- Cycle 4: 4-9-0-6-4
- Cycle 5: 4-9-2-1-4
- Cycle 6: 4-9-3-8-4
- Cycle 7: 8-7-1-6-8
- Cycle 8: 8-7-1-2-8
- Cycle 9: 8-7-1-4-8
- Cycle 10: 8-9-3-4-8
- Cycle 11: 8-9-0-4-8
- Cycle 12: 8-9-0-6-8
- Cycle 13: 5-2-6-0-5
- Cycle 14: 5-2-1-7-5
- Cycle 15: 5-4-9-3-5
- Cycle 16: 5-4-9-0-5

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (4, 8), 5>
- Chordal cycle 2: <2, (4, 8), 5>
- Chordal cycle 3: <3, (4, 9), 2>
- Chordal cycle 4: <4, (8, 7), 1>
- Chordal cycle 5: <5, (8, 7), 1>
- Chordal cycle 6: <6, (8, 7), 1>
- Chordal cycle 7: <7, (8, 7), 1>
- Chordal cycle 8: <8, (8, 9), 4>
- Chordal cycle 9: <9, (8, 9), 0>
- Chordal cycle 10: <10, (5, 2), 6>
- Chordal cycle 11: <11, (5, 2), 1>
- Chordal cycle 12: <12, (5, 4), 9>

Step 3:
There are 12 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the final result is [12].
