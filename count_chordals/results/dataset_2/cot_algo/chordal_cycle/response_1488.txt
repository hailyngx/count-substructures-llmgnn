Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 19) (7, 25) (7, 15) (7, 5) (21, 10) (21, 12) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 20) (22, 26) (22, 20) (22, 3) (1, 25) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 22) (3, 13) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 27) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 11) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 29) (8, 25) (26, 22) (26, 16) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 23) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 28) (2, 14) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 12) (0, 29) (16, 6) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 20) (24, 16) (24, 28) (24, 14) (15, 9) (15, 7) (23, 27) (23, 28) (29, 8) (29, 19) (29, 0) (29, 13) (14, 2) (14, 24) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 27) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 29) (20, 18) (20, 22) (20, 16) (20, 28) (12, 21) (12, 1) (12, 25) (12, 19) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 4) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 23) (28, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

There are several cycles with 4 or more nodes present in the graph. 

One of the cycles is <4, 6, 16, 26>. 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

The cycle <4, 6, 16, 26> has only one chord, which is the edge (6, 26).

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, 6, 16, 26>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, the final count is [1].
