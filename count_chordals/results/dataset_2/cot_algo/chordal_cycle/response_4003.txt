Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 1) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 1) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists: 
- Cycle 1: (0, 9, 7, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 12, 6)
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 11, 6)
- Cycle 4: (3, 9, 7, 10)
- Cycle 5: (4, 14, 11, 2)
- Cycle 6: (8, 6, 12, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (1, 7).
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (4, 12).
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord (5, 11).
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord (2, 11).
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord (6, 12).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (1, 7), 9, 7>.
