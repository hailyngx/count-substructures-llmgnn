Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-4-7-1

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 9)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (5, 6), 9)>
<2, (5, 9), 4)>
