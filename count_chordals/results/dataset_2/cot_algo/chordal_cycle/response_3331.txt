Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: 2-5-4-8-2
        - Cycle 2: 2-5-9-7-2
        - Cycle 3: 2-5-9-8-2
        - Cycle 4: 2-7-9-8-2
        - Cycle 5: 2-7-6-1-2
        - Cycle 6: 2-7-3-6-2
        - Cycle 7: 4-9-7-6-4
        - Cycle 8: 4-5-2-7-4
        - Cycle 9: 4-5-9-7-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Cycle 1 contains a chord (5,8).
        - Cycle 2 contains a chord (5,7).
        - Cycle 3 contains a chord (5,8).
        - Cycle 4 contains a chord (7,9).
        - Cycle 5 contains a chord (7,6).
        - Cycle 6 contains a chord (7,6).
        - Cycle 7 contains a chord (9,7).
        - Cycle 8 contains a chord (5,7).
        - Cycle 9 contains a chord (5,9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

        So, the number of unique chordal 4-cylces in the graph is [9].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
        - <2, 5, 4, 8>
        - <2, 5, 9, 7>
        - <4, 9, 7, 6>
        - <4, 5, 2, 7>
        - <4, 5, 9, 7>
