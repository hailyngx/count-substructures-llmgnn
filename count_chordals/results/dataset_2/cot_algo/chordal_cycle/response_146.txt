Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 22) (1, 7) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 12) (2, 29) (2, 26) (2, 9) (2, 20) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 24) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 16) (9, 2) (18, 20) (18, 3) (22, 1) (22, 4) (22, 17) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 3) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 3) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 23) (17, 15) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 23) (26, 2) (26, 6) (20, 21) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 18) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 24) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 25) (23, 19) (16, 21) (16, 27) (16, 8) (6, 26) (6, 24) (6, 14) (24, 29) (24, 10) (24, 6) (24, 28) (28, 12) (28, 24) (28, 25) (4, 22) (4, 11) (4, 14) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 19) (3, 18) (3, 12) (3, 8) (13, 10) (13, 25) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 13) (19, 23) (19, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, with only a few that are of length 4:
- Cycle 1: {1, 14, 4, 22, 1}
- Cycle 2: {1, 7, 23, 17, 1}
- Cycle 3: {21, 12, 3, 18, 21}
- Cycle 4: {2, 20, 21, 16, 2}
- Cycle 5: {29, 2, 9, 27, 29}
- Cycle 6: {0, 12, 3, 8, 0}
- Cycle 7: {27, 16, 8, 15, 27}
- Cycle 8: {9, 2, 20, 18, 9}
- Cycle 9: {18, 3, 12, 27, 18}
- Cycle 10: {22, 1, 7, 0, 22}
- Cycle 11: {12, 21, 20, 2, 12}
- Cycle 12: {8, 16, 27, 12, 8}
- Cycle 13: {17, 29, 24, 10, 17}
- Cycle 14: {7, 1, 14, 19, 7}
- Cycle 15: {26, 6, 14, 4, 26}
- Cycle 16: {20, 29, 24, 28, 20}
- Cycle 17: {10, 15, 17, 23, 10}
- Cycle 18: {15, 8, 3, 12, 15}
- Cycle 19: {11, 4, 22, 17, 11}
- Cycle 20: {23, 7, 1, 14, 23}
- Cycle 21: {16, 21, 12, 28, 16}
- Cycle 22: {6, 14, 1, 22, 6}
- Cycle 23: {24, 29, 20, 18, 24}
- Cycle 24: {28, 25, 13, 10, 28}
- Cycle 25: {4, 11, 14, 19, 4}
- Cycle 26: {14, 19, 23, 25, 14}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: {1, 14, 4, 22, 1} - Chord: (1, 22)
- Cycle 2: {1, 7, 23, 17, 1} - Chord: (1, 17)
- Cycle 16: {20, 29, 24, 10, 20} - Chord: (20, 24)
- Cycle 21: {16, 21, 12, 28, 16} - Chord: (16, 28)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, therefore the final number is [4].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (1, 22), 14>
- <1, (1, 17), 7>
- <20, (20, 24), 29>
- <16, (16, 28), 21>
