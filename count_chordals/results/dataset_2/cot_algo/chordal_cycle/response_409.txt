Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 26) (18, 22) (18, 16) (18, 6) (22, 18) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 6) (20, 10) (25, 7) (25, 28) (8, 4) (8, 5) (17, 20) (17, 15) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 27) (9, 19) (13, 20) (13, 23) (13, 6) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 23) (21, 9) (21, 3) (21, 2) (21, 29) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 6) (26, 7) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 29) (28, 25) (28, 3) (28, 0) (2, 21) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 26) (5, 0) (12, 24) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 29) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 23) (16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 23) (11, 7) (11, 27) (0, 4) (0, 28) (0, 5) (6, 18) (6, 20) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 27) (24, 12) (1, 19) (1, 16) (29, 21) (29, 26) (29, 15) (10, 20) (10, 23) (27, 9) (27, 11) (27, 6) (23, 13) (23, 3) (23, 19) (23, 16) (23, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: (4, 7, 16, 1, 4)
2. Cycle 2: (4, 7, 26, 14, 4)
3. Cycle 3: (4, 5, 26, 7, 4)
4. Cycle 4: (4, 5, 8, 4)
5. Cycle 5: (7, 16, 1, 19, 9, 27, 11, 7)
6. Cycle 6: (7, 16, 1, 19, 15, 17, 20, 6, 14, 26, 7)
7. Cycle 7: (4, 8, 5, 26, 7, 16, 18, 22, 18, 6, 13, 20, 17, 15, 19, 9, 21, 3, 23, 13, 6, 14, 26, 14, 6, 20, 6, 18, 16, 23, 19, 15, 17, 20, 10, 23, 3, 21, 9, 14, 26, 14, 6, 20, 10, 23, 19, 1, 16, 7, 26, 5, 4)
8. Cycle 8: (4, 7, 11, 27, 6, 20, 17, 15, 29, 21, 9, 19, 23, 16, 7)
9. Cycle 9: (4, 5, 0, 28, 3, 21, 2, 29, 15, 17, 20, 13, 6, 14, 26, 5)
10. Cycle 10: (20, 10, 23, 19, 9, 21, 3, 28, 0, 5, 26, 14, 6, 20, 17, 15, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

1. Cycle 1 has the chord (7, 1)
2. Cycle 2 has the chord (7, 14)
3. Cycle 3 has the chord (5, 26)
4. Cycle 4 has the chord (5, 8)
5. Cycle 5 has the chord (16, 19)
6. Cycle 6 has the chord (16, 17)
7. Cycle 7 has the chord (5, 26)
8. Cycle 8 has the chord (7, 27)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [2] unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<4, 7, 16, 1>, (7, 1)
<4, 7, 26, 14>, (7, 14)
