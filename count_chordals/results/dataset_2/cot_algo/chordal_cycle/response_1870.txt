Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 0) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 7, 0, 5, 13, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 7, 14, 10, 13, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 12, 4, 5, 13, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 12, 14, 10, 13, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 7, 0, 5, 13, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 7, 1, 13, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 7, 14, 10, 13, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 8, 13, 1, 12, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 14, 0, 5, 13, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 14, 10, 13, 3)
- Cycle 11: (5, 4, 12, 1, 13, 5)
- Cycle 12: (6, 4, 5, 0, 7, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Only Cycle 12: (6, 4, 5, 0, 7, 6) has exactly one chord (0, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There is one chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, so the count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <<6, (0, 5), 7, 4>>
