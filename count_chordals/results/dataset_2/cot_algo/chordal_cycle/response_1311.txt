Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 11) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 10) (8, 5) (8, 17) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 10) (10, 2) (10, 7) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 13) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 17) (11, 9) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 13) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 11) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 8) (17, 18) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 15 - 13 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 11 - 13 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 16 - 2 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 14 - 12 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 15 - 19 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 11 - 19 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 7: 6 - 2 - 16 - 13 - 6
- Cycle 8: 1 - 3 - 19 - 11 - 1
- Cycle 9: 1 - 14 - 12 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 10: 15 - 13 - 11 - 9 - 15
- Cycle 11: 16 - 5 - 14 - 1 - 16
- Cycle 12: 18 - 9 - 11 - 19 - 18
- Cycle 13: 18 - 0 - 4 - 7 - 18

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 6 has a chord: <6, 13, 2>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <7, 16, 13>
- Cycle 8 has a chord: <8, 11, 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, 9, 15, 13>
<5, 9, 11, 13>
<5, 16, 2, 6>
<5, 14, 12, 1>
<9, 15, 19, 3>
<16, 5, 14, 1>
<18, 9, 11, 19>
<18, 0, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 19, 11>
<6, 2, 16, 13>
