Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (0, 16, 24, 0)
        - Cycle 2: (1, 26, 15, 5, 1)
        - Cycle 3: (3, 23, 4, 25, 3)
        - Cycle 4: (20, 25, 4, 24, 20)
        - Cycle 5: (10, 2, 21, 29, 10)
        - Cycle 6: (17, 1, 7, 11, 17)
        - Cycle 7: (27, 13, 5, 3, 27)
        - Cycle 8: (28, 22, 11, 7, 28)
        - Cycle 9: (18, 3, 23, 17, 18)
        - Cycle 10: (19, 18, 15, 26, 19)
        - Cycle 11: (16, 0, 12, 24, 16)
        - Cycle 12: (9, 15, 19, 18, 9)
        - Cycle 13: (22, 17, 1, 26, 22)
        - Cycle 14: (8, 25, 4, 24, 8)
        - Cycle 15: (12, 0, 16, 24, 12)
        - Cycle 16: (21, 29, 20, 25, 21)
        - Cycle 17: (2, 10, 29, 21, 2)
        - Cycle 18: (6, 27, 13, 5, 6)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 2 <1, 26, (15), 5, 1>
        - Cycle 6 <17, 1, (7), 11, 17>
        - Cycle 9 <18, 3, (23), 17, 18>
        - Cycle 10 <19, 18, (15), 26, 19>
        - Cycle 13 <22, 17, (1), 26, 22>

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [5] 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        - <1, 26, (15), 5, 1>
        - <17, 1, (7), 11, 17>
        - <18, 3, (23), 17, 18>
        - <19, 18, (15), 26, 19>
        - <22, 17, (1), 26, 22>
