Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 8) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Here are all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-5-13-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-10-11-14-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-4-9-0
- Cycle 4: 2-13-5-8-2
- Cycle 5: 2-0-3-12-2

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, we see that Cycle 1 <0, 9, 13, 5> and Cycle 2 <0, 10, 11, 14> both have exactly one chord: (9, 13) and (10, 11) respectively.

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
