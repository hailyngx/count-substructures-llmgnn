Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (11, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1 - 3 - 4 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 3 - 4 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 3 - 6 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 4 - 6 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 4 - 3 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 4 - 8 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 6 - 4 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 8: 1 - 6 - 3 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 9: 1 - 8 - 3 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 10: 1 - 8 - 4 - 3 - 1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 2: 1 - 3 - 4 - 8 - 1 (Chord: 3-8)
- Cycle 5: 1 - 4 - 3 - 8 - 1 (Chord: 4-3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- Final count: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (3, 8), 4>
- <1, (4, 3), 8>
