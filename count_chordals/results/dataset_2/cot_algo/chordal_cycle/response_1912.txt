Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 9-5-6-4-9
- Cycle 2: 6-5-1-9-6
- Cycle 3: 1-5-7-4-1
- Cycle 4: 5-7-4-8-5
- Cycle 5: 4-7-5-6-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle:
- <9, (5, 4), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 0 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycle in the graph is [1].
