Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-4-7-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-2-0-6
- Cycle 3: 6-9-3-0-6
- Cycle 4: 6-1-3-0-6
- Cycle 5: 6-1-5-7-6
- Cycle 6: 6-1-8-5-6
- Cycle 7: 9-2-7-4-9
- Cycle 8: 9-2-8-5-9
- Cycle 9: 9-3-0-7-9
- Cycle 10: 1-3-5-7-1
- Cycle 11: 1-3-0-9-1
- Cycle 12: 1-5-8-6-1
- Cycle 13: 3-5-7-4-3
- Cycle 14: 3-5-8-2-3
- Cycle 15: 4-7-0-2-4
- Cycle 16: 7-0-2-9-7
- Cycle 17: 7-0-3-9-7
- Cycle 18: 8-5-1-6-8
- Cycle 19: 8-5-7-4-8
- Cycle 20: 8-2-9-6-8
- Cycle 21: 5-1-6-8-5
- Cycle 22: 5-7-0-3-5
- Cycle 23: 5-7-4-9-5
- Cycle 24: 2-9-6-1-2

Step 2:
Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- <6, 9, 2, 0>
- <6, 1, 5, 8>
- <1, 3, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 7, 4>
- <2, 7, 4, 9>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]
