Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:  
- Cycle 1: 0-4-1-5-0  
- Cycle 2: 0-6-1-5-0  
- Cycle 3: 0-1-3-7-0  
- Cycle 4: 0-2-8-4-0  
- Cycle 5: 0-6-1-7-0  
- Cycle 6: 0-2-8-3-0  
- Cycle 7: 0-4-9-7-0  
- Cycle 8: 1-3-7-5-1  
- Cycle 9: 1-3-8-2-1  
- Cycle 10: 1-7-4-9-1  

Step 2:  
Out of the cycles listed above, only two cycles have exactly one chord, making them chordal 4-cycles:  
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (4, 1), 5>  
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (2, 8), 4>  

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we get [2].  
  
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
