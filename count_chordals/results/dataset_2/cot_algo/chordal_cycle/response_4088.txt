Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

One of the cycles in the given graph is:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 10, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

For Cycle 1, the chord is (9, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Based on the above analysis, there is 0 chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, so the final answer is [0].
