Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 13) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (5, 15) (5, 3) (19, 4) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 8) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 2) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 3) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (10, 3) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 10) (2, 14) (2, 16) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 6) (11, 17) (11, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 7, 12, 1)
- Cycle 2: (4, 18, 17, 4)
- Cycle 3: (3, 5, 15, 3)
- Cycle 4: (16, 1, 17, 16)
- Cycle 5: (3, 9, 15, 3)
- Cycle 6: (6, 3, 10, 6)
- Cycle 7: (9, 15, 17, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 12)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (18, 17)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (5, 15)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1, 17)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (3, 15)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (3, 10)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (15, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
