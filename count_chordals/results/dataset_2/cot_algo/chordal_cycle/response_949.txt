The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 26) (15, 20) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 18) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 20) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 14) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 5) (29, 18) (13, 26) (13, 28) (13, 19) (26, 3) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 2) (28, 13) (28, 26) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 12) (25, 5) (18, 7) (18, 29) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 16) (0, 11) (0, 16) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 5) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 1) (2, 21) (22, 27) (22, 6) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 23) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 27) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (24, 17) (24, 21) (21, 2) (21, 24) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 14) (27, 17) (27, 22) (27, 6) (27, 21) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 19) (5, 29) (5, 25) (5, 16) (23, 12) (23, 21) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 10) (14, 20) (14, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (3, 6, 22, 27)
- Cycle 2: (3, 6, 17, 24)
- Cycle 3: (3, 26, 13, 19)
- Cycle 4: (3, 26, 28, 13)
- Cycle 5: (3, 26, 18, 7)
- Cycle 6: (3, 26, 2, 1)
- Cycle 7: (15, 20, 8, 4)
- Cycle 8: (15, 20, 14, 21)
- Cycle 9: (15, 2, 26, 13)
- Cycle 10: (15, 2, 1, 7)
- Cycle 11: (4, 7, 1, 9)
- Cycle 12: (4, 7, 18, 29)
- Cycle 13: (4, 8, 20, 14)
- Cycle 14: (4, 8, 10, 19)
- Cycle 15: (4, 11, 0, 16)
- Cycle 16: (7, 18, 10, 19)
- Cycle 17: (8, 20, 15, 2)
- Cycle 18: (17, 29, 5, 25)
- Cycle 19: (17, 29, 18, 7)
- Cycle 20: (17, 29, 18, 26)
- Cycle 21: (17, 24, 21, 2)
- Cycle 22: (17, 24, 21, 14)
- Cycle 23: (29, 18, 7, 4)
- Cycle 24: (29, 18, 10, 8)
- Cycle 25: (13, 26, 2, 15)
- Cycle 26: (13, 26, 18, 16)
- Cycle 27: (26, 28, 13, 19)
- Cycle 28: (26, 28, 13, 3)
- Cycle 29: (26, 3, 6, 17)
- Cycle 30: (26, 3, 6, 27)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (4, 8), 10>
- <2, (15, 20), 14>
- <3, (13, 26), 19>
- <4, (7, 18), 10>
- <5, (17, 29), 25>
- <6, (3, 26), 18>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]
