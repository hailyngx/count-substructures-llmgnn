Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 9) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 9) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 4) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 12) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 18) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (18, 9) (18, 15) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 17) (19, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all edges existing:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-9-10-4-2-6
- Cycle 2: 1-3-9-18-15-2-6
- Cycle 3: 1-3-9-18-15-16-8
- Cycle 4: 1-13-0-14-5-15-2
- Cycle 5: 1-13-0-14-5-15-16
- Cycle 6: 1-13-11-17-10-4-2
- Cycle 7: 1-13-11-17-10-4-6
- Cycle 8: 1-13-11-17-19-15-2
- Cycle 9: 1-13-11-17-19-15-16
- Cycle 10: 3-9-18-15-16-7-8
- Cycle 11: 3-9-18-15-19-17-11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 6 has one chord (4, 2)
- Cycle 7 has one chord (4, 6)
- Cycle 8 has one chord (17, 2)
- Cycle 9 has one chord (17, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph. Hence, the final count is [0].
