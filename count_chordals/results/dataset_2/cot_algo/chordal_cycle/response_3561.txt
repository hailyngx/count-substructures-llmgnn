Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 3, 5, 4)
- (1, 3, 8, 4)
- (1, 4, 8, 3)
- (1, 5, 3, 6)
- (1, 5, 4, 6)
- (1, 7, 8, 4)
- (3, 5, 4, 6)
- (3, 8, 4, 6)
- (4, 8, 3, 6)
- (5, 4, 6, 3)
- (5, 2, 6, 3)
- (6, 4, 8, 3)
- (6, 7, 8, 3)
- (7, 8, 3, 6)
- (0, 2, 6, 3)
- (0, 2, 9, 4)
- (0, 7, 8, 3)
- (0, 9, 4, 8)
- (0, 9, 2, 5)
- (9, 4, 8, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (4, 8), 3, 5>
- <1, (3, 8), 4, 5>
- <1, (5, 8), 4, 3>
- <1, (3, 8), 5, 6>
- <1, (5, 3), 4, 6>
- <1, (7, 8), 4, 3>
- <3, (4, 5), 6, 8>
- <4, (3, 6), 8, 5>
- <5, (4, 6), 3, 1>
- <5, (6, 2), 3, 1>
- <6, (3, 8), 4, 1>
- <6, (7, 3), 8, 4>
- <7, (3, 8), 6, 1>
- <0, (2, 6), 3, 9>
- <0, (2, 9), 4, 6>
- <0, (7, 8), 3, 6>
- <0, (4, 8), 9, 2>
- <0, (2, 5), 9, 4>
- <9, (4, 8), 7, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles is [18].
