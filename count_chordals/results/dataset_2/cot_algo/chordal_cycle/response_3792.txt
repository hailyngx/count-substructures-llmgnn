Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 5) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 2: (0, 10, 13, 14, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 12, 8, 11, 0)
- Cycle 4: (2, 7, 6, 14, 2)
- Cycle 5: (3, 1, 9, 14, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 11, 10, 5, 3)
- Cycle 7: (4, 3, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 12, 0, 4)
- Cycle 9: (5, 2, 7, 14, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 6, 4, 13, 5)
- Cycle 11: (5, 10, 9, 14, 5)
- Cycle 12: (6, 3, 4, 13, 6)
- Cycle 13: (6, 5, 10, 11, 6)
- Cycle 14: (6, 7, 14, 13, 6)
- Cycle 15: (8, 11, 3, 4, 8)
- Cycle 16: (9, 1, 3, 11, 9)
- Cycle 17: (9, 10, 5, 14, 9)
- Cycle 18: (9, 14, 13, 4, 9)
- Cycle 19: (10, 0, 12, 8, 10)
- Cycle 20: (10, 5, 6, 3, 10)
- Cycle 21: (11, 0, 14, 13, 11)
- Cycle 22: (11, 3, 4, 8, 11)
- Cycle 23: (13, 4, 3, 6, 13)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (10, 8) -> <1, (10, 8), 0>
- Cycle 2 has one chord (10, 13) -> <2, (10, 13), 0>
- Cycle 3 has one chord (8, 12) -> <3, (8, 12), 0>
- Cycle 4 has one chord (7, 14) -> <4, (7, 14), 6>
- Cycle 5 has one chord (1, 9) -> <5, (1, 9), 3>
- Cycle 6 has one chord (5, 10) -> <6, (5, 10), 3>
- Cycle 7 has one chord (4, 7) -> <7, (4, 7), 6>
- Cycle 8 has one chord (5, 13) -> <8, (5, 13), 4>
- Cycle 9 has one chord (9, 10) -> <9, (9, 10), 5>
- Cycle 10 has one chord (3, 13) -> <10, (3, 13), 6>
- Cycle 11 has one chord (9, 5) -> <11, (9, 5), 10>
- Cycle 12 has one chord (3, 13) -> <12, (3, 13), 6>
- Cycle 13 has one chord (10, 11) -> <13, (10, 11), 6>
- Cycle 14 has one chord (6, 13) -> <14, (6, 13), 4>
- Cycle 15 has one chord (8, 4) -> <15, (8, 4), 11>
- Cycle 16 has one chord (1, 11) -> <16, (1, 11), 3>
- Cycle 17 has one chord (10, 5) -> <17, (10, 5), 9>
- Cycle 18 has one chord (4, 14) -> <18, (4, 14), 9>
- Cycle 19 has one chord (10, 8) -> <19, (10, 8), 0>
- Cycle 20 has one chord (5, 6) -> <20, (5, 6), 10>
- Cycle 21 has one chord (11, 13) -> <21, (11, 13), 4>
- Cycle 22 has one chord (4, 8) -> <22, (4, 8), 11>
- Cycle 23 has one chord (6, 14) -> <23, (6, 14), 13>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [23]
