Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 23) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 9) (20, 22) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 26) (29, 16) (29, 0) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 26) (26, 29) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 23) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 21) (16, 22) (21, 16) (21, 27) (21, 5) (21, 11) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 14) (11, 21) (11, 18) (14, 5) (14, 4) (23, 13) (23, 26) (23, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 4) (9, 3) (9, 20) (25, 24) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 28) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 24) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 20) (12, 28) (6, 4) (7, 18) (27, 17) (27, 21) (27, 28) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 7) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 24) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 24) (24, 25) (24, 28) (24, 22) (24, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: {1, 2, 3, 10}
- Cycle 2: {1, 5, 26, 23}
- Cycle 3: {3, 9, 20, 15}
- Cycle 4: {15, 18, 11, 21}
- Cycle 5: {15, 19, 3, 10}
- Cycle 6: {15, 4, 6, 8}
- Cycle 7: {15, 20, 22, 24}
- Cycle 8: {17, 27, 28, 0}
- Cycle 9: {17, 27, 21, 16}
- Cycle 10: {17, 16, 29, 0}
- Cycle 11: {17, 29, 26, 5}
- Cycle 12: {26, 19, 3, 10}
- Cycle 13: {26, 5, 14, 4}
- Cycle 14: {26, 23, 0, 29}
- Cycle 15: {16, 29, 0, 23}
- Cycle 16: {16, 21, 11, 18}
- Cycle 17: {16, 22, 24, 4}
- Cycle 18: {21, 27, 28, 0}
- Cycle 19: {21, 5, 1, 2}
- Cycle 20: {5, 26, 29, 17}
- Cycle 21: {5, 14, 4, 6}
- Cycle 22: {5, 21, 11, 18}
- Cycle 23: {14, 4, 10, 3}
- Cycle 24: {23, 26, 29, 17}
- Cycle 25: {23, 0, 28, 27}
- Cycle 26: {10, 3, 19, 15}
- Cycle 27: {10, 8, 13, 23}
- Cycle 28: {10, 18, 11, 21}
- Cycle 29: {10, 4, 6, 8}
- Cycle 30: {9, 3, 19, 15}
- Cycle 31: {9, 20, 22, 24}

Step 2: 
The only chordal 4-cycle found is:
- Cycle 10: <17, 16, 29, 0>

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
