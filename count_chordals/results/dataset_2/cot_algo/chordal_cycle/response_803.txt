Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 0) (16, 22) (5, 12) (9, 8) (9, 13) (0, 11) (0, 26) (0, 6) (27, 7) (27, 6) (27, 8) (22, 16) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 29) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 3) (28, 11) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 25) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 2) (6, 0) (6, 27) (6, 21) (6, 4) (21, 6) (18, 26) (18, 7) (18, 1) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 25) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 17) (20, 29) (20, 12) (29, 22) (29, 20) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 12) (3, 23) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 2) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 19) (12, 17) (7, 27) (7, 18) (7, 13) (17, 15) (17, 19) (17, 12) (24, 3) (2, 26) (2, 15) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (1, 18) (1, 25) (25, 28) (25, 10) (25, 14) (25, 1) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 0-11-28-26-0
- Cycle 2: 2-26-28-25-2
- Cycle 3: 2-26-0-6-2
- Cycle 4: 3-23-26-28-3
- Cycle 5: 4-22-29-20-4
- Cycle 6: 6-27-7-18-6
- Cycle 7: 8-9-13-7-8
- Cycle 8: 8-19-12-17-8
- Cycle 9: 10-15-2-26-10
- Cycle 10: 13-9-8-27-13
- Cycle 11: 14-25-28-11-14
- Cycle 12: 19-11-0-26-19
- Cycle 13: 20-29-22-16-20
- Cycle 14: 22-16-22
- Cycle 15: 23-22-29-20-23
- Cycle 16: 24-3-23-26-24

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (11, 28), 26, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (26, 28), 25, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, (26, 0), 6, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, (23, 26), 28, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, (22, 29), 20, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (27, 7), 18, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <8, (9, 13), 7, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (19, 12), 17, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <10, (15, 2), 26, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <13, (9, 8), 27, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <14, (25, 28), 11, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <19, (11, 0), 26, 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <20, (29, 22), 16, 20>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <23, (22, 29), 20, 23>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <24, (3, 23), 26, 24>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [15].
