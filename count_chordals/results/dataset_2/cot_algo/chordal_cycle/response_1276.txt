Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (17, 15) (17, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (11, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (7, 18) (7, 1) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 18) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (1, 7) (1, 19) (1, 12) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 8) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 1) (4, 17) (4, 3) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 2, 10, 6)
- Cycle 2: (9, 13, 5, 2, 9)
- Cycle 3: (8, 13, 9, 16, 8)
- Cycle 4: (13, 8, 3, 4, 13)
- Cycle 5: (13, 9, 16, 8, 13)
- Cycle 6: (6, 9, 16, 8, 6)
- Cycle 7: (9, 15, 17, 4, 9)
- Cycle 8: (0, 3, 8, 12, 0)
- Cycle 9: (5, 13, 9, 16, 5)
- Cycle 10: (9, 16, 8, 12, 9)
- Cycle 11: (18, 7, 1, 19, 18)
- Cycle 12: (7, 1, 12, 0, 7)
- Cycle 13: (8, 14, 11, 4, 8)
- Cycle 14: (13, 8, 14, 4, 13)
- Cycle 15: (2, 5, 13, 9, 2)
- Cycle 16: (3, 8, 14, 4, 3)
- Cycle 17: (5, 18, 12, 0, 5)
- Cycle 18: (18, 5, 13, 9, 18)
- Cycle 19: (12, 8, 13, 5, 12)
- Cycle 20: (1, 7, 18, 5, 1)
- Cycle 21: (16, 8, 13, 5, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal Cycle 1: <1, (2, 10), 6>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <2, (5, 13), 9>
- Chordal Cycle 3: <3, (8, 16), 9>
- Chordal Cycle 4: <4, (3, 4), 13>
- Chordal Cycle 5: <5, (13, 16), 8>
- Chordal Cycle 6: <6, (6, 9), 16>
- Chordal Cycle 7: <8, (9, 17), 15>
- Chordal Cycle 8: <9, (0, 12), 3>
- Chordal Cycle 9: <11, (5, 16), 9>
- Chordal Cycle 10: <12, (8, 16), 9>
- Chordal Cycle 11: <14, (8, 13), 4>
- Chordal Cycle 12: <15, (13, 8), 9>
- Chordal Cycle 13: <17, (3, 14), 8>
- Chordal Cycle 14: <18, (5, 13), 9>
- Chordal Cycle 15: <19, (5, 13), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [15].
