Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (3, 8) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 6) (4, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- <5, 9, 8, 5>
- <5, 9, 7, 6, 8, 5>
- <5, 9, 7, 12, 0, 13, 5>
- <5, 11, 3, 8, 5>
- <5, 11, 12, 0, 13, 5>
- <5, 11, 14, 8, 5>
- <5, 13, 0, 12, 11, 5>
- <7, 9, 5, 11, 12, 7>
- <7, 9, 8, 5, 13, 14, 7>
- <7, 12, 0, 13, 14, 6, 7>
- <8, 5, 13, 0, 12, 11, 3, 8>
- <9, 7, 12, 0, 13, 5, 11, 9>
- <9, 8, 14, 13, 0, 12, 11, 9>
- <11, 14, 13, 0, 12, 7, 9, 11>
- <0, 12, 7, 6, 14, 13, 5, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, 9, 8, 5> (Chord: (5, 8))
- <5, 9, 7, 6, 8, 5> (Chord: (8, 5))
- <5, 11, 3, 8, 5> (Chord: (3, 5))
- <5, 13, 0, 12, 11, 5> (Chord: (13, 12))
- <7, 9, 8, 5, 13, 14, 7> (Chord: (5, 14))
- <8, 5, 13, 0, 12, 11, 3, 8> (Chord: (5, 3))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [6]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:

- <5, 9, 8, 5>
- <5, 9, 7, 6, 8, 5>
- <5, 11, 3, 8, 5>
- <5, 13, 0, 12, 11, 5>
- <7, 9, 8, 5, 13, 14, 7>
- <8, 5, 13, 0, 12, 11, 3, 8>
