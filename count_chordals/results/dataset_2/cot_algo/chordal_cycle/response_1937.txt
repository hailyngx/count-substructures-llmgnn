Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 14) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 2, 5)
2. Cycle 2: (5, 8, 13, 2, 5)
3. Cycle 3: (5, 1, 11, 10, 5)
4. Cycle 4: (9, 6, 7, 3, 9)
5. Cycle 5: (9, 4, 14, 11, 9)
6. Cycle 6: (6, 7, 3, 2, 6)
7. Cycle 7: (1, 11, 14, 4, 1)
8. Cycle 8: (3, 7, 0, 13, 3)
9. Cycle 9: (8, 13, 0, 12, 8)
10. Cycle 10: (13, 0, 11, 14, 13)
11. Cycle 11: (4, 14, 11, 0, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 4 has chord: (6, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (9, 2), 6, 5>
2. <4, (6, 3), 9, 14>
