Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 6, 4, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 1, 3, 4, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 1, 8, 4, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 4, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 4, 3, 1, 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, 4, 8, 1, 5>
- Cycle 7: <9, 6, 1, 5, 9>
- Cycle 8: <9, 6, 4, 5, 9>
- Cycle 9: <9, 8, 1, 5, 9>
- Cycle 10: <9, 8, 4, 5, 9>
- Cycle 11: <6, 1, 3, 4, 6>
- Cycle 12: <6, 1, 8, 4, 6>
- Cycle 13: <6, 4, 3, 1, 6>
- Cycle 14: <6, 4, 8, 1, 6>
- Cycle 15: <1, 3, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle 16: <1, 8, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle 17: <3, 1, 8, 4, 3>
- Cycle 18: <3, 4, 8, 1, 3>
- Cycle 19: <4, 3, 1, 8, 4>
- Cycle 20: <4, 8, 1, 3, 4>

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- The cycle <5, 1, 6, 4, 5> has exactly one chord (1, 4).
- The cycle <5, 4, 3, 1, 5> has exactly one chord (4, 1).
- The cycle <9, 8, 1, 5, 9> has exactly one chord (8, 5).
- The cycle <9, 6, 4, 5, 9> has exactly one chord (6, 5).
- The cycle <6, 1, 3, 4, 6> has exactly one chord (1, 4).
- The cycle <1, 3, 4, 6, 1> has exactly one chord (3, 6).
- The cycle <4, 3, 1, 8, 4> has exactly one chord (3, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, 1, 6, 4, 5>
<5, 4, 3, 1, 5>
<9, 8, 1, 5, 9>
<9, 6, 4, 5, 9>
<6, 1, 3, 4, 6>
<1, 3, 4, 6, 1>
<4, 3, 1, 8, 4>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [7].
