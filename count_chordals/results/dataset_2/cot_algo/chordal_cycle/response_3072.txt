Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <2, 29, 26, 23, 11>
- Cycle 2: <2, 29, 11, 4, 8>
- Cycle 3: <2, 22, 27, 8, 4>
- Cycle 4: <2, 22, 27, 21, 26>
- Cycle 5: <2, 22, 12, 6, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 22, 12, 6, 7>
- Cycle 7: <2, 29, 25, 23, 26>
- Cycle 8: <2, 29, 25, 23, 11>
- Cycle 9: <2, 29, 25, 9, 24>
- Cycle 10: <2, 29, 25, 9, 10>
- Cycle 11: <2, 29, 11, 20, 14>
- Cycle 12: <29, 26, 24, 9, 25>
- Cycle 13: <29, 26, 21, 27, 22>
- Cycle 14: <29, 11, 23, 5, 15>
- Cycle 15: <29, 11, 20, 14, 18>
- Cycle 16: <24, 26, 21, 27, 8>
- Cycle 17: <24, 26, 23, 11, 20>
- Cycle 18: <24, 26, 23, 5, 15>
- Cycle 19: <24, 9, 25, 23, 5>
- Cycle 20: <24, 9, 25, 13, 16>
- Cycle 21: <26, 29, 11, 20, 14>
- Cycle 22: <26, 29, 25, 23, 5>
- Cycle 23: <26, 23, 11, 20, 14>
- Cycle 24: <26, 23, 5, 15, 24>
- Cycle 25: <26, 23, 5, 7, 6>
- Cycle 26: <26, 21, 27, 22, 12>
- Cycle 27: <26, 21, 27, 8, 4>
- Cycle 28: <15, 24, 9, 25, 29>
- Cycle 29: <15, 5, 23, 11, 4>
- Cycle 30: <11, 29, 25, 9, 24>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 1: <2, 29, 26, 23, 11> has exactly one chord (26, 11).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
