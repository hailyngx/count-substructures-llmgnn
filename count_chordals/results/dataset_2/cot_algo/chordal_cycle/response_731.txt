Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
<5, 9, 12, 0, 5>
<5, 13, 3, 2, 4, 5>
<9, 10, 2, 4, 12, 9>
<8, 13, 1, 4, 12, 8>
<8, 11, 0, 12, 9, 8>
<13, 14, 0, 12, 4, 13>
<4, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4>
<7, 3, 2, 10, 8, 7>
<6, 3, 2, 10, 6>
<0, 14, 13, 3, 2, 10, 0>
<14, 11, 0, 12, 4, 14>

Step 2: 
- Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
<5, 9, 12, 0, 5> has 1 chord: (9, 12)
<5, 13, 3, 2, 4, 5> has 1 chord: (13, 4)
<9, 10, 2, 4, 12, 9> has 1 chord: (10, 12)
<8, 13, 1, 4, 12, 8> has 1 chord: (13, 1)
<8, 11, 0, 12, 9, 8> has 1 chord: (11, 12)
<13, 14, 0, 12, 4, 13> has 1 chord: (14, 4)
<4, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4> has 1 chord: (2, 6)
<7, 3, 2, 10, 8, 7> has 1 chord: (3, 8)
<6, 3, 2, 10, 6> has 1 chord: (3, 10)
<0, 14, 13, 3, 2, 10, 0> has 1 chord: (13, 10)
<14, 11, 0, 12, 4, 14> has 1 chord: (11, 4)

Step 3:
- There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found. 
- So, the number of chordless cycles found is [11].
