Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-7-5-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-7-14-8-2-12-10-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-5-9-1-13-8-0
- Cycle 4: 1-9-12-2-8-13-1
- Cycle 5: 3-8-2-12-10-6-3
- Cycle 6: 3-11-4-0-7-14-11
- Cycle 7: 6-10-12-4-6

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord (5-9).
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord (8-12).
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord (4-13).
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord (9-1).
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord (8-12).
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord (0-14).
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord (10-4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, (5, 9), 4>
2. <2, (8, 12), 10>
3. <4, (4, 13), 7>
4. <1, (9, 1), 13>
5. <3, (8, 12), 3>
6. <11, (0, 14), 7>
7. <6, (10, 4), 12>
