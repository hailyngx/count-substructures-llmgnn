Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 6) (7, 19) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 15) (20, 13) (20, 4) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 16) (25, 12) (3, 25) (3, 22) (3, 18) (12, 25) (12, 27) (12, 24) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 9) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 20) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 18) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 0) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 11) (22, 3) (22, 26) (22, 29) (11, 26) (4, 20) (4, 19) (6, 7) (6, 24) (6, 0) (24, 12) (24, 8) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 10) (15, 21) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 16) (19, 7) (19, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 0) (5, 21) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 23) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 10) (29, 7) (29, 22) (29, 0) (9, 25) (9, 27) (16, 25) (16, 15) (16, 17) (17, 24) (17, 2) (17, 23) (17, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (10, 8) (10, 24) (10, 23) (14, 12) (14, 15) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph. 

Some of the cycles are: 
- Cycle 1: 7 - 21 - 5 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 2: 7 - 21 - 15 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 3: 20 - 13 - 8 - 24 - 20
- Cycle 4: 25 - 3 - 22 - 26 - 25

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles: 
- Cycle 1 has a chord (5, 1).
- Cycle 2 has a chord (15, 8).
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.

Step 3: 
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
- <7, 21, 5, (1, 7)>
- <7, 21, 15, (8, 7)>
