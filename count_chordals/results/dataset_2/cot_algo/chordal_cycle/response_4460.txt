Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 11) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 2) (7, 11) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 19) (13, 5) (13, 19) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 15) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 19) (1, 5) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 6, 17, 11, 7, 0, 3, 5)
- Cycle 3: (14, 17, 6, 9, 14)
- Cycle 4: (14, 17, 11, 7, 0, 14)
- Cycle 5: (14, 12, 4, 18, 10, 8, 14)
- Cycle 6: (17, 14, 12, 3, 0, 17)
- Cycle 7: (6, 9, 14, 12, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 17, 14, 0, 7, 6)
- Cycle 9: (10, 8, 14, 17, 11, 2, 4, 12, 10)
- Cycle 10: (11, 17, 14, 12, 3, 0, 11)
- Cycle 11: (7, 11, 17, 14, 0, 7)
- Cycle 12: (12, 14, 0, 7, 11, 12)
- Cycle 13: (4, 12, 14, 0, 3, 4)
- Cycle 14: (18, 4, 12, 3, 0, 7, 11, 18)
- Cycle 15: (0, 14, 17, 6, 3, 0)
- Cycle 16: (13, 5, 9, 14, 0, 13)
- Cycle 17: (3, 6, 17, 14, 12, 3)
- Cycle 18: (8, 9, 6, 17, 14, 8)
- Cycle 19: (19, 9, 6, 17, 14, 0, 19)
- Cycle 20: (15, 4, 12, 14, 8, 15)
- Cycle 21: (1, 5, 9, 6, 17, 14, 1)
- Cycle 22: (2, 11, 17, 14, 0, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (5, 1), 9, 6, 3, 5>
- <2, (14, 8), 17, 6, 3, 0, 2>
- <3, (14, 12), 6, 9, 14>
- <4, (0, 7), 11, 17, 14>
- <5, (10, 18), 4, 12, 14>
- <6, (0, 17), 6, 9, 14>
- <7, (8, 10), 14, 17, 11>
- <8, (0, 12), 11, 17, 14>
- <9, (4, 18), 12, 14, 0>
- <10, (0, 7), 11, 17, 14>
- <11, (4, 15), 12, 14, 8>
- <12, (0, 3), 6, 9, 14>
- <13, (0, 19), 9, 6, 17, 14>
- <14, (7, 11), 17, 14, 0>
- <15, (3, 12), 14, 17, 6>
- <16, (0, 13), 5, 9, 14>
- <17, (3, 6), 17, 14, 12>
- <18, (6, 17), 14, 0, 7>
- <19, (8, 14), 12, 4, 18>
- <20, (0, 7), 11, 17, 14>
- <21, (8, 15), 4, 12, 14>
- <22, (0, 2), 11, 17, 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 22 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
So, the final answer is [22].
