Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle: 1-6-9-7-1
2. Cycle: 1-5-6-4-1
3. Cycle: 1-5-6-2-1
4. Cycle: 1-3-7-9-1
5. Cycle: 1-3-7-8-1
6. Cycle: 1-0-3-7-1
7. Cycle: 1-0-3-2-1
8. Cycle: 9-7-3-0-9
9. Cycle: 9-8-3-0-9
10. Cycle: 8-4-6-2-8
11. Cycle: 8-4-5-1-8
12. Cycle: 8-4-5-6-8
13. Cycle: 8-2-6-4-8

Step 2:
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, the following chordal 4-cycles are found:
1. <1, (6, 9), 7>
2. <1, (5, 6), 4>
3. <1, (5, 2), 6>
4. <1, (7, 9), 3>
5. <1, (7, 8), 3>
6. <1, (0, 3), 7>
7. <1, (0, 2), 3>
8. <9, (7, 3), 0>
9. <9, (8, 3), 0>
10. <8, (6, 4), 2>
11. <8, (5, 4), 1>
12. <8, (5, 6), 4>
13. <8, (2, 6), 4>

Step 3:
There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
