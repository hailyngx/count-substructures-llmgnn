Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Possible cycles in the graph:
1. Cycle 1-7-6-5-1
2. Cycle 1-7-4-2-1
3. Cycle 1-7-3-9-1
4. Cycle 1-8-9-2-1
5. Cycle 1-8-3-7-1
6. Cycle 1-8-4-7-1
7. Cycle 1-8-3-4-1
8. Cycle 1-5-6-0-1
9. Cycle 1-5-6-7-1
10. Cycle 1-0-6-7-1
11. Cycle 1-0-9-8-1
12. Cycle 1-0-8-3-1
13. Cycle 1-0-8-4-1
14. Cycle 1-0-8-9-1
15. Cycle 1-2-4-7-1
16. Cycle 1-2-7-3-1
17. Cycle 1-2-9-0-1
18. Cycle 1-2-9-8-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 7, 3, 9>, chord (2, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
