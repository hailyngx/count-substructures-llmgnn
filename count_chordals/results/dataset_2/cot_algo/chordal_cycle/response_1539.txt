- <3, 15, 19, 10> (Chord: 15-10)
- <3, 15, 19, 16> (Chord: 19-16)
- <3, 15, 19, 11> (Chord: 15-19)
- <3, 1, 18, 8> (Chord: 18-8)
- <3, 0, 7, 17> (Chord: 7-17)
- <15, 10, 19, 11> (Chord: 19-11)
- <10, 13, 6, 3> (Chord: 13-6)
- <10, 13, 12, 17> (Chord: 13-12)
- <15, 17, 12, 2> (Chord: 17-12)
- <17, 7, 0, 16> (Chord: 7-16)
- <0, 3, 6, 13> (Chord: 6-13)
