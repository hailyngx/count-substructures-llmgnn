Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 19) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 10) (2, 16) (2, 7) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 19) (4, 17) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 10) (14, 7) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 19) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- <0, 1, 10, 2>: (0, 1), (1, 10), (10, 2), (2, 0)
- <2, 7, 14, 10>: (2, 7), (7, 14), (14, 10), (10, 2)
- <2, 16, 12, 11>: (2, 16), (16, 12), (12, 11), (11, 2)
- <4, 6, 13, 11>: (4, 6), (6, 13), (13, 11), (11, 4)
- <7, 14, 10, 1>: (7, 14), (14, 10), (10, 1), (1, 7)
- <7, 3, 0, 1>: (7, 3), (3, 0), (0, 1), (1, 7)
- <11, 12, 16, 2>: (11, 12), (12, 16), (16, 2), (2, 11)
- <13, 6, 7, 2>: (13, 6), (6, 7), (7, 2), (2, 13)
- <13, 11, 12, 16>: (13, 11), (11, 12), (12, 16), (16, 13)
- <15, 9, 19, 17>: (15, 9), (9, 19), (19, 17), (17, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 1, 10, 2>: No chord
- <2, 7, 14, 10>: No chord
- <2, 16, 12, 11>: No chord
- <4, 6, 13, 11>: No chord
- <7, 14, 10, 1>: (7, 10)
- <7, 3, 0, 1>: (0, 3)
- <11, 12, 16, 2>: (11, 16)
- <13, 6, 7, 2>: (6, 7)
- <13, 11, 12, 16>: (11, 16)
- <15, 9, 19, 17>: (9, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are [5] chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
