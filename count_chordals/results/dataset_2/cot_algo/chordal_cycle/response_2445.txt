Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, 7, 14, 4, 15>
- <0, 20, 8, 22, 18>
- <1, 29, 18, 22, 27>
- <1, 29, 6, 25, 11>
- <2, 14, 17, 23, 12>
- <2, 17, 28, 20, 8>
- <4, 14, 17, 23, 12>
- <5, 16, 26, 27, 12>
- <6, 29, 3, 18, 22>
- <6, 29, 1, 24, 27>
- <7, 14, 17, 23, 12>
- <8, 22, 27, 26, 16>
- <9, 22, 27, 26, 16>
- <9, 22, 18, 29, 1>
- <10, 13, 1, 24, 27>
- <11, 25, 6, 16, 5>
- <11, 25, 24, 27, 12>
- <12, 27, 22, 18, 29>
- <13, 1, 29, 18, 22>
- <14, 17, 28, 20, 8>
- <15, 20, 8, 22, 18>
- <16, 26, 27, 12, 23>
- <17, 28, 20, 8, 10>
- <18, 29, 1, 11, 25>
- <19, 5, 16, 26, 27>
- <20, 8, 22, 27, 26>
- <21, 2, 17, 28, 20>
- <22, 27, 26, 16, 5>
- <23, 17, 14, 7, 0>
- <24, 27, 22, 18, 29>
- <25, 11, 29, 1, 13>
- <26, 16, 5, 19, 16>
- <27, 12, 23, 17, 14>
- <28, 20, 8, 10, 13>
- <29, 18, 22, 8, 20>

Step 2:

Of the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, 29, 6, (25), 11>
- <6, 29, 3, (18), 22>
- <6, 29, 1, (24), 27>
- <13, 1, (29), 18, 22>
- <17, 28, 20, (8), 22>
- <23, 17, 14, (7), 0>
- <25, 11, 29, (1), 13>

Step 3:

The number of chordless cycles found is [22].
