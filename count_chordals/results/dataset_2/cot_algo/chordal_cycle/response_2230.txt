Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 14) (26, 22) (26, 3) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 1) (22, 26) (22, 18) (22, 21) (10, 20) (17, 3) (17, 24) (29, 20) (29, 13) (29, 8) (29, 23) (0, 4) (0, 23) (14, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 25) (4, 2) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 29) (8, 7) (8, 25) (20, 10) (20, 29) (20, 27) (20, 28) (19, 15) (19, 6) (1, 18) (1, 6) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 24) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 21) (12, 15) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 27) (11, 6) (11, 13) (24, 17) (24, 2) (24, 3) (24, 5) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 28) (3, 26) (3, 17) (3, 24) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 23) (15, 28) (25, 4) (25, 8) (23, 29) (23, 0) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 28) (21, 22) (21, 12) (13, 29) (13, 16) (13, 11) (27, 20) (27, 16) (28, 20) (28, 5) (28, 15) (28, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (1, 18, 4, 0, 1)
- (2, 4, 0, 23, 2)
- (2, 7, 23, 15, 2)
- (3, 17, 24, 3)
- (4, 18, 1, 6, 4)
- (4, 25, 8, 7, 4)
- (5, 24, 3, 17, 5)
- (6, 1, 18, 22, 6)
- (7, 8, 25, 4, 7)
- (11, 6, 1, 18, 11)
- (12, 2, 4, 18, 12)
- (13, 29, 20, 27, 13)
- (15, 23, 0, 4, 15)
- (16, 13, 29, 20, 16)
- (19, 6, 1, 18, 19)
- (20, 29, 13, 11, 20)
- (21, 22, 18, 4, 21)
- (24, 17, 3, 26, 24)
- (25, 8, 29, 20, 25)
- (27, 20, 29, 13, 27)
- (28, 23, 15, 19, 28)

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5)>
- <2, (13)>
- <3, (19)>
- <4, (21)>
- <6, (11)>
- <7, (25)>
- <15, (28)>

Step 3:
Final count of chordal 4-cycles: [7]
