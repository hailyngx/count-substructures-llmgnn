Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-2-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-6-1-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-4-7-5
- Cycle 4: 5-9-2-8-5
- Cycle 5: 5-9-4-8-5
- Cycle 6: 5-4-7-0-5
- Cycle 7: 5-4-8-2-5
- Cycle 8: 5-4-9-2-5
- Cycle 9: 5-1-6-9-5
- Cycle 10: 5-1-7-4-5
- Cycle 11: 5-1-7-0-5
- Cycle 12: 5-1-8-2-5
- Cycle 13: 5-1-8-4-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has chord (6, 2).
- Cycle 2 has chord (6, 1).
- Cycle 3 has chord (4, 7).
- Cycle 4 has chord (9, 2).
- Cycle 5 has chord (4, 8).
- Cycle 6 has chord (7, 0).
- Cycle 7 has chord (4, 8).
- Cycle 8 has chord (4, 9).
- Cycle 9 has chord (1, 6).
- Cycle 10 has chord (1, 7).
- Cycle 11 has chord (1, 7).
- Cycle 12 has chord (1, 8).
- Cycle 13 has chord (1, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

There are no chordless cycles in this graph.
