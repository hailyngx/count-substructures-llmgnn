- Cycle 4: Chord (8, 2)
- Cycle 5: Chord (8, 6)
- Cycle 6: Chord (9, 3)
- Cycle 7: Chord (9, 8)
- Cycle 8: Chord (9, 3)
- Cycle 9: Chord (8, 3)
- Cycle 10: Chord (8, 7)
- Cycle 11: Chord (8, 6)
- Cycle 12: No chord (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 13: Chord (8, 9)
- Cycle 14: Chord (8, 3)
- Cycle 15: Chord (8, 7)
- Cycle 16: Chord (8, 3)
- Cycle 17: Chord (8, 6)
- Cycle 18: Chord (8, 2)
- Cycle 19: Chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 20: No chord (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 21: Chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 22: Chord (9, 3)
- Cycle 23: Chord (8, 2)
- Cycle 24: Chord (8, 7)
- Cycle 25: Chord (2, 4)
- Cycle 26: No chord (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 27: Chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 28: Chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 29: No chord (Chordless cycle)
- Cycle 30: Chord (7, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<6, (9, 3), 6>
<8, (2, 7), 8>
<2, (0, 4), 1>
