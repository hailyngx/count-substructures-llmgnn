Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 0) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-11-7-4 (length 5)
- Cycle 2: 5-9-14-11-6-6 (length 5)
- Cycle 3: 1-5-9-14-13-4 (length 5)
- Cycle 4: 1-9-14-13-0-6 (length 5)
- Cycle 5: 1-9-7-4-10-8 (length 5)
- Cycle 6: 1-9-7-11-6-0 (length 5)
- Cycle 7: 1-3-13-4-10-8-2 (length 7)
- Cycle 8: 1-3-13-0-6-11-7 (length 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: 9-11
- Cycle 2 has a chord: 9-11
- Cycle 3 has a chord: 9-13
- Cycle 4 has a chord: 9-6
- Cycle 5 has a chord: 9-7
- Cycle 6 has a chord: 9-7
- Cycle 7 has no chords
- Cycle 8 has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <5, (9, 11), 6>
- <5, (9, 11), 14>
- <1, (9, 13), 14>
- <1, (9, 6), 14>
- <1, (9, 7), 14>
- <1, (9, 7), 6>
- <1, 3, 13, 4, 10, 8, 2>
- <1, 3, 13, 0, 6, 11, 7>
