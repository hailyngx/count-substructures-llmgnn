Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 14) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 21) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 22) (17, 4) (22, 17) (22, 19) (22, 11) (23, 18) (23, 21) (23, 16) (20, 25) (20, 13) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 8) (25, 10) (1, 14) (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 13) (6, 17) (6, 21) (6, 26) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 6) (21, 8) (21, 2) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 8) (16, 23) (16, 0) (16, 18) (19, 14) (19, 22) (19, 25) (19, 12) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 0) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 13) (11, 22) (11, 20) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 4) (24, 9) (3, 26) (3, 12) (29, 15) (29, 27) (29, 1) (10, 25) (26, 6) (26, 3) (26, 2) (2, 15) (2, 21) (2, 26) (2, 4) (9, 25) (9, 24) (9, 12) (18, 23) (18, 0) (18, 16) (4, 17) (4, 24) (4, 2) (12, 19) (12, 28) (12, 3) (12, 9) (13, 20) (13, 1) (13, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, such as:
- Cycle 1: 15-27-21-6-15
- Cycle 2: 14-1-13-20-14
- Cycle 3: 17-22-19-25-17
- Cycle 4: 21-23-16-0-21
- Cycle 5: 25-20-11-24-25
- Cycle 6: 19-14-1-29-19
- Cycle 7: 8-21-27-29-8
- Cycle 8: 9-25-20-13-9
- Cycle 9: 18-23-16-0-18
- Cycle 10: 4-17-22-11-4
- Cycle 11: 12-19-22-11-12
- Cycle 12: 2-15-27-21-2
- Cycle 13: 6-21-8-0-6
- Cycle 14: 3-26-2-4-3
- Cycle 15: 24-11-22-17-24
- Cycle 16: 28-1-14-19-28

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <1, (13, 20), 14)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
