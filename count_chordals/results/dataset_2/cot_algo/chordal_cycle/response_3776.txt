Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 10) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 11) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more with all existing edges:
- Cycle 1: <1, 4, 6, 5, 1>
- Cycle 2: <2, 7, 8, 3, 2>
- Cycle 3: <9, 13, 6, 5, 9>
- Cycle 4: <10, 7, 2, 11, 10>
- Cycle 5: <12, 7, 10, 5, 12>
- Cycle 6: <13, 6, 4, 1, 13>
- Cycle 7: <14, 9, 11, 3, 14>
- Cycle 8: <0, 14, 9, 13, 0>

Step 2:
Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Only Cycle 8 has exactly one chord <0, 9>.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, 14, 9, 13, 0> with chord <0, 9>
