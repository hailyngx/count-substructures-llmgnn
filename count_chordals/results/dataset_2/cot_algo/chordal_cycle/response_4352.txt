Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 23) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 18) (1, 26) (1, 11) (1, 4) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 0) (23, 27) (23, 22) (23, 9) (14, 15) (14, 4) (17, 2) (0, 27) (0, 22) (2, 17) (2, 29) (2, 10) (2, 25) (29, 27) (29, 2) (29, 12) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 29) (12, 13) (12, 9) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 20) (21, 28) (21, 13) (28, 15) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 19) (13, 12) (13, 21) (13, 11) (24, 26) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 19) (25, 2) (25, 8) (25, 18) (18, 3) (18, 25) (18, 9) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 20) (6, 3) (6, 22) (6, 7) (19, 28) (19, 24) (19, 11) (19, 10) (9, 23) (9, 12) (9, 28) (9, 18) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 4) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 16) (10, 2) (10, 24) (10, 19) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 7) (8, 25) (5, 24) (5, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

The cycles with 4 or more nodes are:
1. Cycle (1, 14, 15, 27)
2. Cycle (2, 17, 29, 12)
3. Cycle (2, 17, 29, 27)
4. Cycle (2, 29, 27, 23)
5. Cycle (3, 6, 22, 23)
6. Cycle (3, 6, 22, 0)
7. Cycle (3, 16, 5, 24)
8. Cycle (3, 16, 20, 26)
9. Cycle (3, 18, 25, 2)
10. Cycle (6, 22, 0, 27)
11. Cycle (6, 22, 0, 3)
12. Cycle (6, 22, 23, 9)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. Cycle (1, 14, 15, 27) with chord (15, 14)
2. Cycle (2, 17, 29, 12) with chord (29, 17)
3. Cycle (2, 17, 29, 27) with chord (29, 17)
4. Cycle (2, 29, 27, 23) with chord (27, 23)
5. Cycle (3, 6, 22, 23) with chord (6, 22)
6. Cycle (3, 6, 22, 0) with chord (6, 22)
7. Cycle (3, 16, 5, 24) with chord (5, 16)
8. Cycle (3, 16, 20, 26) with chord (16, 26)
9. Cycle (3, 18, 25, 2) with chord (25, 18)
10. Cycle (6, 22, 0, 27) with chord (22, 27)
11. Cycle (6, 22, 0, 3) with chord (22, 3)
12. Cycle (6, 22, 23, 9) with chord (22, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0]. 

No unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord was found.
