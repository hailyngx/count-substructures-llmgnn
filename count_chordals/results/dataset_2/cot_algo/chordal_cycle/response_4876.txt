Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 18) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 1) (9, 27) (18, 11) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 20) (18, 1) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 17) (2, 18) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 27) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 14) (26, 22) (26, 12) (28, 11) (28, 13) (13, 28) (13, 25) (13, 19) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 25) (17, 22) (0, 21) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 23) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 22) (4, 10) (8, 21) (8, 7) (12, 26) (12, 21) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 14) (24, 11) (24, 15) (15, 7) (15, 24) (15, 19) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 25) (14, 29) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 23) (14, 5) (27, 9) (27, 2) (20, 9) (20, 18) (21, 0) (21, 8) (21, 12) (25, 13) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 5) (23, 2) (23, 10) (23, 14) (5, 14) (5, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 4, 22)
- Cycle 2: (9, 1, 25, 13)
- Cycle 3: (1, 25, 5, 14)
- Cycle 4: (18, 22, 17, 4)
- Cycle 5: (18, 22, 4, 10)
- Cycle 6: (18, 1, 9, 6)
- Cycle 7: (22, 17, 4, 10)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <11, (4, 22), 16>
- Cycle 2: <9, (1, 13), 25>
- Cycle 3: <1, (5, 14), 25>
- Cycle 4: <18, (4, 17), 22>
- Cycle 5: <18, (4, 10), 22>
- Cycle 6: <18, (1, 9), 6>
- Cycle 7: <22, (4, 10), 17>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [7] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<11, (4, 22), 16>
<9, (1, 13), 25>
<1, (5, 14), 25>
<18, (4, 17), 22>
<18, (4, 10), 22>
<18, (1, 9), 6>
<22, (4, 10), 17>
