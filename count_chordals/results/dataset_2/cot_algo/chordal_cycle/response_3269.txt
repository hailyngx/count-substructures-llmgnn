Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 14) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 20) (13, 15) (13, 10) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 10) (25, 6) (25, 12) (25, 18) (12, 25) (12, 17) (12, 23) (27, 14) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 9) (1, 4) (17, 12) (17, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 6) (26, 28) (26, 16) (26, 0) (26, 7) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 15) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 21) (18, 25) (18, 9) (18, 21) (16, 29) (16, 26) (16, 24) (24, 2) (24, 16) (24, 23) (24, 15) (5, 8) (5, 20) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 15) (0, 28) (0, 26) (6, 25) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 23) (7, 26) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 23) (4, 1) (4, 17) (21, 9) (21, 18) (10, 13) (10, 20) (10, 3) (10, 7) (14, 29) (14, 27) (14, 15) (23, 12) (23, 24) (23, 6) (23, 7) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 2-29-14-27-2
- Cycle 2: 2-24-23-12-17-4-1-2
- Cycle 3: 2-24-15-5-20-13-10-3-2
- Cycle 4: 29-16-26-7-23-12-25-6-11-3-29
- Cycle 5: 8-13-10-7-26-0-28-9-18-21-9-8

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has the following chordal 4-cycle: <2, (13, 26), 16>

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <2, (13, 26), 16>
