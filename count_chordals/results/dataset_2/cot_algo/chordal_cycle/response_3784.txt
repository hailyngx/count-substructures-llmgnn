Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 4 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 2 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 9 - 3 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 0 - 3 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 5: 5 - 1 - 0 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 6: 5 - 9 - 1 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 7: 5 - 6 - 8 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 8: 5 - 6 - 0 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 9: 5 - 1 - 2 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 10: 5 - 0 - 1 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 11: 5 - 7 - 3 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 12: 5 - 7 - 3 - 0 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 4>: Cycle 1 has exactly one chord 4-8.
- <2, 8>: Cycle 2 has exactly one chord 2-8.
- <3, 7>: Cycle 3 has exactly one chord 3-7.
- <0, 3>: Cycle 4 has exactly one chord 0-3.
- <0, 3>: Cycle 5 has exactly one chord 0-3.
- <1, 2>: Cycle 6 has exactly one chord 1-2.
- <6, 8>: Cycle 7 has exactly one chord 6-8.
- <0, 1>: Cycle 8 has exactly one chord 0-1.
- <2, 9>: Cycle 9 has exactly one chord 2-9.
- <1, 9>: Cycle 10 has exactly one chord 1-9.
- <3, 5>: Cycle 11 has exactly one chord 3-5.
- <3, 5>: Cycle 12 has exactly one chord 3-5.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]
