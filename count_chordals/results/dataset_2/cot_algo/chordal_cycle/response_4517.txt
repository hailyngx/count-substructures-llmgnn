Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 1) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. Here are some of the cycles present in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-2-8-13-6-7-14-1-9-10 (length 9)
- Cycle 2: 5-9-1-2-8-13-4-14-7-6 (length 9)
- Cycle 3: 5-8-13-3-2-1-14-0-6-7 (length 9)
- Cycle 4: 1-9-10-12-13-3-2-5-14 (length 8)
- Cycle 5: 1-9-10-12-7-6-13-8-2 (length 8)
- Cycle 6: 1-14-7-6-13-8-2-5-9 (length 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 
- Cycle 1 has a chord 2-13.
- Cycle 2 has a chord 8-14.
- Cycle 3 has a chord 8-2.
- Cycle 4 has a chord 9-2.
- Cycle 5 has a chord 9-8.
- Cycle 6 has a chord 14-8.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordless cycles is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (2, 13), 5, 9>
<2, (8, 14), 5, 9>
<3, (2, 8), 5, 9>
<4, (2, 9), 1, 14>
<5, (8, 9), 1, 14>
<6, (8, 14), 1, 2>
