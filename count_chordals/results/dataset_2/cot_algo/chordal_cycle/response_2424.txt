Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (4, 7, 9, 6)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 7, 3, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (4, 7, 8, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 2, 9, 1)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 6, 9, 1)
        - Cycle 6: (7, 9, 1, 8)
        - Cycle 7: (7, 3, 5, 2)
        - Cycle 8: (7, 8, 1, 0)
        - Cycle 9: (6, 9, 1, 8)
        - Cycle 10: (9, 1, 8, 7)
        - Cycle 11: (9, 7, 8, 6)
        - Cycle 12: (1, 8, 7, 3)
        - Cycle 13: (3, 5, 2, 4)
        - Cycle 14: (3, 2, 4, 0)
        - Cycle 15: (3, 1, 8, 7)
        - Cycle 16: (8, 7, 3, 5)
        - Cycle 17: (5, 3, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 18: (0, 4, 2, 9)
        - Cycle 19: (0, 1, 8, 7)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
        - <4, 6, (9, 7), 9>: Chord (9, 7)
        - <4, 2, (9, 1), 1>: Chord (9, 1)
        - <3, 5, (7, 2), 4>: Chord (7, 2)
        - <1, 8, (7, 3), 5>: Chord (7, 3)
        - <3, 2, (7, 4), 0>: Chord (7, 4)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
        There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
