Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle <5, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle <5, 4, 6, 0>
- Cycle <9, 4, 8, 7>
- Cycle <9, 4, 6, 0>
- Cycle <4, 8, 7, 2>
- Cycle <4, 6, 7, 0>
- Cycle <8, 7, 2, 3>
- Cycle <8, 7, 1, 5>
- Cycle <6, 7, 2, 3>
- Cycle <7, 1, 5, 6>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <5, 4, 9, 8> has chord (4, 8), so not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle <5, 4, 6, 0> has chord (4, 6), so not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle <9, 4, 8, 7> has chord (4, 7), so not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle <9, 4, 6, 0> has chord (4, 0), so not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle <4, 8, 7, 2> has chord (8, 7), so not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle <4, 6, 7, 0> has chord (6, 7), so not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle <8, 7, 2, 3> has chord (7, 2), so not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle <8, 7, 1, 5> has chord (7, 5), so not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle <6, 7, 2, 3> has chord (7, 2), so not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle <7, 1, 5, 6> has chord (1, 5), so not a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
