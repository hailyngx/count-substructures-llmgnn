Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 19) (9, 18) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 15) (2, 3) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 15) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (7, 1) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 17) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 17) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 1) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (8, 11, 3, 2, 8)
- (8, 5, 6, 14, 8)
- (8, 12, 0, 14, 8)
- (8, 5, 19, 6, 8)
- (8, 13, 15, 5, 8)
- (13, 8, 12, 18, 13)
- (5, 6, 14, 3, 5)
- (5, 15, 13, 8, 5)
- (5, 19, 17, 8, 5)
- (5, 8, 11, 3, 5)
- (6, 14, 0, 12, 6)
- (6, 5, 8, 13, 6)
- (6, 19, 17, 15, 6)
- (9, 18, 12, 0, 9)
- (14, 0, 12, 18, 14)
- (14, 6, 5, 8, 14)
- (14, 3, 11, 16, 14)
- (15, 13, 8, 17, 15)
- (15, 17, 8, 12, 15)
- (17, 8, 13, 15, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <8, (11, 3), 2, 8>
- <8, (5, 6), 14, 8>
- <8, (12, 0), 14, 8>
- <8, (5, 19), 6, 8>
- <8, (13, 15), 5, 8>
- <13, (8, 12), 18, 13>
- <5, (6, 14), 3, 5>
- <5, (15, 13), 8, 5>
- <5, (19, 17), 8, 5>
- <5, (8, 11), 3, 5>
- <6, (14, 0), 12, 6>
- <6, (5, 8), 13, 6>
- <6, (19, 17), 15, 6>
- <9, (18, 12), 0, 9>
- <14, (0, 12), 18, 14>
- <14, (6, 5), 8, 14>
- <14, (3, 11), 16, 14>
- <15, (13, 8), 17, 15>
- <15, (17, 8), 12, 15>
- <17, (8, 13), 15, 17>

Step 3: Count the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 19 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [19].
