Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 19) (15, 10) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 8) (19, 16) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 16) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 1) (13, 6) (13, 0) (17, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (7, 4, 19, 12) 
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 17, 6) 
- Cycle 3: (6, 3, 7, 12) 
- Cycle 4: (6, 3, 0, 11) 
- Cycle 5: (10, 15, 10, 11) 
- Cycle 6: (18, 2, 1, 14) 
- Cycle 7: (18, 12, 7, 4) 
- Cycle 8: (18, 8, 19, 4) 
- Cycle 9: (12, 1, 14, 11) 
- Cycle 10: (8, 16, 1, 5) 
- Cycle 11: (19, 16, 1, 5) 
- Cycle 12: (0, 11, 14, 1) 
- Cycle 13: (0, 6, 9, 17) 
- Cycle 14: (0, 6, 3, 7) 
- Cycle 15: (0, 6, 13, 0) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <7, (4, 12), 19>
- <6, (9, 17), 6> 
- <6, (3, 7), 12> 
- <6, (3, 0), 11> 
- <10, (15, 11), 10> 
- <18, (2, 1), 14> 
- <18, (12, 7), 4> 
- <18, (8, 19), 4> 
- <12, (1, 14), 11> 
- <8, (16, 1), 5> 
- <19, (16, 5), 1> 
- <0, (11, 14), 1> 
- <0, (6, 9), 17> 
- <0, (6, 3), 7> 
- <0, (6, 13), 0> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 15 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [15].
