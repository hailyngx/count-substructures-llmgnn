Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (5, 9, 4, 7, 5)
2. (5, 3, 9, 1, 5)
3. (5, 7, 4, 8, 5)
4. (5, 0, 6, 8, 5)
5. (9, 1, 7, 4, 9)
6. (9, 3, 5, 7, 9)
7. (4, 7, 1, 9, 4)
8. (7, 1, 9, 5, 7)
9. (7, 4, 9, 1, 7)
10. (1, 9, 4, 7, 1)
11. (1, 3, 5, 9, 1)
12. (3, 5, 7, 1, 3)
13. (8, 4, 7, 1, 8)
14. (8, 7, 5, 3, 8)
15. (8, 1, 9, 3, 8)
16. (8, 3, 1, 9, 8)
17. (8, 2, 1, 7, 8)
18. (8, 6, 0, 5, 8)
19. (6, 0, 5, 9, 6)
20. (6, 7, 1, 9, 6)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, (7, 4), 9>
2. <8, (1, 9), 3>
3. <8, (7, 5), 3>
4. <8, (2, 1), 7>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [16].
