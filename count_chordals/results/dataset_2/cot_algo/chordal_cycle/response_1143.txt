Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-9-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-5-6-0
- Cycle 3: 0-8-1-5-0
- Cycle 4: 1-8-0-5-1
- Cycle 5: 2-4-9-3-2
- Cycle 6: 2-7-5-6-2
- Cycle 7: 2-9-3-5-2
- Cycle 8: 2-6-5-1-2
- Cycle 9: 3-7-5-0-3
- Cycle 10: 3-9-2-7-3

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, we can find the following chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (0, 2), 5>

Step 3:
As we found one chordal 4-cycle, the final count is [1].
