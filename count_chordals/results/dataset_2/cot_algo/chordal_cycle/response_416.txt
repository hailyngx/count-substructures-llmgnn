        - Cycle 127: <29, 9, 1, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        Chordal 4-cycles found:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 5, 27, 12> with chord (5, 27)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <12, 15, 14, 25> with chord (15, 14)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <17, 20, 21, 12> with chord (20, 21)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <24, 13, 17, 20> with chord (13, 17)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <26, 22, 28, 13> with chord (22, 28)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [122].
