Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 7, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 9, 7, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 9, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 4, 3, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 8, 3, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 8, 3, 1, 0, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 0)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (4, 5)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (8, 1)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (8, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found in this graph, so the number of chordal 4-cycles is [0].
