Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 5) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (10, 15) (10, 6) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (12, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 5) (16, 3) (16, 18) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 15) (5, 14) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 13) (9, 0) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 7) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 13) (8, 17) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- <1, 6, 11, 14> (length 4)
- <4, 6, 1, 15> (length 4)
- <4, 6, 10, 15> (length 4)
- <4, 9, 1, 15> (length 4)
- <4, 9, 19, 17> (length 4)
- <6, 1, 15, 10> (length 4)
- <6, 4, 9, 19> (length 4)
- <6, 10, 15, 1> (length 4)
- <7, 1, 15, 10> (length 4)
- <7, 13, 9, 19> (length 4)
- <7, 17, 19, 0> (length 4)
- <9, 1, 15, 10> (length 4)
- <9, 4, 14, 11> (length 4)
- <9, 13, 7, 17> (length 4)
- <9, 19, 17, 1> (length 4)
- <13, 9, 1, 15> (length 4)
- <17, 1, 15, 10> (length 4)
- <17, 7, 13, 9> (length 4)
- <19, 9, 1, 15> (length 4)
- <19, 17, 1, 15> (length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, 6, 11, 14> has chord (6, 14)
- <4, 6, 1, 15> has chord (4, 15)
- <4, 6, 10, 15> has chord (4, 10)
- <4, 9, 1, 15> has chord (4, 1)
- <4, 9, 19, 17> has chord (4, 17)
- <6, 1, 15, 10> has chord (6, 10)
- <6, 4, 9, 19> has chord (6, 9)
- <6, 10, 15, 1> has chord (6, 15)
- <7, 1, 15, 10> has chord (7, 10)
- <7, 13, 9, 19> has chord (7, 9)
- <7, 17, 19, 0> has chord (7, 19)
- <9, 1, 15, 10> has chord (9, 10)
- <9, 4, 14, 11> has chord (9, 14)
- <9, 13, 7, 17> has chord (9, 7)
- <9, 19, 17, 1> has chord (9, 17)
- <13, 9, 1, 15> has chord (13, 1)
- <17, 1, 15, 10> has chord (17, 15)
- <17, 7, 13, 9> has chord (17, 13)
- <19, 9, 1, 15> has chord (19, 1)
- <19, 17, 1, 15> has chord (19, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [20].
