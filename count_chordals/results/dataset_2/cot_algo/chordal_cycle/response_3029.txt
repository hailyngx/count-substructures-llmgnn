Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are two cycles of length 4 in the graph: (0, 10, 2, 7) and (1, 11, 8, 7).
- There is one cycle of length 5 in the graph: (5, 0, 10, 14, 11).
- There are no cycles of length greater than 5 in the graph.

Step 2:
- The cycle (0, 10, 2, 7) has one chord: (10, 2).
- The cycle (1, 11, 8, 7) has one chord: (11, 8).
- The cycle (5, 0, 10, 14, 11) has no chords.

Step 3:
- There are two chordal 4-cycles: 
   <0, 10, 2, 7> with one chord (10, 2)
   <1, 11, 8, 7> with one chord (11, 8)

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
