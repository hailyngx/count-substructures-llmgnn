Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 6, 1, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 8, 2, 4)
        - Cycle 3: (4, 6, 1, 4)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has one chord: (6, 1)
        - Cycle 2 has one chord: (8, 2)
        - Cycle 3 has one chord: (6, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <1, 5, 6, (1, 5)>
        <2, 4, 8, (2, 8)>
        <3, 4, 6, (1, 6)>
