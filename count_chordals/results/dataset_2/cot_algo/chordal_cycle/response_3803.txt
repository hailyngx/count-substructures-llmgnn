Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 14) (26, 22) (26, 4) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 5) (2, 13) (2, 27) (2, 4) (8, 15) (8, 25) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 11) (17, 0) (17, 20) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (20, 17) (20, 18) (20, 16) (20, 10) (18, 20) (18, 10) (18, 12) (29, 13) (10, 20) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 23) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 6) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (16, 17) (16, 20) (16, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (6, 15) (6, 24) (6, 12) (6, 4) (11, 14) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 21) (24, 6) (24, 19) (24, 25) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 7) (19, 11) (19, 24) (19, 28) (19, 13) (25, 8) (25, 24) (25, 28) (25, 21) (27, 2) (13, 2) (13, 29) (13, 19) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 6) (28, 19) (28, 25) (21, 11) (21, 25) (21, 23) (23, 10) (23, 21) (5, 14) (5, 7) (4, 26) (4, 2) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4: 
- Cycle 1: 0-1-7-5-0
- Cycle 2: 2-4-6-12-2
- Cycle 3: 2-4-6-24-2
- Cycle 4: 2-13-19-11-2
- Cycle 5: 7-14-11-19-7
- Cycle 6: 7-16-20-17-7
- Cycle 7: 8-15-10-18-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, (1, 7), 5>
- <2, (4, 6), 12>
- <2, (13, 19), 11>
- <7, (14, 11), 19>
- <7, (16, 20), 17>
- <8, (15, 10), 18>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are [6] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
