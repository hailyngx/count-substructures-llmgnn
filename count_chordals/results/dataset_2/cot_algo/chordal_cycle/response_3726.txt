Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 7 - 5 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 7 - 5 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 3: 3 - 4 - 7 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 4: 6 - 9 - 1 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 5: 8 - 9 - 6 - 0 - 8

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord (0, 6)
- Cycle 2 has chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 3 has chord (4, 5)
- Cycle 4 has chord (6, 1)
- Cycle 5 has no chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal cycles found:
As there are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, (6, 0), 7, 5>
<1, (3, 1), 7, 5>
<3, (4, 5), 7, 5>
<6, (1, 6), 9, 7>
